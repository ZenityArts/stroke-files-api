Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Rebloation Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m thrilled to guide you through a program specifically designed for mesomorphs like you, with an asset above 7 inches. Your physique—defined, muscular, and naturally balanced—provides you with power and endurance that, when harnessed with precision, translates into a performance of cumulative, targeted stimulation. While your extended asset gives you incredible reach and the ability to provide deep stimulation, our aim is to channel that power with controlled finesse so that every movement delivers the optimal balance of pleasure.
Imagine stepping into your personal training space—a quiet, dedicated arena where all distractions melt away, and your entire focus is on perfecting your technique. Feel the firm, supportive floor beneath your feet; it’s a mirror of the unwavering stability of your mesomorph build. Take several deep, deliberate breaths; with every inhale, draw in pure, concentrated energy, and with every exhale, let go of any tension. This is your space, brother—a sanctuary where raw potential is transformed into an intimate work of art.
We begin by adapting the classic missionary position to suit your athletic, muscular frame. Get into a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a surface built to support your substantial mass and dynamic power. This anchoring stance is fundamental—it locks your body in place so that every micro‑movement, from the precise twist of your hips to the final lateral shift, is executed with deliberate control. Your mesomorph attributes naturally deliver strength and endurance, yet with an extended asset above 7 inches, precision is paramount. You must channel every bit of that power exactly where it yields maximum stimulation without overwhelming her sensitive areas.
Once you’re securely anchored, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Think of this deliberate insertion as the blueprint for your stroke—it sets the precise alignment, pressure points, and angles that will govern every subsequent move. Your Rebloation Stroke unfolds in a structured sequence: you start with a smooth, deliberate forward push, then execute four individual hip rotations to the right, followed by four individual hip rotations to the left, and finally complete the cycle with one calculated lateral shift to the left. With each hip rotation, the hilt of your penis applies controlled pressure along a specific segment of her vaginal opening—on the right side, moving from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, and on the left, from the north‑western to the south‑western segment—while the head of your penis adapts by first directing stimulation toward one wall and then shifting to the opposite side. This sequential layering is what makes the Rebloation Stroke cumulative and balanced.
Because you are a mesomorph with an extension above 7 inches, you have the capacity to deliver deep stimulation; however, it’s critical to adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle. This means that approximately 80% of your force should be dedicated to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining 20% must be evenly distributed between the mid‑depth (roughly 3 to 5 inches) and deep (beyond 5 inches) layers. This force allocation ensures that the stimulation builds gradually and cumulatively, layer by layer, without overloading any single area.
This introduction sets the stage, brother. Here, you learn how to create the ideal environment, assume the proper posture, and channel your powerful mesomorph energy and extended asset into a Rebloation Stroke that transforms raw strength into an artful, cumulative performance. Today marks the beginning of turning your natural potential into a true work of intimate art—a performance where every micro‑movement is orchestrated to deliver targeted, layered pleasure. Welcome, brother—your journey to mastery starts now.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, and Flow
Alright, brother, let’s break down the core scientific and technical principles that form the foundation of your Rebloation Stroke. These are the building blocks that transform your natural power into the cumulative, precise stimulation required for ultimate intimate mastery.
First, let’s talk about the 80‑10‑10 principle. Picture this as your force‑distribution blueprint. About 80% of the force you deliver should be concentrated on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because this area is packed with nerve endings, making it the most sensitive and the key area for delivering maximal pleasure. The remaining 20% of your force isn’t wasted; it’s split evenly so that 10% of your energy stimulates the mid‑depth zone (approximately 3 to 5 inches) and the other 10% engages the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as a mesomorph with an extended asset above 7 inches, this means that even though your reach allows for deeper stimulation, your primary focus must remain on that ultra‑sensitive shallow area. This force distribution guarantees that each repetition builds cumulative stimulation, layer by layer, without overwhelming any particular area.
Now, let’s break down the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic, step‑by‑step method for continuously refining your technique. This process starts with clear goal setting. For the Rebloation Stroke, your goal might be to maximize the cumulative effect of every single hip rotation, ensuring that each move contributes precisely to building a layered, targeted stimulation. Once your goal is set, you form a hypothesis. Perhaps you suspect that a slightly slower rotation or a subtle adjustment in your hip angle will yield a better cumulative effect. With that hypothesis in place, you move to tracking—a critical phase where you perform about 30 repetitions of each component, paying close attention to your body’s signals, such as engaging your core and pelvic floor, and, most importantly, listening to your partner’s feedback. Her deep, rhythmic breathing, subtle body adjustments, and soft verbal cues serve as immediate, real‑time data, showing you which movements produce the best cumulative stimulation. Tracking allows you to fine‑tune your stroke in real time, making precise adjustments to your angle, speed, and force.
Once you’ve gathered enough tracking data, you transition into a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical, almost indescribable condition where every micro‑movement—from the deliberate forward push to the swift, controlled hip rotations—occurs seamlessly and automatically. When you’re in flow, your body moves on instinct, delivering the exact pressure and timing that tracking has helped you perfect, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with each repetition.
Unlike some strokes that require separate drills for lateral movements, the keystrokes for the Rebloation Stroke are inherent in the pattern of your hip rotations and the final lateral shift. Training involves isolating each rotation and drilling it until it becomes second nature, so that every repetition effortlessly contributes to the cumulative effect.
To sum it up, brother: The 80‑10‑10 principle is your force‑distribution guide, ensuring that 80% of your force targets the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone while the remaining 20% is evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep zones; the Sexual Scientific Process—with its cycle of clear goal setting, hypothesis formulation, meticulous tracking, and smooth flow—gives you a systematic approach to refine your technique continuously; and through rigorous drilling of the individual hip rotations and lateral shift, you develop the muscle memory necessary to deliver cumulative stimulation flawlessly. Together, these core principles are the foundation upon which your mastery of the Rebloation Stroke is built.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Rebloation Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Rebloation Stroke step by step, so you have a precise, detailed blueprint for turning your natural mesomorph agility and extended asset into a performance of cumulative, targeted stimulation. The Rebloation Stroke is performed in the classic missionary position—on top in a modified plank with your knees planted securely on the canvas, and your penis inserted at a controlled, downward diagonal angle. Once you’re in position, the stroke unfolds in a clear sequence: you begin with a smooth forward push, then execute four individual hip rotations to the right, followed by four individual hip rotations to the left, and finally, you complete the sequence with one lateral shift to the left.
Start with the forward push. From your anchored position, drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head in a smooth, deliberate motion. As you push, feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide gracefully over her clitoral region while the head maintains continuous, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, the 80‑10‑10 principle instructs you to focus about 80% of your force on the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining 20% is evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep zones. This forward push creates the cumulative base upon which all subsequent hip rotations will add additional layers of stimulation.
Next, enter the first phase: four individual hip rotations to the right. As you initiate each rotation to the right, concentrate on the hilt of your penis applying steady pressure as it “canvasses” the vaginal opening—moving from the north‑eastern segment down to the south‑eastern segment. At the same time, observe how the head of your penis shifts its orientation—initially directing its stimulation toward the southwestern wall and then gradually moving to the north‑western wall with every rotation. Each rotation is a distinct keystroke, building cumulative stimulation layer by layer.
After completing the rotations to the right, seamlessly transition to the second phase: four individual hip rotations to the left. Here, you mirror the process: as you rotate to the left, the hilt applies consistent pressure by canvassing from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head first directs its force toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall with each rotation. This balanced, alternating pattern creates a rhythmic, cumulative effect that ensures even distribution of stimulation across her vaginal canal.
Finally, you conclude the sequence with one additional lateral shift to the left. This final movement further enhances the cumulative effect by ensuring that every area of her canal receives a layer of stimulation. Every movement in the sequence adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that roughly 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, sensitive zone, with the remaining force balanced perfectly between the deeper layers.
This detailed deconstruction gives you a clear, step‑by‑step roadmap for the Rebloation Stroke. It transforms your natural mesomorph agility and extended asset into a series of meticulously coordinated movements that build cumulative, targeted stimulation with every forward push, every hip rotation, and every lateral shift.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now let’s drill each individual component of the Rebloation Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with absolute precision. With your powerful mesomorph build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you have the strength and stability to perform rapid, refined actions—but every hip rotation must be controlled with laser accuracy. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and drill it repeatedly until it’s firmly embedded in your muscle memory, always keeping the 80‑10‑10 principle as your guide.
Begin with the forward push drill. In your modified missionary position, with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that supports your muscular frame, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Then, slowly execute a forward push toward your partner’s head. Focus intently on the sensation: feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Since your extension is moderate, allocate about 80% of your force to the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. Repeat this forward push slowly and methodically until the motion becomes smooth, steady, and completely automatic.
Next, isolate the hip rotation drills. Start with a single rotation to the right. From your secure position, initiate one deliberate hip rotation to the right, concentrating on how the hilt of your penis applies steady pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, observe how the head first directs pressure toward the southwestern wall, then gradually shifts to the north‑western wall. Perform one complete rotation slowly, then pause, reset, and repeat this movement for at least 30 repetitions until the motion is perfectly ingrained in your muscle memory. Then, switch to drilling a single rotation to the left. As you rotate left, ensure that the hilt canvasses smoothly from the north‑western to the south‑western segment while the head initially directs its pressure toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. Alternate these rotations until you can transition seamlessly between right and left, with every rotation faithfully following the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
After you’ve mastered the individual hip rotations, focus on the final lateral shift drill. Slowly shift your entire body laterally to the left, ensuring that the movement is controlled and that your force distribution remains consistent with the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this lateral shift until it integrates naturally with your hip rotations.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing—each deep inhale equips you for the next precise movement, and every deliberate exhale creates a smooth transition between moves. By rigorously repeating these keystrokes—the forward push, the individual right and left hip rotations, and the lateral shift—you build the muscle memory and precision necessary to deliver flawless cumulative stimulation with your Rebloation Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, it’s time to synthesize all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Rebloation Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance—with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your focus entirely on linking every micro‑movement into an uninterrupted, rhythmic cycle. In this integrated sequence, you’ll combine your deliberate forward push with a set of four hip rotations to the right, followed by four hip rotations to the left, and finally wrap the stroke with one controlled lateral shift to complete the pattern.
Begin with the forward push. From your secure position, insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push, executed in strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensures that roughly 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone, laying a solid cumulative foundation.
Immediately after the forward push, enter the first phase: four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation to the right, concentrate on the hilt steadily canvassing from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head gradually transitions from directing pressure toward the southwestern wall to shifting toward the north‑western wall. Each right rotation adds its layer of targeted stimulation.
Once the right rotations are complete, smoothly transition into the left rotation phase—executing four individual hip rotations to the left. As you rotate left, ensure that the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head initially points toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. This alternating, rhythmic pattern ensures that cumulative stimulation is distributed evenly throughout her vaginal canal.
Finally, conclude the sequence with one precise lateral shift to the left. This final move reinforces the cumulative effect by engaging any area that might not have received full stimulation during the rotations. Every movement in your sequence conforms to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that your force is targeted predominantly at the shallow, sensitive zone while the remaining force is distributed to support balanced stimulation.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout the integrated sequence—each deep inhale energizes your next precise move, and every controlled exhale smooths the transitions between the forward push, the hip rotations, and the lateral shift. With each complete cycle, your Rebloation Stroke evolves into a continuous, fluid performance that transforms your natural mesomorph agility and moderate extension into a meticulously orchestrated display of cumulative, targeted stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where every micro‑movement of your Rebloation Stroke is fine‑tuned until your performance is an impeccably executed masterpiece. With your naturally balanced, muscular mesomorph build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, every detail is critical—especially during those individual hip rotations. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains your guiding star, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone while the remainder is evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you perform your integrated sequence, pay close attention to the quality and consistency of each movement. During your forward push, make sure the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When executing your four right and four left hip rotations, observe carefully how the hilt canvasses through her vaginal opening and how the head shifts its pressure—from initially directing it toward one wall to transitioning to the opposite side. This is where rigorous tracking comes in. Every repetition provides you with immediate, real‑time feedback. Listen deeply to her rhythmic breathing, watch for subtle changes in her posture, and be fully attuned to any soft verbal cues that indicate which aspects of your stroke are delivering optimal cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your critical feedback loop, allowing you to make micro-adjustments to speed, angle, or force, ensuring that every rotation is perfectly executed.
Once you’ve gathered enough tracking data—ideally around 30 repetitions for each phase—you naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical condition where every micro‑movement—from your deliberate forward push to each precisely executed hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically, like a finely choreographed dance. In flow, your body instinctively delivers the exact pressure and timing that your tracking has refined, allowing cumulative stimulation to build effortlessly with each cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is essential during this state; every deep inhale primes you for the next move, and every controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions. If any movement appears slightly off, pause, re‑track her feedback, and make small, thoughtful adjustments until your technique is flawless.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training program tailored to reinforce every element of your Rebloation Stroke while also enhancing your core strength and overall stability. With your naturally muscular, balanced mesomorph build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you have the perfect blend of power, agility, and control. This routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that consistently delivers cumulative, targeted stimulation.
Start by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where your focus is solely on mastering your technique. Every session should begin with an extensive warm‑up specifically designed for your mesomorph body. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these are the essential muscle groups that form the foundation for your stability and control, ensuring that every micro‑movement is executed with total precision. Visualize each stretch as igniting the internal engine of your body, priming every muscle and joint for the rigorous drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a determined, positive tone for the session.
Next, move into your specialized drills. Start with the forward push drill in your modified missionary position. Carefully insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and practice a smooth, deliberate forward push toward your partner’s head. As your extension is in the 5‑7‑inch range, focus approximately 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone. Once you have mastered the forward push, isolate the individual hip rotations. Begin with the right hip rotations—practice each rotation slowly, ensuring that the hilt consistently canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment while the head transitions from the southwestern to the north‑western wall. Do this for at least 30 repetitions until the movement is second nature, then mirror the process with left hip rotations until it feels seamless. Finally, drill the concluding lateral shift until it flows effortlessly into your rotation pattern. Alternate these drills until every keystroke of the Rebloation Stroke is permanently engraved in your muscle memory.
Throughout your session, maintain deep, controlled breathing to support each precise move. Supplement your drills with targeted core-strengthening exercises—planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability workouts are essential because your core is the anchor that ensures every rapid movement is executed with maximum control. And be sure to keep a detailed training journal. Record every session, note the repetitions, document any adjustments you make, and capture her feedback. This journal is an indispensable part of the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to track progress and continuously refine your technique until perfection is achieved.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—the zenith of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Rebloation Stroke merges into one continuous, flawless performance. In this final module, your balanced, muscular mesomorph build and your extension between 5 and 7 inches come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of mastery that is both scientifically refined and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified missionary stance—with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core fully engaged, and your mind finely tuned for absolute precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your extension glide effortlessly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is allocated to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is carefully balanced to stimulate the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately after the forward push, transition into the hip rotation phase by executing four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation, focus on the hilt steadily canvassing from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head gradually transitions from directing its pressure toward the southwestern wall to shifting toward the north‑western wall. Then, seamlessly transition into four individual hip rotations to the left. As you rotate left, ensure that the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment while the head initially directs its force toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall. Finally, conclude the sequence with one controlled lateral shift to the left, ensuring the cumulative stimulation reaches every part of her canal.
Throughout the integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale fuels your next precise move, and every measured exhale creates a smooth transition between the forward push, hip rotations, and lateral shift. If any part of your sequence feels off—if a rotation isn’t executed with perfect precision or the pressure isn’t balanced—pause, re‑track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is flawless.
The ultimate goal is to reach a state of natural flow—a condition where every forward push, every hip rotation, and every lateral shift is performed automatically with impeccable precision and cumulative intensity. When that state is achieved, your Rebloation Stroke will evolve into a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers targeted, cumulative stimulation that drives her to climax.
