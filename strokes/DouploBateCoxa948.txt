Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke! I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m excited to work with you—an athletic mesomorph with a penis below 5 inches. Your naturally well‑balanced, muscular build gives you excellent agility and speed, and though your extension is compact, every inch is incredibly sensitive when properly harnessed. Today, we’re going to convert your naturally honed athleticism into a meticulously choreographed sequence of movements that transform raw strength into an artful, cumulative performance.
Before we start, please create your own training sanctuary—a quiet, comfortable space where you can focus fully without distractions. Sit or lie down, relax your defined shoulders, and take several deep, controlled breaths to clear your mind and prepare your body. Our session is about channeling your natural mesomorph power into a precise technique that maximizes intimate stimulation.
We begin by modifying the classic missionary position to suit your athletic mesomorph frame. Start in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. This foundational stance anchors your body and ensures that every micro‑movement is executed with controlled precision. Once you’re stable, insert your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This precise alignment sets the blueprint for all subsequent movements.
Your initial movement is a smooth, measured forward push—moving your entire body slowly northward toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, the top shelf of your compact extension glides gently over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is below 5 inches, it’s vital that you concentrate about 80% of your force on the shallow vaginal zone (the first 1–3 inches), while the remaining 20% is evenly split between the mid‑depth (approximately 3–5 inches) and the deep zones. This is the 80‑10‑10 principle in action—ensuring that the sensitive area receives maximum stimulation.
After the forward push, the stroke moves into its distinctive lateral phase. Thanks to your athletic mesomorph build, you have the agility to execute quick, precise lateral movements. In the left‑side phase, you slowly lower your left hip toward the canvas. As you drop, the hilt of your penis applies focused pressure along the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, producing friction and a gentle rocking massage along her right wall. Then, you raise your left hip back to the center in a smooth reversal that resets the pressure. In the Douplo variation, once you complete this entire sequence on the left, you mirror the same process on the right—ensuring that each side of the vaginal canal is stimulated evenly in a rhythmic “W” pattern.
This introduction lays the foundational mindset for transforming your natural, athletic prowess and compact extension into a precise, cumulative performance. Every forward push, lateral drop, and controlled reset is designed to deliver maximum stimulation in the most sensitive area while ensuring balanced overall contact. Welcome, brother—let’s begin turning your raw potential into an artful, intimate expression with the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke!
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re going to unpack the core principles that underpin every movement in the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. Mastering these elements is essential for executing the stroke with scientific precision and achieving cumulative stimulation.
The 80‑10‑10 Principle This principle guides the distribution of your applied force: approximately 80% should be focused on the shallow vaginal zone (the first 1–3 inches), where nerve endings are most concentrated, making it the most sensitive region. The remaining 20% is equally divided, with 10% devoted to the mid‑depth zone (roughly 3–5 inches) and 10% to the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as a mesomorph with a compact extension, this means every movement must be carefully modulated so that the majority of your stimulation is concentrated precisely where it counts most.
The Sexual Scientific Process This iterative method is your roadmap for refining your stroke. It consists of four steps:
Define Your Goal: Clearly specify what you want to achieve with your stroke—e.g., maximizing friction on a particular side during the lateral drop.
Form a Hypothesis: Based on initial practice, predict which slight adjustments (like changing the angle or pace of your hip drop) might enhance cumulative stimulation.
Track: Methodically perform a high number of repetitions (ideally at least 30 strokes per vaginal “wall”) and record both your internal sensations (such as core engagement and pelvic floor activation) and your partner’s responses (her breathing, subtle movements, verbal cues).
Flow: Once you identify the stroke variation that consistently produces optimal results, commit to that rhythmic, automatic sequence so that your movements become seamless and naturally maintain the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Tracking Tracking means collecting detailed feedback from your performance. As you execute each stroke, observe your partner’s responses and your own internal cues. This systematic data collection allows you to adjust your technique so that the stimulation is always precisely targeted.
Flow Flow is achieved when your movements become instinctive and perfectly rhythmic. In this state, every forward push, lateral drop, and backward shuttle occurs seamlessly without conscious effort, ensuring that the 80‑10‑10 principle is upheld throughout.
The Tap Keystroke The tap keystroke is a foundational drill for perfecting lateral movement. Begin in a stable position, such as a forearm plank, then shift laterally until your hip gently “taps” the supporting surface before returning smoothly to center. This minimal, controlled movement builds muscle memory and strengthens your pelvic floor, particularly when integrated with deep, deliberate breathing (also known as stroke breathing) and kegeling. Mastering the tap keystroke is essential for executing the lateral phase of the stroke with precise control.
Together, these elements—the 80‑10‑10 principle, the Sexual Scientific Process (with tracking and flow), and the tap keystroke—provide the scientific framework for your training. They ensure that every movement in the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke is deliberate, cumulative, and effective, turning your natural athletic ability into a finely tuned performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into its essential building blocks. This new stroke operates in two phases: first, you complete the entire sequence on the left side, then you mirror the exact same sequence on the right side. As a mesomorph with a penis between 5 and 7 inches, your naturally balanced physique allows you to execute dynamic, precise movements, while your compact extension demands focused, cumulative stimulation. Here’s your detailed blueprint:
Left‑Side Sequence:
Forward Movement: Begin by inserting your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle. Then, execute a smooth forward push by moving your entire body slowly northward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, the top shelf of your extension glides gently over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” According to the 80‑10‑10 principle, about 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow zone (the first 1–3 inches), ensuring intense stimulation in the most sensitive area.
Lateral Phase – Left Hip Drop: Immediately after the forward push, initiate the lateral phase on the left side. Slowly drop your left hip toward the canvas. As you do, the hilt of your penis applies targeted pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening. At the same time, your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, generating friction and a gentle rocking massage along her right wall—from the eastern section upward toward the northern section. This lateral drop is executed using the tap keystroke, ensuring controlled, minimal movement that keeps your applied force focused on the shallow zone.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Left‑Side Reversal): Immediately after dropping your left hip, raise it smoothly back to the center in a controlled motion. In this reversal, the hilt’s pressure shifts from the left side to a more central focus, so that it now applies force from the western section upward toward the northern section. Concurrently, your penis reorients to point directly north, delivering an upward massage from the northern wall to the eastern wall. This controlled raise is essential for integrating stimulation from the lateral phase and maintaining a rhythmic balance.
Cycle Repetition (Left Side): Repeat the left‑side sequence several times to build cumulative stimulation. You may introduce slight variations—for instance, executing a faster half‑raise before a full drop to intensify friction. These controlled modifications create a rhythmic “W” pattern on the left side, ensuring that every repetition remains true to the 80‑10‑10 principle by focusing the bulk of your force on the shallow zone.
Right‑Side Mirrored Sequence: After completing the full left‑side sequence, mirror the process on the right side:
Forward Movement (Repeat): Reset your position and perform another forward push, ensuring that the top shelf continues to glide over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant contact with her “south wall” under the same 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Lateral Phase – Right Hip Drop: Initiate the right‑side lateral phase by slowly dropping your right hip toward the canvas. In this mirrored movement, the hilt applies consistent pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left—producing a gentle rocking massage along her left wall (from the western section upward toward the northern section).
Hip Raise Back to Center (Right‑Side Reversal): Immediately raise your right hip back to center in a controlled fashion. Here, the hilt shifts its pressure from the right side to target the central, northern region, with your penis reorienting to point north, thus ensuring an upward massage from the northern wall to the western wall.
Cycle Repetition (Right Side): Repeat the right‑side sequence several times, mirroring the left‑side pattern exactly to deliver balanced, cumulative stimulation across both sides of the vaginal canal.
The complete Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke is achieved when the left‑side sequence is performed in full, followed immediately by the exact mirrored right‑side sequence. This dual‑phase approach ensures that every part of the vaginal canal is engaged with balanced, focused stimulation, and that the 80‑10‑10 principle is respected throughout.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement is as natural as your breath. With your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, precision and consistency are paramount. In this module, we’ll focus on repetitive, intensive practice of each segmented phase, ensuring every repetition adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Forward Movement Drill: Begin by assuming your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface—this base is essential for your balanced, muscular frame. Insert your penis at the precise downward diagonal angle, and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation as the top shelf of your extension glides over her clitoral region and the head maintains constant contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is moderately sized (between 5 and 7 inches), about 80% of your force must be directed to the shallow zone. Execute this forward push slowly and deliberately, repeating it several times until the movement is fluid, controlled, and consistent.
Left‑Side Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a small, controlled lateral movement until your hip gently taps the supporting surface. Visualize how the hilt applies targeted, steady pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right—delivering a gentle rocking massage on her right wall. Synchronize each lateral tap with deep, controlled breathing: inhale deeply before initiating the drop, and exhale slowly as you complete the tap. Incorporate kegeling exercises to further enhance control. Drill this left‑side movement repeatedly—aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions—until the motion becomes ingrained in your muscle memory.
Right‑Side Lateral Tap Drill (Mirrored Tap Keystroke): Then, mirror the drill on the right side. From your forward position, carefully drop your right hip until it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Visualize that the hilt applies consistent pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left, producing a gentle rocking massage on her left wall. Coordinate this movement with deep, deliberate breathing and incorporate kegeling for additional precision. Repeat for at least 30 repetitions on the right side until the movement is automatic.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: After perfecting the lateral taps, shift your focus to the lowering phase. Following each lateral tap, slowly lower your dropped hip until it contacts the supporting surface gently, allowing your penis’s underbelly to apply cumulative, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf maintains steady contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle—retract your body in a controlled manner so that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall as you reset your position without fully withdrawing. Repeat this complete sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times on both sides until every transition is seamless and each micro‑movement faithfully adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout your drills, maintain deep, deliberate breathing. Every deep inhale focuses your mind and primes your body for the next precise movement, while every controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions between phases. With disciplined, consistent practice, your athletic mesomorph precision and moderate extension will coalesce into a series of impeccably executed, cumulative movements that become second nature.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the essence of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your focus entirely on creating a fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this module, you will merge your forward push, left‑side lateral taps (via the tap keystroke), controlled left‑side hip raising, and backward shuttle, and then mirror those exact movements on the right side, to form the unified “W” pattern of the stroke.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward—moving steadily north toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extension continually glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push sets the stage and must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, focusing about 80% of your force on the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase on the left side. Execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip using the tap keystroke. Focus intently on how the hilt applies targeted pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right wall. After completing these left‑side taps, smoothly raise your left hip back to center to reset the pressure, then perform a deliberate backward shuttle to return to your starting position—ensuring your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall.
Next, mirror the process on the right side. From your starting position, execute another forward push (retaining the same 80‑10‑10 force distribution), then perform three controlled lateral taps by dropping your right hip until it gently taps the surface. Here, the hilt applies steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left—delivering a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her left wall. After these right‑side taps, raise your right hip back to center, and perform a controlled backward shuttle to reset.
This alternating “walking” motion—first left, then right—creates the rhythmic “W” pattern that defines the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke, ensuring balanced, cumulative stimulation across the entire vaginal canal, all while strictly honoring the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated sequence, let your deep, rhythmic breathing serve as your internal metronome—inhale deeply before each movement to prime your body, and exhale steadily to ensure smooth transitions. With every complete cycle, your athletic mesomorph precision and moderate extension come together into one continuous, fluid performance—a Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke that is both scientifically refined and intimately effective.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our goal is to fine‑tune every micro‑adjustment of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every micro‑movement must be executed with impeccable precision, ensuring that roughly 80% of your applied force targets the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, with the remaining force evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep regions.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, observe every nuance of your performance. During the forward push, verify that the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you execute your lateral taps using the tap keystroke on both sides, pay close attention to the subtle rocking motions produced by your controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even a slight variation—a one or two degree change in your hip drop angle or pace—can significantly alter the cumulative stimulation. Experiment with minor adjustments and carefully note how these changes affect the pressure distribution and rocking effect. Rely on your partner’s feedback—her deep, rhythmic breathing, soft verbal cues, and subtle body movements are essential data points for refining your technique. This iterative process—defining your goal, forming a hypothesis, tracking outcomes, and refining your movements—is at the core of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout each cycle. Every deep inhale should focus your energy for the next micro‑movement, while each controlled exhale facilitates smooth transitions between phases. Over time, as you consistently track your internal sensations (core engagement, pelvic floor contractions) along with your partner’s responses, you will naturally enter a state of flow—a seamless, automatic performance where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve this state, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will emerge as a continuous, rhythmic expression of scientifically optimized, cumulative stimulation.
Remember, brother, that every tiny adjustment matters. Your athletic mesomorph frame and moderate extension give you a perfect foundation for delivering intensely focused stimulation, but only when every micro‑movement is executed with consistency and precision. Continuously track your internal cues and your partner’s subtle feedback, and refine your technique until your stroke evolves into a naturally flowing performance that is both scientifically precise and intimately satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a structured training regimen designed specifically to reinforce every aspect of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke while strengthening your core and overall stability, which are essential for an athletic mesomorph with a penis between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your comprehensive roadmap for transforming your natural strength and precision into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically optimized stimulation.
Start by establishing a dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are minimized and your focus is solely on mastering your technique. Begin each session with an extensive warm‑up tailored to your mesomorph physiology. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back; these muscle groups provide the critical support needed for precise, controlled movements. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle for the detailed work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for your session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target each component of the stroke. Begin with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees securely planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint precision. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Synchronize every lateral movement with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale deeply before each shift and exhale slowly upon completion. To further sharpen your precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor with each lateral tap. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the movement becomes fully ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve perfected the lateral drills, integrate them with the vertical movements. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and then a smooth, gradual backward shuttle—ensuring every micro‑movement adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this full integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition flows naturally. Supplement your stroke‑specific drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises—such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills—since a strong core is essential for maintaining both balance and exact control. Finally, keep a detailed training journal where you record each session: the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you test, and your partner’s feedback. This journal is an essential part of the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to monitor progress and continually refine your technique.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module represents the culmination of your disciplined practice, where your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your mind entirely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extension consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, concentrating approximately 80% of your force on the shallow, sensitive vaginal zone while the remaining force is balanced between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase on one side by executing the tap keystroke with your right (or left) hip. Drop your hip in a small, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps, ensuring that the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening and that your penis rotates so its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. If any lateral tap seems inconsistent—due to uneven pressure or a slight misalignment—pause and isolate that movement. Drill it repeatedly until both your internal feedback and your partner’s subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced in accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you perform this pushout, focus on contracting your core and engaging your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for any subtle cues from your partner—her steady, deep breathing or gentle verbal responses are key indicators. If you observe that the cumulative stimulation isn’t optimal, make slight adjustments—perhaps a minor tweak in your lateral angle or a subtle change in the pace of your forward push—and meticulously track the outcomes using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the entire cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation across the vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you reach this state, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will stand as a testament to your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate finesse—a continuous, fluid performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated training into a true art form—a performance in which every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your athletic mesomorph strength and balanced extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure with every move. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke bring you ever closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
