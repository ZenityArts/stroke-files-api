Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Bata Coxa Stroke—tailored exclusively for endomorphs with a penis below 5 inches. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to guide you through this specialized training program. Your body, strong and full‑figured, is built for endurance and power. With your robust frame, you have an incredible natural stability that provides a formidable base for every movement. Although your extension is compact, every inch is highly sensitive, and when the technique is executed with precision, you can deliver intensely focused, cumulative stimulation. Today, we’ll convert your inherent power into a meticulously orchestrated performance that maximizes pleasure through deliberate, scientific movements.
Before we begin, please set aside a quiet, comfortable space that you can dedicate solely to your training—a true sanctuary for focused work. Sit or lie down, relax your broad, solid shoulders, and take several deep, slow breaths until your mind is clear and receptive. This session is all about transforming raw, heavy‑set power into controlled, rhythmic movements that create a balanced, cumulative effect in your partner’s vaginal canal.
We’ll start by modifying the classic missionary position to suit your endomorphic build. Begin in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. This foundational stance is essential for your robust body; it anchors you, ensuring that every micro‑movement is executed with deliberate control. Next, insert your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This precise insertion sets the blueprint for the stroke.
Your first action is a smooth, deliberate forward push—moving your entire body slowly northward toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, notice how the top shelf of your compact extension glides gently over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is below 5 inches, it is critical that you concentrate the majority of your force on the shallow, nerve‑rich area. We do this using the 80‑10‑10 principle: roughly 80% of your stimulation is directed at the first 1 to 3 inches, while the remaining 20% is split evenly between the mid‑depth (3–5 inches) and the deep zones (beyond 5 inches). This balanced distribution ensures intense stimulation in the most responsive area without diluting the overall effect.
After the forward push, the stroke moves into the lateral phase. Your inherent endomorphic stability gives you the strength to drop your left hip slowly and deliberately toward the canvas. As you do so, the hilt (or base) of your penis applies focused pressure along the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening. Meanwhile, your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right, creating friction and a gentle rocking massage along her right wall. Then, you raise your left hip back to center in a controlled reversal that resets the force distribution. The entire sequence—forward push, lateral drop, controlled raise, and reset—is repeated continuously. In this variation, known as the Douplo variation, you first complete the sequence on one side and then mirror it to the right, ensuring balanced, cumulative stimulation across the entire vaginal canal.
This introduction lays the foundation for converting your natural, heavy‑set power and compact extension into a scientifically precise, cumulative performance that maximizes stimulation exactly where it matters. Welcome, brother—let’s begin transforming your raw potential into an artful, intimate expression with the Bata Coxa Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re diving deep into the essential principles that guide every movement of the Bata Coxa Stroke. Understanding these core elements is key to executing the stroke with scientific precision and cumulative effect.
The 80‑10‑10 Principle This principle is our force distribution guideline. It requires you to direct approximately 80% of your applied force to the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches—which is rich in nerve endings and highly sensitive. The remaining 20% of your force is divided evenly, so that 10% goes to the mid‑depth (around 3–5 inches) and 10% to the deep (beyond 5 inches). For an endomorph with a compact extension, this means every movement must concentrate the bulk of the stimulation on that compact, sensitive area, while still maintaining a gentle, balanced engagement with the deeper tissues.
The Sexual Scientific Process This process is an iterative, systematic approach to refining your technique. It consists of four steps:
Define Your Goal: Clearly determine what you want to achieve with your stroke; for instance, maximize friction along a particular wall during the lateral drop.
Form a Hypothesis: Based on your initial practice and feedback, predict how slight adjustments—such as modifying your hip drop angle or pace—might enhance stimulation.
Track: Methodically perform a significant number of repetitions (ideally at least 30 strokes per vaginal “wall”), recording both your internal sensations (core engagement, pelvic floor activation) and your partner’s responses (her breathing, subtle movements, verbal cues).
Flow: Once you identify the most effective technique, commit to that rhythmic, automatic sequence, where every movement transitions seamlessly into the next without conscious effort.
Tracking is the focused gathering of data from your performance. As you execute the stroke, observe your partner’s reactions and your own internal cues. This information lets you make precise adjustments.
Flow is the state where your movements become natural and fluid. In flow, every forward push, lateral drop, and hip raise occurs seamlessly, ensuring that the 80‑10‑10 principle is maintained throughout, producing optimal cumulative stimulation.
The Tap Keystroke The tap keystroke is a foundational drill to refine your lateral control. It involves starting in a stable position (such as a forearm plank), shifting laterally until your hip gently “taps” the surface, and then returning smoothly to the center. This deliberate, minimal movement builds muscle memory and reinforces pelvic floor strength—especially when coordinated with deep breathing and kegeling exercises. Mastery of the tap keystroke ensures that every lateral movement in your stroke is executed with precise control and contributes effectively to cumulative stimulation.
Together, these principles—precise force distribution (80‑10‑10), the systematic refinement of the Sexual Scientific Process (including tracking and achieving flow), and the mastery of the tap keystroke—form the backbone of your training. They ensure that every micro‑movement is executed with deliberate focus, turning your raw, endomorphic power into a finely tuned, cumulative performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, it’s time to break down the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into its constituent components. This new stroke operates in two phases: first, a complete sequence on the left side, then the identical mirror image on the right side. As an ectomorph with a penis below 5 inches, every micro‑movement must be executed with precision to maximize the cumulative stimulation on that compact, sensitive area. Here’s your detailed blueprint.
Left‑Side Sequence:
Forward Movement: Begin by inserting your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Then, execute a smooth forward push—moving your entire body slowly northward toward her head. As you move forward, the top shelf of your compact extension glides over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” According to the 80‑10‑10 principle, about 80% of your force is directed to the shallow zone, ensuring the most sensitive area receives the concentrated stimulation.
Lateral Phase – Left Hip Drop: After the forward push, initiate the lateral phase on the left. Carefully drop your left hip toward the canvas. As you do so, the hilt of your penis applies focused pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, generating friction and producing an upward, gentle rocking massage along her right vaginal wall—from the eastern section up toward the northern section. This movement is executed using the tap keystroke, ensuring controlled, minimal lateral motion that keeps the majority of your applied force in the shallow zone.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Left‑Side Reversal): Immediately after dropping your left hip, raise it smoothly back to the center. This controlled reversal shifts the pressure from the left side to a neutral position, integrating the cumulative stimulation. The hilt now applies force from the western section upward to the northern section, while your penis reorients to point directly north, massaging upward from the northern to the eastern wall.
Cycle Repetition (Left Side): Repeat this drop-and-raise cycle several times. You may even introduce slight variations—such as a quicker half‑raise before completing a full drop—to modulate the friction and change the pressure pattern subtly. These controlled variations build a rhythmic “W” pattern on the left side, ensuring a dynamic cumulative effect.
Right‑Side Mirror Sequence: After you complete the left‑side sequence, mirror these movements on the right side:
Forward Movement (Repeat): Reset with another forward push, identical to the left‑side forward push, ensuring consistent adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Lateral Phase – Right Hip Drop: Now, drop your right hip in a controlled lateral shift until your hip gently taps the canvas. In this mirrored phase, the hilt of your penis applies steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, and your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left—producing an upward, gentle rocking massage along her left wall, from the western to the northern section.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Right‑Side Reversal): Raise your right hip back to center with the same controlled motion, shifting the force from the eastern section to the northern section, while your penis realigns to point straight north and continues to massage upward from the northern to the western wall.
Cycle Repetition (Right Side): Repeat the right‑side sequence multiple times to build balanced cumulative stimulation.
By deconstructing the stroke into these core phases—forward push, left‑side lateral drop and raise, then the mirrored right‑side sequence—you create a clear, methodical roadmap for your training. Each movement is executed with precision to adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force focuses on the shallow, highly sensitive area while the remaining force gently engages the deeper layers.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke until every movement becomes as natural as your breath. With your lean ectomorphic build and a penis below 5 inches, precision is paramount. In this module, we’ll focus on repetitive, intensive practice of every segmented phase to build seamless muscle memory.
Forward Movement Drill: Begin by assuming your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface to support your lean frame. Insert your penis at the precise downward diagonal angle, then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation as the top shelf of your compact extension glides over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is small, about 80% of your force must be focused on the shallow zone. Execute this forward push slowly and deliberately, repeating several times until the movement is smooth and consistent.
Left‑Side Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a controlled lateral shift until your hip gently taps the surface. Visualize the hilt applying targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right—creating a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right wall. Synchronize each lateral tap with deep, measured breathing; inhale deeply before initiating the drop, and exhale slowly as you complete the tap. Incorporate kegeling exercises with each tap to build added precision. Drill this lateral tap repeatedly—aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions—until the motion becomes ingrained.
Right‑Side Lateral Tap Drill (Mirrored Tap Keystroke): Then, mirror that drill on the right side. From your forward position, carefully drop your right hip until it taps the surface, and then return smoothly to the center. Visualize the hilt applying steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening as your penis rotates so its inner surface points to the left, delivering a gentle rocking massage on her left wall. Synchronize this movement with deep, deliberate breathing, and incorporate kegeling for extra control. Repeat for at least 30 repetitions until fully automatic.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: After perfecting the lateral taps, focus on the lowering phase. After each lateral tap, slowly lower your dropped hip until it gently contacts the supporting surface. Feel how the underbelly of your penis applies cumulative pressure against her lower wall while the upper shelf remains continuously in contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle—retract your body in a controlled manner so that your penis stays in constant contact with her north wall as you reset. Repeat the entire sequence (forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle) several times on both sides until every transition is seamless and every movement strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout your drilling, maintain deep, deliberate breathing. Every deep inhale prepares your mind and body for the next precise movement, and every controlled exhale smooths the transition between phases. With consistent, focused practice, your lean ectomorphic agility and compact extension will become naturally integrated into a series of movements executed with flawless precision and cumulative intensity.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the true art of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, your core engaged, and your mind solely focused on fluid integration. In this module, you’ll merge your forward push, the left‑side lateral taps (via the tap keystroke), controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle, then mirror those movements on the right side to complete the dual‑phase “W” pattern.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your body forward—moving steadily north toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your compact extension glides consistently over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push lays the foundation and must strictly follow the 80‑10‑10 principle by concentrating about 80% of your force on the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase on the left side. Execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip using the tap keystroke, ensuring that the hilt applies targeted pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening while your penis rotates so its inner surface points to the right, creating a gentle rocking massage on her right wall. Once these taps are completed, smoothly raise your left hip back to center to reset the pressure, then perform a slow, deliberate backward shuttle to return to your starting position—keeping your penis in constant contact with her north wall throughout.
Without delay, mirror the sequence on the right side. From your starting position, execute another forward push (with the same 80‑10‑10 distribution), then perform three controlled lateral taps by dropping your right hip until it taps the surface—this time, the hilt applies steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your penis rotates so its inner surface points to the left, resulting in a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along her left wall. After completing these right‑side taps, raise your right hip back to center, then execute a smooth backward shuttle to reset.
This alternating “walking” motion—the left‑side sequence followed by the mirror right‑side sequence—creates a rhythmic “W” pattern across the vaginal canal, ensuring balanced, cumulative stimulation on both sides. Each micro‑movement is executed with precision and in strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated performance, let your deep, rhythmic breathing serve as your internal metronome. Inhale deeply before each phase to prepare your body, and exhale steadily to ensure smooth transitions. With every complete cycle, your lean ectomorphic precision and compact extension work together to produce a continuous, fluid Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke that is both scientifically refined and intimately satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our goal is to fine‑tune every micro‑adjustment of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your lean ectomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every movement must be executed with impeccable precision to maintain the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that roughly 80% of your force targets the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone while the remaining 20% is evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, observe every nuance of your performance. During the forward push, verify that the top shelf of your compact extension consistently glides over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you perform your lateral taps using the tap keystroke on both sides, pay close attention to the natural, subtle rocking motion produced by your controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even the slightest variation in your lateral angle or pace can significantly alter the cumulative stimulation. Experiment with minor adjustments—a change of one or two degrees in your hip drop—and carefully note how these modifications affect the pressure distribution and the rocking effect. Use your partner’s feedback—her deep, rhythmic breathing, soft verbal cues, and subtle body movements—as critical data points. This iterative process of defining your goals, forming a hypothesis, tracking outcomes, and refining your technique is at the heart of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout every cycle. Every deep inhale should prepare your body for the next micro‑movement, while each controlled exhale facilitates smooth transitions between phases. Over time, as you consistently track your internal sensations (such as core engagement and pelvic floor contractions) and your partner’s responses, you will reach a state of flow—a seamless, automatic performance where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve this state of flow, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will become a continuous, rhythmic expression of optimized, cumulative stimulation that honors the 80‑10‑10 principle in every movement.
Remember, brother, that every tiny adjustment matters. Your lean, ectomorphic frame and compact extension provide an ideal platform for delivering intense, focused stimulation—but only if every micro‑movement is executed with perfect consistency and precision. By persistently tracking and refining your technique, you will evolve your stroke into a naturally flowing performance that is both scientifically precise and intimately satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to create your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen designed to reinforce every element of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke while also strengthening the core and overall stability essential for your lean ectomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your detailed roadmap for transforming your natural athletic precision into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically optimized stimulation.
First, establish your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are minimized and every movement is focused solely on perfecting your technique. Begin each session with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your ectomorphic physiology. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back; these support areas are crucial for executing every precise micro‑movement in the stroke. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, priming every muscle and joint for the work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for the session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target each component of the stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees securely planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to the center. Synchronize these movements with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale deeply before initiating each lateral shift and exhale slowly as you complete it. To further improve precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each tap. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the motion becomes ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve honed the lateral movement, integrate it with the vertical components. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and a smooth, gradual backward shuttle—ensuring that every micro‑movement adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this full integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition flows naturally. To enhance your stability and precision, supplement your stroke‑specific drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills—these are critical for maintaining balance and exact control during your performance. Finally, keep a detailed training journal where you record every session: note the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you experiment with, and the feedback you receive from your partner. This journal is an indispensable tool within the Sexual Scientific Process, allowing you to monitor progress and continuously refine your technique.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically optimized, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module represents the culmination of your dedicated practice, where your lean, ectomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, core engaged, and your mind entirely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extension consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with approximately 80% of your force concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone.
Immediately, transition into the lateral phase. Execute the tap keystroke with your right hip first, dropping it in a controlled, deliberate lateral shift and performing three precise lateral taps—ensuring that the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along the corresponding side of her vaginal opening while your penis rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. If any lateral tap appears inconsistent—whether due to uneven pressure or a slight misalignment—pause and isolate that movement; drill it repeatedly until your internal feedback and your partner’s cues confirm that the force distribution is balanced according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while enabling you to gather precise internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, pay close attention to the contraction of your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for any subtle verbal or nonverbal cues from your partner. This troubleshooting phase is critical; if the cumulative stimulation isn’t optimal, make minor adjustments—perhaps a subtle tweak in your lateral angle or a slight variation in the pace of your forward push—and meticulously track the outcomes following the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one unified, rhythmic performance. Then mirror the complete cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation across the entire vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you reach that state, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will stand as a testament to your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate finesse—a continuously flowing performance that is scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your achievement, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements turn your dedicated practice into an art form—a performance in which every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your athletic mesomorph strength and balanced extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure with every move. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke bring you ever closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
