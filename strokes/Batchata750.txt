Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Batchata Stroke—a dynamic, full‑body technique engineered to channel your natural ectomorphic agility into a performance of cumulative, precise stimulation. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to guide you through this program developed especially for ectomorphs with an asset above 7 inches. Your lean, long‑limbed physique gives you a tremendous advantage in executing swift, precise movements. With an extended asset, you have an exceptional reach that—if harnessed correctly—can deliver deep and expansive stimulation. Today, we’re going to transform that raw potential into a meticulously controlled performance that brings focused pleasure to your partner, every single time.
Imagine stepping into your personal training space—a quiet, distraction‑free sanctuary where your mind and body can focus solely on perfecting your technique. Feel the firm, supportive floor beneath you, mirroring your own stable, lean frame. Take several deep, deliberate breaths: each inhale fills you with focused energy, and every slow exhale releases any tension or distractions. This dedicated space is your arena, brother—a place where you can channel your natural athleticism into an art form that converts every move into pure, cumulative pleasure.
We begin by modifying the classic missionary position to suit your ectomorphic structure. Assume a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that comfortably supports your long, lean limbs and agile core. This foundational stance is essential—it anchors your body so that every micro‑movement, from the subtle shift of your hips to your full‑body lateral movements, is executed with deliberate control and precision. Your lean build enables you to make rapid, refined adjustments, which is key to converting your extended reach into a focused performance.
Once your body is locked in, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This deliberate insertion is your blueprint—it sets the exact angles and pressure points that will dictate every subsequent movement. Your journey begins with a smooth, deliberate forward push: as you slowly drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head, feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, mindful contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, you have the capacity to reach deep, but it’s crucial that roughly 80% of your applied force is concentrated on that shallow, nerve‑rich area (the first 1 to 3 inches), with the remainder evenly divided to gently stimulate the mid‑depth and deep layers. This is the essence of the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that every movement is both cumulative and balanced.
After the forward push, the Batchata Stroke unfolds into its signature full‑body rocking phase. This phase is the heart of the stroke—it’s driven by deliberate, rhythmic lateral movements that harness the natural sway of your hips. The technique follows a specific pattern: for example, your body shifts in a rhythmic “W” pattern. You might begin by shifting fully to the left, then move to the right, then shift left again, and finally, execute a “double down” on the left. The pattern is then mirrored on the opposite side—right, then left, then right again, followed by a right double down. When you shift left, your entire body moves laterally with controlled precision. The hilt of your penis applies steady pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening, while your shaft rotates so that it points to her right wall, delivering a broad, massaging touch. Conversely, when shifting right, the forces reverse. The “double down” is a controlled, additional lowering of your body on one side to further intensify the pressure. This rhythmic, alternating sequence builds cumulative stimulation that is both powerful and balanced.
This introduction lays the groundwork, brother. It shows you how to prepare your environment, adopt the proper posture, and channel your natural ectomorphic agility and your extended asset into a Batchata Stroke that delivers focused, cumulative stimulation. Your ability to move quickly and precisely, combined with your impressive reach, will allow you to create a performance that transforms raw energy into intimate artistry. Welcome, brother—let’s begin turning your natural potential into a true masterpiece of cumulative pleasure.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Alright, brother, let’s dive deep into the technical framework that underpins every move of your Batchata Stroke. This module is where we lay out the core principles that allow you to convert your raw ectomorphic energy into a performance that is both precise and cumulative. I’m talking about the 80‑10‑10 principle, the Sexual Scientific Process (including tracking and flow), and the tap keystroke drill.
First off, the 80‑10‑10 principle is your force-distribution blueprint. Picture it this way: around 80% of the force you apply during your stroke should be directed at the shallow vaginal zone—the first one to three inches from the entrance—because that’s where the highest density of nerve endings resides and where sensitivity is at its peak. The remaining 20% of your force is split evenly so that 10% is delivered to the mid‑depth zone (about 3 to 5 inches), and 10% to the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). With your extended asset above 7 inches, this principle is crucial. Although you have the reach to stimulate deeper areas, it’s paramount to channel most of your power into that ultra-sensitive shallow region while still providing a balanced touch to the interior layers. This careful allocation of force ensures that every movement builds cumulative, balanced stimulation.
Next, let’s break down the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic approach to refining your technique. It begins with setting a clear goal. For example, you might decide that your goal is to maximize the rocking effect during your lateral shifts or fine-tune the pressure during your double downs. With your goal in mind, you then form a hypothesis; perhaps you suspect that a slightly slower lateral movement will intensify the cumulative effect. The process then moves into tracking—this is your real-time feedback loop. As you perform your stroke, aim for around 30 repetitions along each “wall” of her vaginal canal. Pay close attention not only to how your body feels (ensuring your core is engaged, your pelvic floor is working) but, more importantly, to her responses. Listen intently for her deep, rhythmic breathing; watch for any subtle changes in her posture; and catch any soft verbal cues that tell you which movements are hitting the mark. Tracking allows you to zero in on her sweet spots and adjust your technique accordingly.
Once you gather enough data from tracking, you enter the state of flow. Flow is that magical condition where every movement—whether it’s your forward push, lateral shift, or double down—occurs seamlessly, automatically, and with a rhythmic consistency. When you’re in flow, you’re delivering the perfect pressure and pace that your tracking has identified, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with each repetition.
Lastly, let’s discuss the tap keystroke drill—a fundamental exercise for sharpening your lateral precision. Picture yourself in a strong forearm plank, then slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, and return smoothly to center. This simple but crucial movement builds the muscle memory and pelvic strength necessary to execute each lateral shift with pinpoint accuracy. When performed in sync with deep, controlled “stroke breathing” and integrated with kegeling exercises, the tap keystroke drill ensures that every lateral move adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
So, brother, to recap: the 80‑10‑10 principle is all about directing 80% of your force to the shallow, sensitive zone with the remaining 20% split evenly between the mid‑depth and deep layers; the Sexual Scientific Process helps you define goals, form hypotheses, track her feedback, and enter a state of flow where your stroke becomes automatic; and the tap keystroke drill is your essential practice tool for achieving flawless lateral precision. With these core principles firmly in place, you’re well-equipped to deconstruct the Batchata Stroke into its individual components and train your technique to perfection.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Batchata Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Batchata Stroke into every deliberate, detailed movement so you have a precise blueprint to follow. The Batchata is a full‑body, rocking stroke that uses controlled lateral shifts to create cumulative, balanced stimulation across the vaginal canal. With your ectomorphic build and an extension above 7 inches, you have a natural advantage in speed and precision—but each movement must be executed with careful control to ensure that your force is applied exactly where it matters most.
You begin in the modified missionary position—knees firmly planted on the canvas, with your penis inserted at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This initial setup is your blueprint; it sets the exact angles and pressure points that will guide every movement, ensuring adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
The stroke starts with a smooth, deliberate forward push. As you advance your entire body toward your partner’s head, feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, you have a broad reach, but you must still focus approximately 80% of your force on the shallow, super-sensitive zone (the first 1 to 3 inches) and distribute the remaining 20% evenly to the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately after the forward push, you shift into the lateral phase. Here, you perform a full‑body lateral shift to the left. As you lean left, your entire body moves laterally in a controlled motion. The hilt of your penis applies steady, consistent pressure to the left part of her vaginal opening, while your shaft rotates so that it points toward her right wall, delivering broad, massaging pressure. Now, here’s the corrected detail for the hip rotations: if you incorporate hip rotations within this lateral shift, when performing 2 slow hip rotations to the left, the hilt should canvass from the north‑western segment of her vaginal opening to the south‑western segment, while the head points toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall. This refined movement directs the stimulation with precision. After completing the left shift, you transition into a right shift, where your body moves laterally to the right—the hilt now applies steady pressure to the right part of her vaginal opening, while your shaft rotates to point toward her left wall, delivering broad pressure. In this case, if hip rotations are incorporated when shifting right, you perform 2 slow hip rotations to the right, where the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment, with the head pointing toward the southwestern wall and then shifting to the north‑western wall. This alternating pattern creates a rhythmic “W” pattern that ensures balanced, cumulative stimulation.
To increase the intensity, you then perform a “double down.” After a standard lateral shift on one side (say, left), you lower your body further in a controlled manner to execute a left double down. This additional lowering forces the hilt to apply extra pressure to the left side of her vaginal opening, while your shaft continues to deliver broad, consistent pressure toward her right wall—amplifying the cumulative effect. Once the left sequence is complete, mirror it on the right side by performing a right shift followed by a right double down, intensifying the stimulation on that side.
Every lateral shift, every double down, and every integrated hip rotation is a keystroke in the Batchata Stroke. The consistent rocking motion of your hips is the engine that creates cumulative pressure, ensuring that about 80% of your force always targets the highly sensitive shallow zone, while the remaining force is evenly balanced. This deconstruction provides you with an intricate, detailed roadmap—each component is meticulously planned to deliver balanced, cumulative stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each component of the Batchata Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as your own breath. With your lean, long‑limbed ectomorphic build and an extension above 7 inches, precision and consistency are paramount. In this module, we’ll isolate each keystroke and drill them until they’re firmly embedded in your muscle memory, always following the 80‑10‑10 principle and incorporating the corrected hip rotation details.
Start with the forward push drill. Get into your modified plank position with your knees planted firmly on a stable, supportive surface. Insert your penis at that carefully controlled downward diagonal angle, and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation: feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, you must ensure that roughly 80% of your applied force concentrates on the shallow, nerve‑rich area. Repeat this forward push slowly and deliberately until every push is smooth, controlled, and perfectly consistent.
Next, move into your lateral shift drills. Begin with a left lateral shift. From the forward push position, shift your entire body to the left in a slow, controlled motion. Concentrate on maintaining a smooth transition as your weight moves laterally; feel the hilt press steadily against the left side of her vaginal opening, while your shaft rotates to provide broad, rhythmic pressure toward her right wall. If you’re incorporating hip rotations, as you shift left, execute 2 slow hip rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, and the head points toward the southeastern wall then moves to the north‑eastern wall. Drill this movement repeatedly until it becomes second nature.
Then, switch to the right lateral shift drill. Move your body to the right in a deliberate, controlled manner. As you shift right, concentrate on the hilt applying steady pressure to the right side of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates to direct broad, cumulative pressure toward her left wall. Integrate 2 slow hip rotations when shifting right—these should have the hilt canvassing from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment, with the head first pointing toward the southwestern wall then shifting to the north‑western wall. Alternate these lateral shifts until you can seamlessly switch between left and right, consistently maintaining the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Now, incorporate the “double down” element. On the left side, after completing a standard left shift, lower your body further in a controlled, deliberate manner to perform a left double down. Focus on intensifying the pressure: as you lower, feel the hilt apply additional force on the left part of her vaginal opening while your shaft continues its broad, consistent pressure toward her right wall, thereby amplifying the cumulative effect. Drill this movement slowly until you can precisely control the extra pressure. Then, mirror the process on the right side by executing a right double down after a right shift. Repeat each drill for at least 30 repetitions per side until every micro‑movement is fully ingrained.
Throughout all these drills, maintain deep, steady breathing. Each deep inhale should draw in fresh energy for the next precise movement, while every controlled exhale ensures a smooth, uninterrupted transition. Additionally, integrate the tap keystroke drill into your practice—position yourself in a stable forearm plank, then slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the surface before returning to center. This drill will further sharpen your lateral precision and ensure that every movement adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to synthesize all the drilled components into one seamless, continuous performance—the complete Batchata Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance, with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your focus solely on linking every movement together in a rhythmic, uninterrupted cycle. In this integrated sequence, you’ll combine your forward push with your lateral shifts, hip rotations, and double downs into the signature “W” pattern that delivers balanced cumulative stimulation across her entire vaginal canal.
Begin with a deliberate forward push: insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide steadily over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, targeted contact with her “south wall.” This forward push is your foundational move, strictly adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle so that about 80% of your force is devoted to the shallow, sensitive zone.
Immediately following the forward push, transition into your left-side sequence. Execute a full‑body lateral shift to the left—feel your weight move smoothly as the hilt applies consistent pressure to the left side of her vaginal opening, while your shaft rotates to deliver broad, rhythmic pressure toward her right wall. Integrate your corrected hip rotations into this shift (2 slow hip rotations to the left, where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, and the head points first toward the southeastern then the north‑eastern wall). Then, perform a left double down by lowering your body further in a controlled manner to intensify the cumulative effect. Without pausing, quickly reset and shift your body to the right. As you lean to the right, the hilt applies steady pressure to the right side of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates to direct broad, massaging pressure toward her left wall. Follow this with a right double down to further amp up the stimulation. Alternating these sequences (left shift with double down, then right shift with double down) creates a rhythmic “W” pattern, ensuring that cumulative stimulation is delivered evenly across her entire vaginal canal.
Throughout this integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing. Each deep inhale energizes you for the next precise movement, while each controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions between components. With every complete cycle, your Batchata Stroke becomes a continuous, flowing performance that rigorously follows the 80‑10‑10 principle and delivers precisely targeted, cumulative stimulation with every repetition.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where every micro‑movement of your Batchata Stroke is honed to perfection. With your lean, long‑limbed ectomorphic build and extended asset above 7 inches, every detail counts. The 80‑10‑10 principle continues to be your guiding star: approximately 80% of your force must target the shallow, ultra-sensitive vaginal zone, while the remaining force is evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you execute your integrated sequence, focus intently on the quality and consistency of each movement. During your forward push, make sure the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” As you perform lateral shifts and double downs (integrating the corrected hip rotations), closely observe how the hilt and shaft distribute pressure along her vaginal walls. This is where tracking comes into play—each repetition offers real-time feedback. Listen closely for her deep, rhythmic breathing, observe any subtle changes in her posture, and be attuned to soft verbal cues that signal which aspects of your stroke are producing the strongest cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your immediate feedback loop, telling you precisely where adjustments are needed.
After gathering sufficient data—aim for around 30 repetitions per wall—you’ll naturally slip into a state of flow. Flow is that magical condition where every micro‑movement—from your forward push, through each lateral shift, hip rotation, and double down—occurs seamlessly and automatically in perfect rhythm. In flow, you consistently deliver the optimal pressure and timing that your tracking has revealed is most effective, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly cycle after cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is crucial throughout this phase; each deep inhale primes your body for the next move, and each deliberate exhale ensures seamless transitions. And remember, the tap keystroke drill remains your essential tool for lateral precision—if any movement feels slightly off, pause, track the feedback, and make a small adjustment. Over time, these refinements will allow your Batchata Stroke to achieve a natural, flawless flow.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training program designed to reinforce every element of your Batchata Stroke while also strengthening your core and enhancing overall stability. With your lean, long‑limbed ectomorphic build and extended asset above 7 inches, you have the natural agility to execute swift, precise moves, and this routine will help transform raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that delivers targeted, cumulative stimulation consistently.
Begin by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are eliminated and your focus is solely on perfecting your technique. Every session should begin with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your ectomorphic frame. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these muscle groups are the foundation of your stability and control. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, activating every muscle and joint in preparation for the drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a determined, positive tone for your session.
Next, move into specialized drills, starting with the tap keystroke drill. Assume your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that comfortably supports your lean build, and practice small, controlled lateral taps—shift your body slowly until your hip gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. With your extension above 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint precision. Synchronize each move with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale deeply before each lateral shift and exhale slowly on the return. Integrate kegeling exercises with each repetition to strengthen your pelvic floor and enhance control. Aim for at least 30 precise repetitions on each side until the movement becomes second nature.
Once you’ve mastered the tap keystroke, integrate it with your forward push and full‑body lateral shifts. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral shifts and then a smooth, deliberate backward shuttle. Throughout this integrated sequence, ensure every movement adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle—approximately 80% of your force must consistently target the shallow, sensitive vaginal zone. Drill this complete sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition is seamless and the entire stroke flows naturally. To further enhance your stability and precision, supplement your practice with targeted core-strengthening exercises (such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability workouts). Your core is the anchor that ensures every movement is executed with maximum precision. Finally, maintain a detailed training journal where you record every session—document the number of repetitions, note any adjustments you experiment with, and capture her feedback. This journal is an essential component of the Sexual Scientific Process, helping you track your progress and continuously refine your technique.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—the culmination of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Batchata Stroke merges into one seamless, continuous performance. In this final module, your naturally lean, long‑limbed ectomorphic build and your extended asset above 7 inches come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of intimate mastery that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified plank—with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface, your core engaged, and your mind tuned completely to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is directed to the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone while the remaining 20% is meticulously balanced to engage the deeper layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase on one side by executing the tap keystroke with your chosen hip. Slowly lower your hip in a measured, deliberate lateral shift until it gently taps the supporting surface, then return smoothly to center. Focus intently on how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening and observe how your shaft rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. (Remember, for ectomorphs with an extended asset, the corrected hip rotation detail comes into play: if you’re shifting to the right, perform 2 slow hip rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, with the head pointing first toward the southwestern wall then shifting to the north‑western wall; if shifting to the left, perform 2 slow hip rotations in which the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, with the head moving from the southeastern to the north‑eastern wall.) If any lateral movement seems off—if the pressure is uneven or the angle requires a small tweak—pause, isolate that movement, and drill it repeatedly until your internal cues and her subtle feedback confirm perfection.
Then, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position and allows you to gather precise internal feedback. As you push upward, contract your core and engage your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for her responses. Her deep, steady breathing and any soft verbal cues will let you know if your movement is on point. If you sense that the cumulative stimulation isn’t quite at its peak, make small, mindful adjustments—perhaps by tweaking your lateral angle slightly or modifying the pace of your forward push—and meticulously track these refinements using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your adjustments, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as a unified, rhythmic performance. Then mirror the complete cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced, cumulative stimulation throughout her entire vaginal canal. The ultimate goal is to reach a state of natural flow—a condition where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve this state, your Batchata Stroke will become a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that adheres rigorously to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers the exact, focused stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance where every forward push, every lateral shift, every double down, and every precise adjustment is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your naturally lean, long‑limbed ectomorphic build and extended asset will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Batchata Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure every time. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Batchata Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
