Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Bata Coxa Stroke! I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m excited to work with you—an athletic mesomorph with a penis between 5 and 7 inches. Your body naturally combines strength, agility, and balance, providing you with exceptional control and speed. Even though your extension is moderate, every inch is highly sensitive and, when trained with precision, can deliver cumulative stimulation that will elevate your intimate performance.
Before we get started, please find a quiet, comfortable space where you can focus entirely on this training session. Sit back or lie down, relax those well‑defined shoulders, and take several deep, steady breaths to clear your mind. Today, we’re going to convert your natural athletic prowess into a meticulously choreographed sequence of movements that will transform raw energy into an artful, scientifically optimized performance.
We start by modifying the classic missionary position to best suit your mesomorph frame. Begin in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface; this is critical for your balanced, muscular build, ensuring that every movement is executed with controlled precision. Then, insert your penis at a carefully calculated downward diagonal angle into your partner. This insertion angle is your foundational blueprint for the stroke.
From the moment you insert, your first action is a smooth, deliberate forward push—moving your entire body slowly northward toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, the top shelf of your moderate extension glides gently across her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension falls between 5 and 7 inches, it is crucial that you concentrate approximately 80% of your force on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone (roughly the first 1–3 inches), while the remaining 20% is split evenly between the mid‑depth and deep zones. This 80‑10‑10 distribution is the key to maximizing stimulation precisely where it counts without overwhelming any area.
After the forward push, the stroke transitions into the lateral phase. Thanks to your athletic mesomorph structure, you have excellent agility that allows you to perform swift, precise lateral movements. In this phase, you focus on controlled lateral shifts using your left hip. You gently drop your left hip toward the canvas so that the hilt (base) of your penis applies consistent, targeted pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening. As you do this, your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right, creating friction and generating a gentle rocking massage along her right wall. Following this lateral drop, you then raise your left hip back toward the center to reset the pressure. This drop-and-raise cycle forms the core “W” pattern of the Bata Coxa Stroke—a rhythmic sequence that builds cumulative stimulation with every repetition.
In summary, today’s introduction lays the foundation for turning your naturally balanced mesomorph strength and moderate extension into a precisely executed, cumulative performance. Every forward push, lateral shift, and return is driven by both the principles of scientific technique and your own natural athleticism. Welcome, brother—let’s begin transforming your raw potential into an artful display of intimate mastery with the Bata Coxa Stroke!
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re going to delve into the core principles that underpin the Bata Coxa Stroke and ensure that each movement you execute is both scientifically precise and intimately effective.
The 80‑10‑10 principle is the foundation of our approach. It instructs you to concentrate about 80% of your applied force on the shallow vaginal zone—roughly the first 1 to 3 inches—because this area is densely packed with nerve endings and is the most sensitive. The remaining 20% of your force is divided equally between the mid‑depth (approximately 3–5 inches) and the deep (beyond 5 inches) zones. For a mesomorph with a moderate extension, this ensures that while you have the reach to engage deeper areas, the majority of the stimulation is reserved for the most sensitive section, achieving a balanced yet intensely focused performance.
Next, the Sexual Scientific Process is a systematic, iterative method for refining your technique. It consists of four steps:
Define Your Goal: Clearly articulate what you wish to achieve with your stroke. For example, you might aim to maximize friction along a particular vaginal wall during your lateral drop.
Form a Hypothesis: Based on your observations, predict which slight adjustments (like modifying your hip drop angle or pace) might improve the stimulation.
Track: Methodically perform numerous repetitions—ideally 30 strokes per “wall”—while carefully recording both your internal sensations (such as your core engagement and pelvic floor activity) and your partner’s responses (her breathing, subtle movements, or verbal cues).
Flow: Once you identify the stroke variation that consistently yields optimal results, commit to that rhythmic, automatic sequence so that every movement transitions seamlessly into the next without conscious thought.
Tracking is the ongoing process of gathering feedback. As you execute the stroke, pay close attention to your partner’s responses and how each variation in your movement affects the experience. This systematic observation allows you to determine what adjustments are needed to maintain the correct distribution of force.
Flow is achieved when your movements become instinctive and continuous—a state where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle happens seamlessly, with perfect adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle. When you’re in flow, your stroke becomes a natural, rhythmic expression of cumulative stimulation.
The Tap Keystroke is a foundational drill used to perfect your lateral movements. In practice, it involves beginning in a stable position (such as a forearm plank), shifting laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, and then returning smoothly to the center. This controlled, minimal movement builds the necessary muscle memory and pelvic floor strength to execute each lateral drop with precision. Synchronizing this drill with deep, measured breathing and kegeling further refines your technique and helps ensure that each lateral movement contributes effectively to the cumulative effect.
Together, these principles form the scientific and technical backbone of your training. They ensure that every component of the Bata Coxa Stroke is executed with deliberate focus and precision, converting your natural athletic ability into a finely tuned, cumulative performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Bata Coxa Stroke into its essential components. Picture yourself in the missionary position—on top in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. As an athletic mesomorph with a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every micro‑movement is pivotal in building cumulative, focused stimulation. We’re going to isolate each phase so you have a clear blueprint for executing the stroke with precision.
Forward Movement: The stroke begins with the careful insertion of your penis at a downward diagonal angle into your partner. Once inserted, initiate a slow, controlled forward push—moving your entire body northward toward her head. During this phase, the top shelf of your moderate extension glides gently over her clitoral region while the head stays in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push is foundational; it primes the sensitive area by ensuring that about 80% of your force is directed at the shallow vaginal zone (roughly the first 1–3 inches) in strict accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle. Because your extension is neither too short nor too long, every inch of forward movement must be executed with precise control to maximize stimulation without causing over‑penetration.
Lateral Phase (Left Hip Drop): After the forward push, you transition into the lateral phase. From your forward position, execute a controlled lateral shift by dropping your left hip toward the canvas. Here, the hilt of your penis applies steady, focused pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening. At the same time, as your left hip drops, your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right, creating friction and generating a gentle rocking massage along her right wall. This lateral drop is performed using the tap keystroke—a deliberate, small lateral movement designed to maintain the precise distribution of force so that most of the stimulation remains in the shallow zone. It’s crucial that this movement is controlled, as even slight deviations can alter the cumulative effect.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Reversal): Immediately after the lateral drop, raise your left hip back toward the center. In this reversal, the hilt of your penis shifts its pressure from the western region of her vaginal opening to the northern region, while your penis reorients to point directly north. This produces a gentle upward massage along the northern wall toward the eastern wall. This reversal integrates the stimulation from the lateral drop, maintaining a steady rhythmic flow and the balanced 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Cycle Repetition and Variations in Pace: The stroke then continues as you repeat the drop-and-raise cycle. You might vary the pace by raising your left hip only halfway toward the center at a faster rate to intensify the friction—this creates a subtle variation in the pressure pattern that further enhances cumulative stimulation. You then perform another full drop to reapply the targeted pressure, and finally complete the cycle with a full, controlled raise back to center to reset the sequence. This alternating, rhythmic “W” pattern ensures that every micro‑movement builds cumulative intensity and that the stimulation is evenly distributed throughout the cycle.
By deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into these distinct phases—forward push, lateral drop via the tap keystroke, controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle—you obtain a clear, methodical roadmap that allows every movement to be executed with precision. Each phase adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that about 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, most sensitive area, while the remaining force gently engages the mid‑depth and deep zones. This detailed breakdown is your blueprint for converting your natural athletic ability into a refined, cumulative performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each component of the Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as your breath. With your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, precision and consistency are key. In this module, we’ll focus on repetitive, intensive practice of each segmented phase—starting with the forward push, then isolating the lateral drop using the tap keystroke, followed by controlled hip lowering, and finally the backward shuttle—ensuring that every repetition is executed perfectly according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Forward Movement Drill: Begin by assuming your modified plank position with your knees securely planted on a stable surface; this supports your balanced, muscular frame. Insert your penis at the precise downward diagonal angle, and then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Concentrate on the sensation as the top shelf of your moderate extension glides over her clitoral area, and make sure the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is moderate, it is imperative that about 80% of your applied force targets the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. Execute this forward push with deliberate control, and repeat it several times until you can replicate the same smooth, consistent movement with unwavering precision.
Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): Next, isolate the lateral component by practicing the tap keystroke. From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a small, controlled lateral motion until your hip gently taps the supporting surface. Visualize how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Each lateral tap should be synchronized with deep, controlled breathing: inhale deeply before initiating the drop, and exhale slowly as you complete the tap. For enhanced precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor with every lateral tap. Drill this movement repeatedly—aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side—until the tap keystroke becomes an ingrained, automatic part of your muscle memory.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: After perfecting the lateral tap, shift your focus to the lowering phase. Following each lateral tap, slowly lower your dropped hip until it gently makes contact with the support. Concentrate on the sensation: feel the underbelly of your penis begin to apply controlled, cumulative pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf maintains steady contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle—retract your body in a controlled manner so that your penis remains in constant contact with her north wall as you reset your position without fully withdrawing. Repeat the entire sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times until every transition flows seamlessly and every micro‑movement adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout your drilling, maintain deep, deliberate breathing. Each deep inhale should focus your concentration and prepare your body for the next micro‑movement, while every controlled exhale facilitates smooth, natural transitions between phases. With persistent, disciplined practice, your athletic mesomorph agility combined with your balanced extension will merge into a series of movements executed with unwavering precision and cumulative effectiveness.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—that is when the art of the Bata Coxa Stroke truly comes to life. Return to your starting position in your modified plank—your knees firmly planted, your core fully engaged, and your mind entirely focused on creating a fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this module, you will merge your forward push, lateral taps executed through the tap keystroke, controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle into one unified, rhythmic cycle that forms the distinctive “W” pattern of the stroke.
Start with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the precise downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward—moving steadily north toward your partner’s head. As you do so, ensure that the top shelf of your moderate extension consistently glides over her clitoral region, and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push establishes the baseline for cumulative stimulation and must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with about 80% of your force directed into the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase. Execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip using the tap keystroke. As you perform each lateral tap, focus on how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle rocking massage on her right internal wall. After completing these taps, gradually lower your dropped hip so that the underbelly of your penis applies a steady, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf maintains constant contact with her upper wall. Then execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle until you return to your starting position, ensuring your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall.
Once one full cycle is completed on one side, reset and mirror the entire sequence on the opposite side. Now, raise your right hip laterally and perform three deliberate lateral taps—ensuring that the right side of your penis engages the left vaginal opening while the left side delivers a complementary, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Lower your hip in a controlled manner and then shuttle backward until you return to your starting position. This alternating “walking” motion forms the rhythmic “W” pattern that is the hallmark of the Bata Coxa Stroke, ensuring balanced, cumulative stimulation that strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated routine, allow your deep, rhythmic breathing to serve as your internal metronome: each deep inhale primes you for the next micro‑movement, and each controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions between phases. With every complete cycle, your athletic mesomorph precision and balanced extension come together in a continuous, fluid performance—a Bata Coxa Stroke that is both scientifically refined and intimately effective.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our focus is to fine‑tune every micro‑adjustment of your Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every micro‑movement must be executed with impeccable precision to honor the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that roughly 80% of your applied force is directed to the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep areas.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, pay close attention to the nuances of your movement. During the forward push, confirm that the top shelf of your moderate extension consistently glides over her clitoral region while the head maintains continuous, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, while executing your lateral taps using the tap keystroke, observe the subtle rocking motion generated by your controlled, precise lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even the slightest deviation in your lateral angle can significantly alter the cumulative stimulation. Experiment with minor adjustments—a one or two degree change in your hip drop—then carefully track how these changes affect the overall pressure distribution and rocking effect. Rely on your partner’s feedback—her steady, deep breathing, gentle verbal cues, and subtle physical shifts are essential data points. This iterative process—defining your goal, forming a hypothesis, tracking outcomes, and refining your technique—is at the core of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Throughout every cycle, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing; each deep inhale should focus your energy and prime you for the next movement, while each controlled exhale ensures smooth, natural transitions. Over time, with persistent tracking and continuous adjustments based on both your internal signals (like core engagement and pelvic floor activity) and your partner’s responses, you will enter a state of flow—a seamless, automatic performance where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed flawlessly. When you achieve this flow state, your Bata Coxa Stroke will be a continuously rhythmic, cumulative expression of scientifically optimized, intimate stimulation.
Remember, brother, every tiny adjustment matters. Your athletic mesomorph structure and balanced extension provide you with the ideal platform to deliver focused stimulation; however, it is your attention to those micro‑details that elevates your performance. Consistently track your internal cues and your partner’s subtle feedback, and refine your technique accordingly, until your stroke is as automatic and effective as possible.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen designed specifically to reinforce every element of the Bata Coxa Stroke while simultaneously strengthening the core and overall stability essential for your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your comprehensive blueprint for transforming your natural strength and precision into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically calibrated stimulation.
Begin by establishing your own dedicated training space—a quiet, private area where distractions are eliminated and every movement is focused solely on mastering your technique. Every training session should start with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically for your athletic mesomorph physique. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back—these are the key support areas that allow you to execute every micro‑movement in the Bata Coxa Stroke with precision. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, priming every muscle fiber for the meticulous work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for your session.
Next, dive into specialized drills targeting each component of the stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees firmly planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis size between 5 and 7 inches, each lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Synchronize every lateral tap with deliberate, deep breathing—inhaling deeply before initiating the lateral shift and exhaling slowly as you complete it. To further enhance your precision, incorporate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each lateral movement. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke is completely ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve refined the lateral tap, integrate it with the vertical components. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and then a smooth, gradual backward shuttle—ensuring that every micro‑movement strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition flows naturally and your cumulative stimulation is optimized. To further bolster your stability and precision, supplement your stroke‑specific drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills—these are critical for maintaining balance and ensuring that every movement of the Bata Coxa Stroke is executed with optimal control. Keep a detailed training journal to record every session—document the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you make, and feedback from your partner. This journal is an indispensable tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, helping you track progress and continually refine your technique.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural athletic mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance, and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of your disciplined practice, where your athletic mesomorph build and your penis between 5 and 7 inches converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank, with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core engaged, and your mind entirely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your penis consistently caresses her clitoral region and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle—approximately 80% of your force is delivered to the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is carefully divided to stimulate the mid‑depth and deep areas.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your right hip. Raise your hip in a small, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps. With each tap, focus intently on how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface produces a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. If any lateral tap appears inconsistent—whether due to uneven pressure or a slight misalignment—pause and isolate that movement, then drill it repeatedly until your internal feedback and your partner’s subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced in line with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, pay close attention to the contraction in your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for any subtle cues from your partner, such as changes in her breathing or gentle verbal responses. This troubleshooting phase is critical; it’s the moment to make minor adjustments—maybe a slight tweak in your lateral angle or a small change in the pace of your forward push—to further optimize your cumulative stimulation. Use the iterative cycle of the Sexual Scientific Process: define your objective for that cycle, form a hypothesis regarding a minute improvement, track the outcome meticulously, and refine your technique until it reaches perfection.
Once you’re satisfied with your adjustments, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as a unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the entire cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation throughout the vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate aim of your training. When you reach this state, your Bata Coxa Stroke will be a continuous, fluid expression of your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate precision—a true testament to your progress.
Celebrate this achievement, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated training into an art form—a performance in which every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your athletic mesomorph strength and balanced extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure with every move. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Bata Coxa Stroke bring you ever closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
