Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Bata Coxa Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to work with you—an ectomorph with a compact penis below 5 inches. Your naturally lean, agile build gives you exceptional speed and precision, while your smaller extension packs intense sensitivity. Today, we’re going to harness these qualities and translate your natural athleticism into a meticulously choreographed, cumulative performance designed to deliver deep, targeted pleasure.
Before we begin, find a quiet, comfortable space free from distractions where you can really focus. Sit back, relax your shoulders, and take several deep, controlled breaths. Let your mind clear and your focus sharpen—this is your time to learn and internalize every detail of our technique. In our training, we’re modifying the classic missionary position into a dynamic practice environment that works with your ectomorphic structure. You’ll start in a modified plank position with your knees planted firmly on a stable surface. This position is critical because it grounds your lean frame and allows you to execute every micro‑movement with precision, even when you deliver what may be a high-frequency, cumulative performance.
Now, let’s talk about the Bata Coxa Stroke itself. After inserting your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle, you begin by moving your body forward—moving north toward your partner’s head. In this forward phase, the top shelf of your penis gently massages her clitoral region while the head consistently maintains contact with her “south wall.” This initial forward push prepares the area to receive stimulation. However, the unique features of the Bata Coxa Stroke come into play next: you initiate a series of lateral movements with your left hip. Unlike other strokes, the Bata Coxa is characterized by its alternating pressure and friction generated primarily by dropping and raising the left hip in a specific sequence. As your left hip drops toward the canvas, the hilt of your penis—acting as a pressure applicator—begins to add steady pressure and friction, starting from the northern section of her vaginal opening and moving toward the western section. As you drop, your penis reorients; in this particular phase, it points east, effectively massaging upwards from the eastern wall of the vaginal canal to the northern wall.
Then, you raise your left hip back toward the center, reversing the previous motion. In doing so, the hilt of your shaft now applies pressure and friction starting from the western section moving to the northern section, with your penis reorienting to point north—massaging upward from the northern wall to the eastern wall. This drop-and-raise cycle is then repeated, with variations in pace and extent of hip movement. The stroke features alternating phases: one where your left hip drops and then returns to center at a regular pace, followed by phases where you raise the left hip halfway toward center at a faster pace. This difference in timing creates varied pressure and friction; for instance, at the faster pace, the hilt’s pressure and friction are directed from the western section toward a midpoint before transitioning, while your penis maintains a steady orientation that produces heat and tactile stimulation along the walls as it moves up or down. Finally, you complete the cycle by raising your left hip fully back to center, applying steady, cumulative pressure from the western to the northern section as your penis points north and massages upward from the northern wall to the eastern wall. This full cycle, once completed, is repeated continuously to establish a rhythmic, cumulative pattern of stimulation.
As you listen to these instructions, understand that the Bata Coxa Stroke is a demanding, intricate sequence of deliberate movements that transforms raw, raw ectomorphic agility and the sensitivity inherent in a compact extension into a fluid performance of intimate mastery. Today, we lay the foundation to transform your natural attributes into a stroke that delivers scientifically optimized, cumulative pleasure. Welcome, brother—let’s begin this journey together.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Before diving into the specific details of the Bata Coxa Stroke, it’s crucial to understand the core elements that support our training. Each of these principles functions as a cornerstone for your performance:
The 80‑10‑10 Principle: This principle instructs you to distribute stimulation in a balanced, effective way. Specifically, about 80% of your applied force should target the shallow vaginal zone—roughly the first 1 to 3 inches—because this area contains the highest density of nerve endings and is naturally the most sensitive. The remaining 20% of your force should be divided evenly, so that 10% reaches the mid‑depth (approximately 3–5 inches) and 10% reaches the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). In practice, this means every movement of your stroke must be calibrated so that most of your stimulation is delivered precisely where it’s most effective.
The Sexual Scientific Process: This process is your systematic roadmap for refining your technique. It comprises four key steps:
Define Goal: Establish exactly what you want to achieve—for example, maximum stimulation of the northern and western vaginal walls during a hip drop.
Form Hypothesis: Based on your observations and your partner’s feedback, predict which slight adjustments (perhaps a minor change in the pace of your left hip drop) might yield better stimulation.
Track: Methodically perform a significant number of repetitions—ideally 30 strokes or more per “wall” of the vaginal canal—and carefully record both your internal feedback and your partner’s responses.
Flow: Once you’ve identified the most effective adjustments, commit to a rhythmic, automatic repetition, allowing your stroke to flow naturally with the 80‑10‑10 distribution intact.
Tracking: Tracking involves gathering data during each cycle of your stroke. You do this by paying close attention to your partner’s physical responses—her breathing, subtle body movements, or quiet verbal cues—as well as your own internal sensations, like the engagement of your core or the contraction of your pelvic floor. This systematic observation helps you determine what works and what might need modifying, so you can refine every component of your stroke.
Flow: Flow is the state of seamless integration where your movements become natural and automatic. Once you’ve refined your technique through careful tracking and data-driven adjustments, you’ll reach a point where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle merges without conscious effort. In this state, the 80‑10‑10 distribution is maintained consistently, and your stroke becomes a rhythmic, continuous expression of cumulative stimulation.
The Tap Keystroke: The tap keystroke is a foundational drill used to develop precise lateral control. In its simplest form, you start in a steady position—often a forearm plank—shift laterally until your hip gently “taps” the supporting surface, and then return smoothly to center. This controlled, minimal movement trains the muscles responsible for lateral shifts, enhances pelvic floor control (especially when combined with kegeling and coordinated breathing), and builds the muscle memory needed for consistent, deliberate movements. Mastering the tap keystroke is essential for executing the lateral components of the Bata Coxa Stroke, ensuring that every side shift is controlled and contributes optimally to the cumulative stimulation.
Together, these core elements—balanced force distribution, a systematic approach to refinement, careful tracking, a state of flow, and the mastery of lateral movement through the tap keystroke—form the backbone of your training. They ensure that every micro‑movement in the Bata Coxa Stroke is executed with scientific precision and targeted intensity, ultimately transforming raw motion into an artful, cumulative performance that maximizes pleasure.
With these principles clearly understood, you’re now fully equipped to execute the Bata Coxa Stroke in technical detail. Next, we’ll break down the stroke into its fundamental components and explain how you can apply these principles to each phase of the movement.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, it’s time to break down the Bata Coxa Stroke into its core components so you can master each element individually before combining them into one seamless performance. Picture yourself in the missionary position—on top in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on the canvas. With your ectomorphic build and a penis below 5 inches, precision is paramount as you execute each movement of this stroke, which is designed to create an intricate pattern of cumulative stimulation. Let’s deconstruct the movement step by step.
Forward Movement: The stroke begins with you inserting your penis at a downward diagonal angle into your partner. From this position, you move your entire body forward—northward toward your partner’s head. During this forward push, the top shelf of your compact penis glides gently over her clitoral area, while the head maintains consistent, deliberate contact with her south wall. This initial movement sets up the stimulation zone, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is delivered to the shallow, nerve‑rich area according to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Because your extension is compact, this precision is crucial to focus maximum stimulation on the sensitive entry area.
Lateral Shift (Left Hip Drop): After the forward push, the stroke transitions into the lateral phase. Here, you drop your left hip toward the canvas. This controlled drop is where the unique characteristics of the Bata Coxa Stroke come into play. As you drop your left hip, the hilt (base) of your penis applies firm, steady pressure and friction starting at the northern section of your partner’s vaginal opening and moving toward its western section. Simultaneously, during this drop, your penis reorients so that it points east—massaging upward along the eastern wall toward the northern wall. This action generates heat, friction, and a focused pressure that contributes to cumulative stimulation. The drop is deliberate and measured—every movement is engineered to enhance the stimulation distribution based on the 80‑10‑10 balance.
Hip Raise to Center (First Reversal): Immediately following the left hip drop, you raise your left hip back toward the center. In doing so, the hilt applies pressure and friction now starting from the western section of the vaginal opening, moving upward to the northern section. At the same time, your penis reorients to point north, providing an upward massage from the northern wall to the eastern wall. This reversal shifts the stimulation pattern slightly and helps integrate the cumulative effects from the previous phase. The key here is consistency—ensure that the same level of precision is maintained and that the force distribution remains within the prescribed 80‑10‑10 framework.
Repeating the Cycle with Variations in Pace: The stroke continues with repetitions of this drop-and-raise sequence. For example, after the initial full raise to center, you then execute another left hip drop with the same technique—again focusing on directing pressure from the northern to the western sections and reorienting the penis to point east for an upward massage on the eastern wall. Then, you raise your left hip halfway toward the center, but this time at a faster pace. This variation in speed intensifies the friction and pressure: the hilt now applies force starting from the western section moving to a midpoint before reaching the northern section, while the penis points north to massage upward from the northern to the eastern wall. Next, you drop again—this time the movement starts halfway between the western and northern sections and travels to the western section, with the penis reoriented to point east for an upward massage once more. You repeat this faster half-raise and drop cycle, building a rhythmic pattern that intensifies the cumulative effect.
Full Return to Center: Finally, after these cycles of partial movements, you complete the stroke by raising your left hip fully back toward the center. In this final phase, the hilt consistently applies pressure and friction from the western to the northern sections, while your penis points north and massages upward from the northern wall to the eastern wall. Once complete, the stroke resets and the entire sequence starts over again. This cyclical repetition—first forward push, then a series of lateral drops and raises with varying pace—creates a “W” shaped pattern that is both dynamic and cumulative.
Each of these components must be executed with meticulous precision, with the 80‑10‑10 principle guiding the force distribution and the Sexual Scientific Process ensuring continuous refinement. By deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into these discrete phases, you create a blueprint that enables you to target the most sensitive areas effectively while still engaging deeper tissues through cumulative stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each individual component of the Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes second nature. With your ectomorphic build and a penis below 5 inches, precision and control are absolutely paramount. We’re going to focus on repetitive, intensive practice of each segmented movement so that every phase is executed perfectly in accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Begin with the forward movement drill. Get into your modified plank position—make sure your knees are securely planted on a stable surface that supports your lean frame. Insert your penis at the perfect downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Concentrate on maintaining the correct level of contact: feel the top shelf of your compact penis glide gently across her clitoral area, and ensure that the head keeps constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is below 5 inches, it is critical that you focus approximately 80% of your force on the shallow zone. Execute this forward push slowly and deliberately, and repeat it several times until you can reproduce the same smooth, controlled motion consistently.
Next, focus on the lateral tap—known as the tap keystroke drill. From your forward position, carefully raise your left hip in a small, controlled lateral shift until your hip makes a gentle tap on the supporting surface. Visualize how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, focused pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening as your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a subtle rocking massage on her right internal wall. Synchronize each lateral tap with deep, deliberate breathing—inhaling before you initiate the movement and exhaling slowly as you complete the tap. To further build precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each lateral tap. Drill this lateral movement repeatedly—aim for at least 30 slow, deliberate repetitions on each side—until the motion becomes fully ingrained in your muscle memory.
After you have refined the lateral tap, move on to the hip lowering phase. After each lateral tap, slowly lower your raised hip until it touches the supporting surface. Focus on the sensations: feel how the underbelly of your penis begins to apply consistent pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf maintains steady contact with her upper wall. This movement needs to be gradual and controlled to ensure that the cumulative stimulation is maintained precisely. Finally, practice the backward shuttle—slowly retract your body in a controlled manner so that your penis remains in constant contact with her north wall as you reset, without complete withdrawal. Repeat the entire sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times until every transition flows smoothly and every micro‑movement is executed exactly in line with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout your drilling session, make sure your breathing is deep, slow, and synchronized with each movement. Each deep inhale will sharpen your focus and prep your body for the next micro‑movement, while every controlled exhale will allow for smooth, natural transitions. With consistent, focused practice, your ectomorphic agility and compact extension will merge into a perfectly executed set of movements that are natural, cumulative, and extremely precise.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—this is the true art of the Bata Coxa Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified plank, with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your mind exclusively focused on the integration of every movement. In this module, you will merge your forward push, lateral taps (using the tap keystroke), controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle into one unified rhythmic cycle that forms the distinctive “W” pattern of the stroke.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the precise downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward—north toward your partner’s head. As you do so, ensure that the top shelf of your compact penis consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push sets the foundation for cumulative stimulation and must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, delivering around 80% of your force to the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase. Execute three controlled lateral taps by lowering your left hip in the form of the tap keystroke. As you perform each lateral tap, focus on how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, controlled pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right—generating a gentle rocking massage on her right wall. Once these lateral taps are executed flawlessly, gradually lower your raised hip so that the underbelly of your penis maintains continuous, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf stays firmly in contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle until you return to the starting position, keeping your penis in constant contact with her north wall.
After completing one full cycle on one side, reset and mirror the entire sequence on the opposite side. Raise your right hip laterally this time and perform three deliberate lateral taps, ensuring that the right side of your penis engages the left vaginal opening while your left side produces that consistent rocking massage on her right internal wall. Lower your hip in a controlled manner and then shuttle backward until you’re back at your starting position. This alternating “walking” motion of your hips creates the rhythmic “W” pattern that defines the Bata Coxa Stroke, ensuring balanced and cumulative stimulation across the entire vaginal canal.
Throughout the integrated routine, let your deep, rhythmic breathing serve as your internal metronome. Inhale deeply before each phase to prime your body, and exhale steadily to facilitate smooth transitions between the forward push, lateral taps, hip lowering, and backward shuttle. With each complete cycle, your natural ectomorphic finesse and compact extension will meld into a continuous, fluid performance—a Bata Coxa Stroke that is both scientifically precise and intimately satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our goal is to finely adjust every micro‑movement of the Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal, cumulative stimulation. With your athletic ectomorph build and a penis below 5 inches, every movement must be executed with remarkable precision to meet the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that about 80% of your applied force is focused on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly distributed between the mid‑depth and deep areas.
As you cycle through the integrated routine, closely observe each element. During the forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your compact penis glides consistently over her clitoral area, and that the head maintains deliberate, unbroken contact with her south wall. Then, while executing the lateral taps with the tap keystroke, pay attention to the natural, subtle rocking motion produced by your controlled lateral shifts. Since your extension is compact, even the smallest adjustment in your lateral angle can significantly impact the cumulative stimulation. Experiment with slight modifications—adjust your lateral movement by a degree or two—and carefully track how these changes affect the pressure distribution and the overall rocking effect. Listen to your partner’s feedback—her breathing patterns, soft verbal cues, or slight body movements are crucial data. This is the essence of the Sexual Scientific Process: define your goal for the cycle (for example, achieving a smoother rocking effect), form a hypothesis about a small adjustment, track the results over multiple repetitions, and fine‑tune your technique accordingly.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout every cycle—each deep inhale readies your body for the upcoming movement, while each controlled exhale smooths out the transitions between phases. Over time, as you continuously incorporate these small adjustments based on precise internal cues and your partner’s feedback, you’ll reach a state of flow—a seamless, automatic performance where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with impeccable precision. When you achieve this state of flow, your Bata Coxa Stroke becomes a continuously rhythmic, cumulative expression of controlled stimulation that adheres perfectly to the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Remember, brother, that every tiny adjustment is crucial. Your athletic ectomorph build and compact extension allow you to deliver intensely focused stimulation, but only if each micro‑movement is executed with consistency and precision. Keep tracking your internal signals—such as your core engagement and pelvic floor contraction—and align them carefully with your partner’s subtle responses. With persistent, methodical refinements, your Bata Coxa Stroke will evolve into a naturally flowing, scientifically optimized performance that delivers cumulative pleasure with every repetition.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to develop your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen specifically designed to reinforce every element of the Bata Coxa Stroke while also building the core strength and overall stability that are critical for your athletic ectomorph build and a penis below 5 inches. This module is your comprehensive blueprint for transforming your natural agility and precision into a consistent, refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically calibrated stimulation.
Begin by establishing your own dedicated training space—a quiet, private area where you can focus exclusively on mastering your technique. Each training session should begin with a thorough warm‑up tailored to your ectomorphic physique. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back—these muscles are the foundation for every precise movement during the stroke. Visualize each stretch as a signal that awakens your internal engine, preparing every muscle fiber and joint for the detailed work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for the session.
Next, focus on specialized drills that hone each individual component of the stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. In your modified plank position—with your knees firmly planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. Since your penis is compact (below 5 inches), each lateral tap must be executed with extreme precision. Concentrate on raising your left hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to the center. Synchronize these movements with deliberate, steady breathing—inhaling deeply before the shift and exhaling slowly as you complete the tap. For added precision, incorporate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each lateral tap, which helps lock in the exact pressure you need. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke becomes a natural part of your muscle memory.
Once you’ve honed the lateral tap, integrate it with vertical components. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps, and then finish with a smooth backward shuttle—ensuring that every movement strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this full integrated cycle repeatedly on both sides until every transition feels fluid and perfectly timed. To further enhance your stability and precision, supplement your stroke-specific drills with targeted core strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills. A strong core is vital to maintaining balance and ensuring that every micro‑movement of the Bata Coxa Stroke is executed with optimal control. Keep a detailed training journal to record each session—document the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you experiment with, and your partner’s feedback. This journal is an essential tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to track progress and continually refine your performance.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural ectomorphic agility and precision into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of your rigorous practice, where your athletic ectomorph build and compact extension come together in a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly on the supporting surface, your core engaged, and your mind entirely attuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your penis consistently caresses her clitoral region and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward drive must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, directing about 80% of your applied force to the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone, with the remainder carefully balanced to stimulate the mid‑depth and deep areas.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by performing the tap keystroke with your left hip. Raise your hip in a small, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps. Focus intently on how the hilt of your penis adds controlled pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your shaft reorients so that its inner surface points to the right—thereby creating a rhythmic, rocking massage on her right internal wall. If any tap seems inconsistent—if the pressure is uneven or if the lateral angle is off—pause and isolate that movement. Drill that segment until your internal signals and your partner’s subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced according to the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Then, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while giving you the opportunity to gather precise internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, pay close attention to the contraction of your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor, and listen carefully to your partner’s responses. This is your troubleshooting moment—if the cumulative stimulation isn’t hitting the mark, make minor adjustments to your lateral angle or the pace of your forward drive. Employ the iterative cycle of the Sexual Scientific Process: define your goal for that cycle, form a hypothesis regarding a small improvement, track the feedback, and refine your technique until it is optimized.
Once you have refined your technique, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation throughout the vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you reach that state, your Bata Coxa Stroke will stand as a testament to your disciplined practice and technical mastery—a seamless, cumulative performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply intimate.
Celebrate your achievement, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated training into an art form—a performance where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and deeply balanced stimulation. Your athletic mesomorph strength and compact extension have been honed into a continuous, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure in every move. Happy training, brother—continue refining, tracking, and evolving your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Bata Coxa Stroke bring you closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
