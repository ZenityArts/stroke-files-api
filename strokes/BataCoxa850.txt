Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Bata Coxa Stroke! I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to work with you—an endomorph with an extension above 7 inches. Your body is built for power and endurance, a robust, full‑figured frame that provides the stability and strength to deliver deeply controlled, forceful movements. With your extra‑long extension, you not only have the ability to cover a wider stimulation field, but you also carry tremendous sensitivity along every inch. Today, we’re going to convert that raw, heavy‑set power into a meticulously choreographed sequence that maximizes cumulative stimulation with scientific precision.
Before we kick things off, find a quiet, comfortable space—a training sanctuary where you won’t be disturbed. Sit back or lie down, relax your broad shoulders, and take several deep, controlled breaths until your mind is focused and your body is ready to perform. Our session today is about converting your natural, endomorphic energy into a rhythmic dance of intentional movement. In the Bata Coxa Stroke, we modify the classic missionary position to create an environment that supports and enhances your powerful build. You’ll start by assuming a modified plank position, with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. This grounding is critical for your heavy‑set frame; it anchors your body, ensuring that every micro‑movement is executed with deliberate control.
Once in position, insert your penis at a carefully calculated downward diagonal angle into your partner. This initial alignment is the blueprint for everything that follows. Now, begin with a smooth, measured forward push—moving your entire body gradually northward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, the top shelf of your extra‑long penis glides over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, you have the potential to reach deeply. However, to achieve cumulative stimulation effectively, you must maintain strict control over your force. We use the 80‑10‑10 principle as our guide—roughly 80% of your applied force should focus on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining 20% is divided equally between the mid‑depth (approximately 3–5 inches) and the deep (beyond 5 inches) areas. This precise force distribution allows you to harness the full potential of your extra‑long extension, delivering maximum pleasure right where it’s needed while keeping the deeper tissues engaged in a gentle, balanced manner.
After that precise forward push, the stroke transitions into its signature lateral phase. Here is where your endomorphic stability plays a crucial role. You’ll initiate a series of lateral movements—particularly with your left hip—that are designed to trace a “W” pattern across your partner’s vaginal canal. For the Bata Coxa Stroke, you start by lowering your left hip slowly toward the canvas. As you do so, the hilt (or base) of your penis applies a firm, focused pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right, creating friction and a gentle rocking massage on her right wall. This lateral drop is executed with deliberate control so that the cumulative stimulation adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Following the drop, you reverse the motion by raising your left hip back toward the center—this reversal shifts the pressure, so now the hilt applies a steady force from the western section of the vaginal opening to the northern section, while your penis reorients to point straight north and massages upward from the northern to the eastern wall.
The stroke continues as you repeat this drop-and-raise sequence. In some cycles, you might vary the pace—raising your left hip only halfway toward the center at a slightly faster pace to intensify friction and change the pressure pattern, then lowering again. These subtle variations create a dynamic, cumulative effect; the different paces add nuance to the stimulation, ensuring that over the full cycle, all sensitive zones are engaged effectively. Finally, you complete the sequence by fully raising your left hip to center, thereby resetting the cycle before the stroke begins anew.
Today’s module lays the foundation for turning your powerful, full‑figured endomorphic energy and extended reach into a performance that is both scientifically precise and intimately expressive. Every forward push, lateral drop-and-raise, and backward shuttle is designed to adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle while delivering cumulative stimulation with controlled precision. Welcome, brother—let’s begin this journey of transforming raw physical power into an artful expression of intimate mastery through the Bata Coxa Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re going to break down and fully explain the core principles that underpin our training process. These elements—the 80‑10‑10 principle, the Sexual Scientific Process (which includes tracking and flow), and the tap keystroke—are the foundation for executing the Bata Coxa Stroke with scientific precision and cumulative effect.
The 80‑10‑10 Principle: This principle is the heart of effective stimulation. It directs you to focus approximately 80% of your applied force on the shallow zone of the vaginal canal—usually the first 1 to 3 inches—which is the area with the highest concentration of nerve endings and, consequently, the most sensitive. The remaining 20% of your force should be divided equally between the mid‑depth (roughly 3–5 inches) and deep (beyond 5 inches) zones. For the Bata Coxa Stroke, this means every movement you execute must be carefully calibrated so that the overwhelming majority of the stimulation is delivered to that key shallow region, while the mid‑depth and deep layers receive a gentle, balanced touch. This balance is especially crucial when you have an extension above 7 inches, as you have a broader stimulation field that, if not controlled, can lead to diluted or unbalanced pressure.
The Sexual Scientific Process: This process is a systematic, iterative method for refining your technique and is similar to the scientific method. It comprises four key steps:
Define Goal: Clearly identify what you want to achieve with your stroke. For example, you might set a goal to maximize friction and pressure along the left and right walls during the lateral phases.
Form Hypothesis: Based on your observations and initial feedback, make an educated guess about what minor adjustment—perhaps a slight change in the pace of your hip drop—might improve stimulation.
Track: Methodically perform a high number of repetitions (ideally at least 30 strokes on each “wall” of the vaginal canal) while carefully monitoring your internal sensations (like core and pelvic floor engagement) and your partner’s responses (her breathing, verbal cues, or subtle shifts in body language).
Flow: Once you have identified the stroke variation that delivers the best results, commit to that rhythmic, automatic sequence until your movements become entirely instinctive.
This iterative process ensures that you are continually refining your technique, transforming subjective sensations into measurable improvements.
Tracking: Tracking is about gathering detailed data from each stroke. As you perform the Bata Coxa Stroke, pay keen attention to how your partner responds, whether through deeper breaths, subtle physical shifts, or light verbal feedback, and also note the sensations in your own body. This careful observation allows you to determine which aspects of your stroke are working optimally, and which need fine‑tuning. By methodically recording this feedback, you can adjust your technique so that every repetition brings you closer to your ideal performance.
Flow: Flow is the state you achieve when your stroke becomes seamless and automatic—a continuous, rhythmic performance where every micro‑movement transitions perfectly into the next. When you’re in flow, you don’t have to consciously think about each step; your body moves in perfect harmony, ensuring that the 80‑10‑10 force distribution is maintained consistently throughout your stroke. Achieving flow is the pinnacle of training, as it means your technique has been internalized completely.
The Tap Keystroke: The tap keystroke is a fundamental drill that trains your lateral movement. To perform it, begin in a stable position (typically a forearm plank) and then shift laterally until your hip gently “taps” the supporting surface before returning to center. This deliberate, minimal lateral movement not only builds muscle memory in your lateral and pelvic floor muscles but also ensures that you execute each lateral movement with controlled precision. Coordinating the tap keystroke with deep, rhythmic breathing enhances your focus and accuracy, ultimately translating into more effective cumulative stimulation in the Bata Coxa Stroke.
By thoroughly understanding these core principles—the precise stimulation distribution of the 80‑10‑10 principle, the systematic refinement through the Sexual Scientific Process (with tracking and flow), and the foundational skill of the tap keystroke—you’re ready to optimize every phase of the Bata Coxa Stroke. These elements will guide you in converting your natural physical attributes into a stroke that is scientifically precise and intimately effective.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break the Bata Coxa Stroke down into its core components so that you can master each element individually before integrating them into one seamless, cumulative performance. Picture yourself in the missionary position once again—on top in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. With your athletic ectomorphic build and an extension above 7 inches, every micro‑movement must be executed with precision. We’re going to isolate each phase of the stroke so that you have a complete blueprint to follow.
Forward Movement: Begin by inserting your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. From this starting position, gently push your entire body forward—moving north toward her head. During the forward push, the top shelf of your extended penis glides gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward phase is critical because it sets up the stimulation area, ensuring that about 80% of your force, per the 80‑10‑10 principle, is concentrated on the shallow zone (roughly the first 1 to 3 inches). With your extra‑long extension, each inch of forward movement has to be carefully controlled to target that sensitive region while avoiding excessive deep penetration.
Lateral Phase (Left Hip Drop): After the forward push, transition into the lateral phase. From your forward position, initiate a controlled lateral shift by dropping your left hip toward the canvas. In this phase, the hilt (or base) of your penis applies precise, focused pressure along the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening. Simultaneously, your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right—creating friction and a gentle, rocking massage upward from the eastern wall to the northern wall of her vaginal canal. This left hip drop is executed using the tap keystroke, meaning that the lateral movement is small, deliberate, and perfectly controlled. Your extra‑long extension means that every drop has to be calibrated so that the bulk of the force is directed to the shallow, sensitive area while still achieving the necessary friction on the walls.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Reversal): Immediately following the left hip drop, raise your left hip back to center. This reversal shifts the applied pressure: now the hilt applies force from the western section toward the northern section, and your penis reorients to point directly north. As a result, you deliver a gentle upward massage from the northern wall to the eastern wall. This controlled raise is crucial because it integrates the stimulation from the drop phase while maintaining the steady rhythm of the stroke. It’s essential that each raise is executed with precision, keeping the 80‑10‑10 distribution intact.
Cycle Repetition and Variations in Pace: The stroke continues with repeated cycles of left hip drops and raises. In some cycles, you might raise your left hip only halfway toward center, moving at a slightly faster pace to introduce a variation in friction that intensifies the cumulative stimulation in a different pattern. Then, you may perform another drop, followed by a final full raise to center that resets the cycle. This alternating and varied pace creates a dynamic “W” pattern that evolves the stimulation over multiple repetitions while still following the overall 80‑10‑10 force distribution.
This deconstructed sequence—forward movement, lateral drop via the tap keystroke, controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle (which resets the stroke)—provides you with a clear roadmap for performance. Every component is essential, and each must be executed with the precision required to ensure that approximately 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow zone, maximizing sensitivity while the mid‑depth and deep areas receive gentle engagement. This blueprint is the foundation for transforming your extended ectomorphic grace into a finely tuned, cumulative performance that is both scientifically optimized and intimately effective.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each individual component of the Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as your own breath. With your lean ectomorphic build and an extension above 7 inches, precision and consistency are of utmost importance. In this module, we’ll focus on repetitive, focused practice for each segmented phase—starting with the forward push, then isolating the lateral drop (using the tap keystroke), followed by controlled hip lowering, and finally finishing with the backward shuttle. Every repetition must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle so that your extended range is utilized perfectly.
Forward Movement Drill: Begin by assuming your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable and supportive surface—this is essential for anchoring your lean frame. Insert your penis at the perfect downward diagonal angle, and then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Concentrate on the sensations as the top shelf of your extended penis glides smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, it’s critical that about 80% of your force is channeled into stimulating the shallow, sensitive zone. Execute this forward push slowly and deliberately, and repeat the motion multiple times until you can reproduce the same smooth, controlled forward drive with consistent precision.
Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): Next, isolate the lateral component by performing the tap keystroke. From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a small, controlled lateral motion until your hip gently taps the supporting surface. Visualize how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, focused pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, producing a subtle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Each lateral tap should be synchronized with deep, controlled breathing—inhale deeply before initiating the drop, and exhale slowly as you complete the tap. To further enhance precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each lateral movement. Drill this lateral tap repeatedly—aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side—until the tap keystroke becomes completely ingrained in your muscle memory.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: After perfecting your lateral tap, shift your focus to the lowering phase. Following each lateral tap, slowly lower your dropped hip back to the supporting surface in a controlled manner. Pay close attention to the sensation—feel the underbelly of your penis begin to apply steady, cumulative pressure on her lower wall while the upper shelf maintains constant contact with her upper wall. Then, practice the backward shuttle by slowly and deliberately retracting your body so that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall, preparing you for the next cycle without fully withdrawing. Drill the complete sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—repeatedly until every transition flows seamlessly and every micro‑movement adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout your drilling session, ensure that your breathing remains deep, controlled, and synchronized with every movement. Let each deep inhale sharpen your focus and prepare you for the next micro‑movement, while every controlled exhale facilitates a smooth, natural transition between phases. With disciplined, repetitive practice, your lean ectomorphic agility, combined with your extended reach, will merge into a series of precisely executed, cumulative movements that become second nature.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—that is where the art of the Bata Coxa Stroke truly comes to life. Return to your starting position in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, your core engaged, and your mind solely focused on creating a fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this module, you will merge your forward push, lateral taps (using the tap keystroke), controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle into one unified, rhythmic cycle that forms the distinctive “W” pattern of the stroke.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward—moving steadily north toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extended penis consistently caresses her clitoral region and that the head maintains unwavering, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push is critical as it establishes the baseline for cumulative stimulation, strictly following the 80‑10‑10 principle by allocating approximately 80% of your force to the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase. Execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip using the tap keystroke. With each lateral tap, focus intently on how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, precise pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Once these lateral taps are executed flawlessly, gradually lower your dropped hip so that the underbelly of your penis applies steady, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf remains in consistent contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle until you return to your starting position, ensuring that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall throughout the retraction.
After completing one full cycle on one side, reset and mirror the entire sequence on the opposite side. Now, raise your right hip laterally and perform three deliberate lateral taps—this time, the right side of your penis should engage the left vaginal opening while the left side delivers a complementary, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall—then lower your hip in a controlled manner and shuttle backward until you return to your original starting position. This alternating “walking” motion of your hips creates the rhythmic “W” pattern that defines the Bata Coxa Stroke, delivering balanced cumulative stimulation in precise adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated sequence, allow your deep, rhythmic breathing to act as your internal metronome—inhale deeply before each phase to prime your body, and exhale steadily to ensure smooth transitions between movements. With every complete cycle, your lean ectomorphic precision and extended reach come together in a continuous, fluid performance—a Bata Coxa Stroke that is both scientifically refined and intimately satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our focus is on fine‑tuning every micro‑adjustment of your Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your lean ectomorphic build and a penis measuring between 5 and 7 inches, every movement must be executed with impeccable precision to adhere fully to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that approximately 80% of your applied force is directed to the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone, while the remaining force is evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep zones.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, closely observe every nuance of your performance. During the forward push, verify that the top shelf of your extended penis consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you execute your lateral taps using the tap keystroke, pay attention to the subtle, natural rocking motion produced by your controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even the slightest variation in your lateral angle can have a significant impact on cumulative stimulation. Experiment with minor adjustments—a change of one or two degrees in your hip drop—and carefully track how these modifications affect the overall pressure distribution and the rocking effect. Use your partner’s feedback—her deep, rhythmic breathing, gentle verbal cues, and subtle body movements—as essential data points. This iterative process of setting a clear goal, forming a hypothesis, tracking feedback, and refining your technique is at the very heart of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout every cycle. Each deep inhale will focus your energy and prime your body for the next precise movement, while every controlled exhale will facilitate smooth transitions between phases. Over repeated cycles, as you continually monitor your internal sensations (like core engagement and pelvic floor contractions) and your partner’s responses, you’ll eventually reach a state of flow—a seamless, automatic performance where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. Achieving this flow state is the ultimate goal of your training, as it indicates that your stroke is scientifically optimized and naturally rhythmic.
Remember, brother, every tiny adjustment matters. Your athletic mesomorph structure and balanced extension allow you to deliver intensely focused stimulation—provided every movement is executed with perfect consistency. With persistent tracking, meticulous adjustment, and continuous refinement, your Bata Coxa Stroke will evolve into a naturally flowing performance that delivers the perfect balance of cumulative pleasure and intimate precision.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen designed specifically to reinforce every element of the Bata Coxa Stroke while also strengthening the core and overall stability essential for your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your detailed roadmap for transforming your natural physical strength and precision into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically calibrated stimulation.
Begin by establishing your own dedicated training space—a quiet, private environment where distractions are eliminated and every movement is solely focused on perfecting your technique. Each training session should commence with an extensive warm‑up tailored to your athletic mesomorph physique. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back—the critical support system for every precise micro‑movement in the Bata Coxa Stroke. Visualize each stretch as firing up your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the intricate work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for your session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target each component of the stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees firmly planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis size between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Concentrate on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Synchronize each lateral movement with deep, deliberate breathing—inhaling deeply before initiating the shift and exhaling slowly as you complete the tap. To further enhance precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each lateral tap. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke becomes completely ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve mastered the lateral tap, integrate it with the vertical components. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and then a smooth, gradual backward shuttle—ensuring every micro‑movement strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this full integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition flows seamlessly. To further bolster your stability and control, supplement your stroke-specific drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills. A strong core is critical not only for maintaining balance but also for ensuring that every movement in the Bata Coxa Stroke is executed with optimal precision. Keep a detailed training journal where you record each session’s repetitions, note any slight adjustments you experiment with, and document feedback from your partner—this journal is a vital component of the Sexual Scientific Process that helps you track progress and continuously refine your technique.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural athletic mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance while troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module represents the culmination of your dedicated training, where your athletic mesomorph build and your penis between 5 and 7 inches converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your mind entirely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your penis consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle—about 80% of your applied force should target the shallow, nerve‑rich zone, while the remaining force is evenly distributed to engage the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your right hip. Raise your hip in a small, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps. With each tap, focus intently on ensuring that the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening, while the inner surface of your penis produces a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. If any lateral tap appears inconsistent—whether because of uneven pressure or a misaligned lateral angle—pause and isolate that specific movement, then drill it repeatedly until both your internal feedback and your partner’s subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced in line with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Next, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, pay close attention to the contraction of your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor, and listen carefully to any subtle verbal or nonverbal cues from your partner. This troubleshooting stage is essential; it’s where you make small adjustments—perhaps a slight tweak in your lateral angle or a minor variation in the pace of your forward push—to further optimize the cumulative stimulation. Use the iterative cycle of the Sexual Scientific Process: define your goal for that cycle, form a hypothesis regarding a minor improvement, meticulously track the outcome, and refine your technique until perfection is achieved.
Once you’re satisfied with your adjustments, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as a unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the entire cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation across the full expanse of the vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate aim of your training. When you reach that state, your Bata Coxa Stroke will stand as a testament to your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate sensitivity—a continuous, fluid performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your achievement, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated practice into an art form—a performance where every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and intimately balanced stimulation. Your athletic mesomorph strength and balanced extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure with every move. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Bata Coxa Stroke bring you ever closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
