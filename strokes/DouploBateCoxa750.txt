Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke! I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m excited to work with you—a lean, agile ectomorph blessed with an extension above 7 inches. Your physique is built for speed, elegance, and precision; you have long, slender limbs and a focused core, which gives you exceptional control. With an above‑7‑inch extension, you have an extended reach that can cover more stimulation area—but this also means every movement must be executed with meticulous precision to ensure the overwhelming sensitivity of the shallow vaginal zone isn’t spread too thin.
Find yourself a quiet space—a training sanctuary where you can focus completely on our session. Sit or lie down, relax those lean shoulders, and take several deep, slow breaths until your mind is clear and receptive. Today, we’re going to take your natural ectomorphic agility and your extended asset and convert them into a finely choreographed sequence of movements. Our new stroke, the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke, is a dual‑phase technique that first works the left side before seamlessly mirroring the same process on the right side. This dual‑phase design is intended to maximize cumulative stimulation on both sides of the vaginal canal, ensuring balanced intimacy.
We start by modifying the classic missionary position to suit your lean build. Begin in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. This foundation is key for you: it stabilizes your slender frame and provides the necessary support to execute every micro‑movement with precision. Once you’re steady, insert your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This precise insertion is critical—it sets the blueprint for the entire stroke.
Your first movement is a smooth, measured forward push. Slowly shift your entire body forward—moving north toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, the top shelf of your extended penis glides effortlessly over her clitoral region while the head keeps constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, it’s crucial that you focus most of your energy on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. We achieve this using the 80‑10‑10 principle: approximately 80% of your force will be dedicated to the shallow 1–3 inches, while the remaining 20% is split equally between the mid‑depth (3–5 inches) and the deep zones (beyond 5 inches).
Following the forward push, the stroke transitions into the lateral phase. Here, you’ll employ your natural ectomorphic agility to execute a series of controlled lateral movements that first operate on the left side and then, in mirrored fashion, on the right side. On the left, you gently drop your left hip toward the canvas. This lateral drop is performed using the tap keystroke—a small, deliberate movement that ensures precision. As you drop, the hilt of your penis applies focused pressure along the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening while your penis rotates so its inner surface points to the right, creating friction and a gentle rocking massage along her right wall. Then, you raise your left hip back to center in a controlled reversal that resets the cumulative pressure. Once the left‑side sequence is complete, you mirror the entire cycle on the right side—ensuring an evenly balanced “W” pattern across the vaginal canal.
This introduction sets the stage for converting your lean ectomorphic agility and extended reach into a scientifically controlled, cumulative performance. Every forward push, lateral drop and raise, and reset is designed to focus stimulation precisely where it matters most while maintaining a balanced overall rhythm. Welcome, brother—let’s begin turning your raw, natural potential into an artful expression of intimate mastery with the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re going to break down the foundational principles that will guide your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke, ensuring every movement is executed with scientific precision and cumulative impact.
The 80‑10‑10 Principle is our guiding force distribution model. It dictates that about 80% of your applied force should concentrate on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches—where nerve endings are densest and the area is most sensitive. The remaining 20% of your force is divided equally, with 10% directed to the mid‑depth zone (approximately 3–5 inches) and 10% to the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For an ectomorph with an above‑7‑inch extension, this precise distribution is essential, ensuring that while your extra length can engage deeper tissues, the bulk of the stimulation remains focused on the highly sensitive shallow area.
The Sexual Scientific Process is a systematic, iterative method for refining your technique:
Define Your Goal: Clearly state what you want to achieve with your stroke—for instance, maximizing friction during your lateral drop on each side.
Form a Hypothesis: Based on initial trials and feedback, predict which slight adjustments (such as altering the pace or angle of your hip drop) might yield better cumulative stimulation.
Track: Methodically perform a high number of repetitions—aim for at least 30 strokes per side—and record both internal cues (like core engagement and pelvic floor activation) and your partner’s responses (her breathing, subtle movements, and verbal feedback).
Flow: Once you identify the optimal stroke variation, commit to that continuous, automatic pattern. When you’re in flow, your movements transition seamlessly, and you consistently maintain the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Tracking is the ongoing process of gathering data. By methodically noting your partner’s reactions and your own internal sensations during the stroke, you can fine‑tune each micro‑movement until your technique is perfectly calibrated.
Flow is the state where your entire stroke becomes automatic and rhythmic. Once you have refined your technique through repeated practice and tracking, you’ll reach a point where every forward push, lateral drop, and backward shuttle occurs naturally, ensuring that the 80‑10‑10 principle is maintained throughout.
The Tap Keystroke is a foundational drill used to perfect your lateral movements. It involves starting in a stable position—often a forearm plank—shifting laterally until your hip gently “taps” the supporting surface, and then returning smoothly to the center. This controlled, minimal movement builds muscle memory and reinforces pelvic floor strength, which is especially critical for achieving the precise lateral shifts required in the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. Coordinating this drill with deep, measured breathing and kegeling exercises further sharpens your control.
Together, these principles provide the scientific framework for your training. They ensure that every movement in the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke is deliberate, cumulative, and focused on delivering stimulation exactly where it’s most effective. With this foundation firmly in place, you’re ready to move on to deconstructing the stroke into its core components.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into its individual components. Remember, this stroke operates in two phases—first, it works the left side, then it mirrors the sequence on the right side. As an ectomorph with a penis below 5 inches, each micro‑movement must be executed with precision to ensure intense, cumulative stimulation on a compact, highly sensitive area. We’ll start with the left‑side sequence and then describe how the right‑side mirroring completes the cycle.
Left‑Side Sequence:
Forward Movement: Insert your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. From this position, slowly push your entire body forward—moving northward toward her head. During this forward push, the top shelf of your compact extension glides gently over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” According to the 80‑10‑10 principle, roughly 80% of your applied force is focused on the shallow vaginal zone (the first 1–3 inches), setting the stage for maximum, cumulative stimulation in the most sensitive area.
Lateral Phase – Left Hip Drop: After the forward push, initiate the lateral phase on the left by carefully dropping your left hip toward the canvas. As you do so, the hilt of your penis applies focused pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, generating friction and a gentle, upward rocking massage along her right wall—from the eastern section moving toward the northern section. This lateral drop, executed using the tap keystroke, ensures that the majority of your stimulation remains focused on the shallow zone while building cumulative intensity.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Left‑Side Reversal): Immediately after the lateral drop, raise your left hip back to center in a smooth, controlled motion. In this reversal, the hilt shifts the pressure from the western section of her vaginal opening to the northern section, while your penis reorients to point directly north. This reorientation produces a gentle upward massage along the northern wall toward the eastern wall, integrating the stimulation from the lateral phase and preserving a consistent rhythm.
Cycle Repetition and Variations (Left Side): Repeat the lateral drop and raise cycle several times. You might incorporate variations in pace—for instance, executing a quicker, half‑raise before another drop—to increase friction and alter the pressure pattern slightly. These variations introduce dynamic texture while maintaining strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that cumulative stimulation is optimized in the shallow zone.
Right‑Side Mirrored Sequence:
Forward Movement (Repetition): After completing the left‑side sequence, reset by performing another forward push, identical in execution and adhering to the same 80‑10‑10 force distribution.
Lateral Phase – Right Hip Drop: Now, shift your focus to the right side. Perform a controlled lateral shift by dropping your right hip toward the canvas. In this mirror movement, the hilt of your penis applies consistent pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left, generating friction and a gentle rocking massage along her left wall—from the western section upward toward the northern section.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Right‑Side Reversal): Immediately raise your right hip back toward center to reset the pressure. Your penis reorients to point north, delivering upward stimulation along the northern wall toward the western wall.
Cycle Repetition (Right Side): Repeat the right‑side sequence, ensuring that each micro‑movement mirrors the left side exactly, so that stimulation is balanced and cumulative across both sides of the vaginal canal.
By deconstructing the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into these components, you achieve a clear, methodical blueprint: the left‑side sequence followed by the right‑side mirror. Each movement adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that about 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, sensitive zone, with the remaining force distributed evenly to the deeper layers. This breakdown is your roadmap to transforming your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension into a refined, cumulative performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as your breath. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a penis below 5 inches, precision and consistency are absolutely essential. In this module, we will focus on repetitive, intensive practice of each segmented phase—starting with the forward push, then isolating the lateral drop (using the tap keystroke) for the left side, followed by controlled hip raising, and finally the backward shuttle—and then mirror these drills on the right side. Every repetition must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle to ensure that your compact extension delivers precisely targeted stimulation.
Forward Movement Drill: Assume your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface—this anchors your lean frame. Insert your penis at the precise downward diagonal angle, and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation: feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide gently over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is compact, approximately 80% of your force should concentrate on the shallow, highly sensitive zone. Execute this forward push slowly and deliberately, repeating it several times until you can reproduce the movement with smooth, consistent precision.
Left‑Side Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a small, controlled lateral movement until your hip gently taps the supporting surface. Visualize how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, generating a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right wall. Synchronize each lateral tap with deep, controlled breathing—inhaling deeply before initiating the drop, and exhaling slowly as you complete it. Integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each tap to ensure precision. Drill this left‑side tap repeatedly—aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions—until it becomes an ingrained part of your muscle memory.
Right‑Side Lateral Tap Drill (Mirrored Tap Keystroke): Next, mirror the drill on the right side. From your forward position, carefully drop your right hip until it gently taps the supporting surface, then return smoothly to center. Here, visualize that the hilt applies steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left—producing the gentle rocking massage on her left wall. Synchronize this movement with controlled breathing and integrate kegeling for additional precision. Repeat for at least 30 deliberate repetitions until the movement is automatic.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: After performing lateral taps on each side, focus on the lowering phase. Following each lateral tap, slowly lower the dropped hip until it gently contacts the supporting surface, allowing the underbelly of your penis to apply cumulative, controlled pressure against her lower wall while the upper shelf stays in constant contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle—retract your body in a controlled manner so that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall as you reset your position without fully withdrawing. Repeat the full sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times on both the left and right sides until every transition flows seamlessly and every micro‑movement consistently adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout your drills, maintain deep, deliberate breathing; every deep inhale focuses your mind and prepares your body for the next precise movement, and every controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions between phases. With disciplined, consistent practice, your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension will integrate into a series of movements executed with flawless precision and cumulative intensity.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the true art of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified plank, ensuring your knees are firmly planted, your core is engaged, and your mind is focused entirely on creating a fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this module, you will merge your forward push, lateral taps (executed via the tap keystroke) on both the left and right sides, controlled hip lowering, and the backward shuttle into one unified, rhythmic cycle that forms the distinctive “W” pattern of the stroke.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward—moving steadily north toward your partner’s head. Ensure that the top shelf of your compact extension consistently glides over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push sets the baseline for cumulative stimulation and must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle by concentrating about 80% of your force on the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase. Start with the left‑side sequence by executing three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip using the tap keystroke. Focus on how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, creating a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right wall. Once those left‑side taps are complete, smoothly raise your left hip back to center to reset, then perform a slow, deliberate backward shuttle to return to your starting position—ensuring that your penis remains in constant contact with her north wall throughout.
Without delay, mirror the sequence on the right side. From your starting position, perform another forward push (keeping the same 80‑10‑10 force distribution), then execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your right hip until it taps the surface—this time, the hilt applies consistent pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left, delivering a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her left wall. After completing the right‑side taps, raise your right hip back to center, and then perform a smooth backward shuttle to reset.
This alternating “walking” motion—a left‑side sequence followed by a mirrored right‑side sequence—creates a rhythmic “W” pattern across the vaginal canal, ensuring balanced, cumulative stimulation on both sides and consistently adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated cycle, allow your deep, rhythmic breathing to serve as your internal metronome. Inhale deeply before each movement to prime your body, and exhale steadily to achieve smooth transitions. With each complete cycle, your natural ectomorphic precision and compact extension merge into one continuous, fluid performance—a Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke that is both scientifically refined and intimately effective.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our focus is on fine‑tuning every micro‑adjustment of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every movement must be executed with impeccable precision to adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that about 80% of your force is directed at the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining force is distributed evenly between the mid‑depth and deep zones.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, carefully observe every aspect of your performance. During the forward push, verify that the top shelf of your compact extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you execute your lateral taps using the tap keystroke on both sides, pay attention to the subtle rocking motions produced by your controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even a one or two degree variation in your hip drop can significantly influence cumulative stimulation. Experiment with slight adjustments—alter the pace or angle of your hip drop—and meticulously track how these tweaks affect the pressure distribution and rocking effect. Use your partner’s feedback—her deep, rhythmic breathing, soft verbal cues, and subtle physical adjustments—as vital data points. This iterative process, which involves defining your goals, forming hypotheses, tracking outcomes, and refining your technique, is the essence of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout each cycle. Every deep inhale should prepare your body for the next movement, while each controlled exhale ensures smooth, natural transitions between phases. Over repeated cycles, as you continuously monitor your internal sensations (such as core engagement and pelvic floor contraction) and your partner’s responses, you will enter a state of flow—a seamless, automatic performance in which every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed flawlessly. When you achieve this flow state, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will become a continuous, rhythmic expression of cumulative stimulation that perfectly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Remember, brother, that every tiny adjustment is critical. Your ectomorphic frame and compact extension provide a delicate platform where precision is paramount. Continuously track your internal cues and your partner’s subtle feedback, and refine your technique until every micro‑movement is executed with absolute consistency and precision.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen designed to reinforce every aspect of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke while strengthening the core and overall stability necessary for your lean ectomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your detailed roadmap for transforming your natural agility and precision into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically optimized stimulation.
Start by establishing your own dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are minimized and your focus is solely on mastering your technique. Every training session should begin with an extensive warm‑up specifically tailored to your ectomorphic physique. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back—these are the vital support areas that empower you to execute every precise micro‑movement in the stroke. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, prepping your muscles and joints for the detailed work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for your session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target each component of the stroke. Begin with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees securely planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be performed with pinpoint accuracy. Focus on raising your right hip just enough to gently tap the surface, then return smoothly to the center. Synchronize each lateral movement with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale as you begin the shift and exhale slowly upon completion. To enhance precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each lateral tap. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke is fully ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve perfected the lateral tap, integrate it with the vertical movements. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and then a smooth, gradual backward shuttle—ensuring that every micro‑movement strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this full integrated sequence repeatedly on both the left and right sides until every transition flows seamlessly. To further enhance your stability and precision, supplement your stroke‑specific drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic balance drills. A strong core is essential to maintain both the balance and exact control required for the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. Finally, keep a detailed training journal in which you record every session—the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you experiment with, and the feedback from your partner. This journal is an indispensable part of the Sexual Scientific Process, helping you monitor progress and continuously refine your technique.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural ectomorphic precision and compact extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of your disciplined practice, where your lean ectomorphic build and your penis between 5 and 7 inches converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your mind entirely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extended penis consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, concentrating about 80% of your force on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone, with the remaining force carefully distributed to engage the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your right hip. Raise your hip in a small, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps. With every lateral tap, focus intently on ensuring that the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. If any lateral tap appears inconsistent—due to uneven pressure or a slight misalignment—pause and isolate that movement, then drill it repeatedly until your internal feedback and your partner’s subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Next, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, focus on the contraction of your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for any subtle cues from your partner, such as changes in her breathing or soft verbal responses. This troubleshooting stage is essential; if you find that the cumulative stimulation isn’t optimized, make slight adjustments—perhaps a minor tweak in your lateral angle or a small change in the pace of your forward push—and meticulously track the outcomes using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation across the vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you reach this state, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will stand as a testament to your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate finesse—a continuous, fluid performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated practice into a true art form—a performance in which every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your athletic mesomorph strength and moderate extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure in every move. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke bring you ever closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
