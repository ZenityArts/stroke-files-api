Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformative journey with the Tambor Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and it’s my privilege to guide you through this program specifically designed for ectomorphs with an extension above 7 inches. Your lean, athletic build gives you exceptional speed and agility, and your extended asset allows you to reach deeper, offering you the chance to deliver extensive stimulation when used with precise technique. Today, we’re going to channel your natural kinetic energy into the Tambor Stroke—a fast-paced, dynamic technique driven by rapid hip rotations that create explosive, cumulative stimulation.
Imagine stepping into your personal training space—a quiet, dedicated sanctuary where distractions fade away and every focus is solely on perfecting your technique. Feel the solid, supportive ground beneath your feet; it’s as steady as your own lean frame. Take a few deep, deliberate breaths, filling your body with energy and focus on every inhale, then releasing tension with each exhale. This is your arena, brother—a space where your raw ectomorphic potential is refined into a masterpiece of intimate art.
We start by adapting the classic missionary position to suit your ectomorphic structure. Assume a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that complements your long, lean limbs and agile core. This foundational stance anchors your entire body so that every micro‑movement—from the subtle shift of your hips to the rapid, dynamic rotations—is executed with deliberate control and precision. With your extended asset above 7 inches, you have the ability to reach profound depths, but every move must be measured to ensure that your force is applied precisely to maximize cumulative stimulation without overwhelming her sensitive areas.
Once you’re anchored, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This insertion is your blueprint—it sets the exact angles and pressure points that will govern every subsequent movement in the Tambor Stroke. Your journey commences with a smooth, deliberate forward push. As you drive your body forward toward your partner’s head, feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide gracefully over her clitoral region while the head stays in constant, intentional contact with her “south wall.” Because you can reach deep with your asset, the 80‑10‑10 principle guides you: about 80% of your force must be concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining 20% is evenly apportioned between the mid‑depth and deep layers—ensuring a cumulative and balanced effect.
After the forward push, the Tambor Stroke shifts into its signature phase. At this point, you have the option to operate in one of two modes—going right or going left—each using fast-paced hip rotations to generate rapid, cumulative stimulation. When you choose Tambor going right, you execute rapid hip rotations to the right. In this mode, the hilt of your penis applies pressure as it canvasses the vaginal opening from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment, while the head rapidly points toward the southwestern wall, then shifts to the north‑western wall—delivering dynamic, explosive stimulation. Conversely, if you choose Tambor going left, the hilt applies pressure as it canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, with the head first pointing toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. These fast-paced rotations require speed and precision, a combination your ectomorphic nature naturally provides.
This introduction sets the stage, brother. It shows you how to establish your environment, align your posture, and channel your lean, extended potential into the Tambor Stroke—a technique that marries rapid, dynamic hip rotations with controlled power to generate cumulative, precise stimulation. Welcome, brother—today we begin turning your innate potential into an intimate masterpiece.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Alright, brother, let’s break down the technical framework that gives the Tambor Stroke its precision and cumulative power. This module is where we meld science with the art of intimate movement, ensuring every motion you execute is deliberate and perfectly balanced.
First up, the 80‑10‑10 principle is your force-distribution blueprint. Visualize that 80% of your applied force should be focused on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because this is where the highest concentration of nerve endings makes the area extremely sensitive. The remaining 20% of your force is not wasted; it’s divided evenly, so that 10% goes to the mid‑depth area (roughly 3 to 5 inches) and 10% is applied to the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an ectomorph with an extended asset above 7 inches, this means that while your agility allows for rapid movement, most of your energy must be channeled into that ultra-sensitive shallow zone. The result is a cumulative stimulation that is both intense and evenly distributed.
Next, let’s talk about the Sexual Scientific Process. This is your step-by-step method for refining your technique over time. It starts by defining your goal very clearly—say, you want to maximize the dynamic intensity of your fast-paced hip rotations. With your goal in place, you form a hypothesis; maybe you believe that a slightly faster rotation will boost cumulative stimulation, or that a more pronounced change in direction during the rotation will deliver a more effective massage. Then comes tracking. In this phase, you perform about 30 repetitions for each directional movement while keenly observing your body’s feedback (ensuring your core and pelvic floor are engaged) and, even more importantly, listening to her responses—her deep, rhythmic breathing, subtle posture shifts, and soft verbal cues. Tracking serves as your immediate feedback loop so you know exactly which aspects of your stroke are hitting the sweet spots.
Once you’ve gathered enough feedback from tracking, you naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical state where every micro‑movement—from your controlled forward push to the rapid, precise hip rotations—happens automatically, seamlessly, and in perfect rhythm. When you’re in flow, you no longer have to think about each movement; your body performs them with the exact pressure and timing that tracking has helped you optimize. This natural, unbroken rhythm is how cumulative stimulation builds effectively with every repetition.
Finally, let’s discuss the tap keystroke drill—a foundational exercise for ensuring lateral precision. Picture yourself in a strong, stable forearm plank; then, slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, and return smoothly to center. While it might seem like a simple movement, this drill develops the muscle memory and pelvic strength essential for executing every lateral shift with pinpoint accuracy. When practiced with deep, controlled “stroke breathing” and integrated with kegeling exercises, the tap keystroke ensures that every lateral move aligns flawlessly with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
So, brother, to recap: the 80‑10‑10 principle focuses 80% of your force on the shallow, sensitive zone, leaving 10% each for the mid‑depth and deep zones; the Sexual Scientific Process—with goal-setting, hypothesis formation, tracking, and flow—guides you to refine your technique continuously; and the tap keystroke drill builds the lateral precision necessary for cumulative, balanced stimulation. With these core elements in place, you’re ready to break down the Tambor Stroke into its fundamental components and master each keystroke with scientific precision.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Tambor Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Tambor Stroke into each deliberate movement, creating a step-by-step blueprint that you can follow to achieve cumulative, precise stimulation. The Tambor Stroke is performed in the classic missionary position—on top in a modified plank with your knees on the canvas, and your penis inserted at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Once inserted, you choose to operate the stroke in one of two modes: going right or going left. Each mode uses fast-paced hip rotations to create rapid, cumulative stimulation.
Start with the foundation: the forward push. From your anchored position, drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head with a smooth, deliberate push. Feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because you’re operating in the 5‑7‑inch range, the 80‑10‑10 principle instructs you to concentrate about 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra-sensitive zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), with the remaining force split evenly between the mid‑depth and deep areas. This creates a perfectly balanced base for the cumulative effect.
Now, let’s break down the directional phase. For the “Tambor going right” mode, you execute fast-paced hip rotations to the right. In this mode, as you rotate quickly, the hilt of your penis applies pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of the vaginal opening. Simultaneously, the head of your penis rapidly points toward the southwestern wall and then shifts toward the north‑western wall. This swift movement delivers dynamic and cumulative stimulation in rapid succession. Conversely, in the “Tambor going left” mode, the movement is mirrored: the hilt applies pressure as it canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, and the head points first toward the southeastern wall, then shifts toward the north‑eastern wall. With your lean, agile ectomorphic form, these rapid rotations require not only speed but also impeccable precision so that every rotation adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Training the Tambor Stroke involves isolating and drilling these keystrokes until each move becomes automatic. Begin by mastering the forward push with controlled force and smooth motion. Then, move on to drilling fast-paced hip rotations in your chosen direction—practice the “going right” mode, focusing on the rapid movement of the hips so that the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment while the head correctly shifts from the southwestern to the north‑western wall. Next, drill the “going left” mode, mirroring the process. Alternate between these drills, ensuring that every movement is performed swiftly yet with precise control. Throughout, maintain the 80‑10‑10 principle by directing about 80% of your force to the shallow zone and balancing the remainder among the deeper layers.
Each keystroke—from your forward push to each rapid hip rotation—is a building block in the Tambor Stroke. By deconstructing the stroke into these specific elements, you create a comprehensive roadmap that transforms your raw speed and agility into a finely tuned performance, delivering cumulative, intense stimulation every time.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now let’s drill every individual component of the Tambor Stroke until each micro‑movement is as natural as your own breathing. With your lean ectomorphic build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you’re built for rapid, agile actions—but precision is non-negotiable. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and repeat it until it’s ingrained in your muscle memory, making sure to follow the 80‑10‑10 principle and implement the corrected hip rotation details.
Begin with the forward push drill. Get into your modified missionary position, with your knees firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface that suits your lean, agile frame. Carefully insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle, then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Concentrate on the sensation—the top shelf of your extension should glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head stays in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Since your extension is moderate in length, ensure that approximately 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, nerve‑rich area. Repeat this forward push slowly and deliberately until you achieve perfect consistency in your movement.
Next, move into the lateral shift drills. Start with a left lateral shift. From your forward push position, slowly shift your entire body to the left in a deliberate, controlled manner. Focus on an even shift of weight; feel your hilt maintain steady pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening as your shaft rotates to deliver broad, rhythmic pressure to her right wall. As you execute this left shift, integrate the correct hip rotations—perform 2 slow rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, with the head moving from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall. Drill this motion repetitively until it becomes automatic.
Then, practice the right lateral shift drill. Move your body slowly to the right—feel the hilt apply consistent pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates to deliver broad, rhythmic pressure toward her left wall. Integrate 2 slow right hip rotations, ensuring that the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, with the head shifting from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. Alternate these lateral shifts until you can transition seamlessly between left and right while maintaining the 80‑10‑10 force distribution.
Now, add the “double down” element. On the left side, after executing a standard lateral shift, lower your body further in a controlled, deliberate manner to perform a left double down. Focus on intensifying the pressure—feel the hilt deliver additional, concentrated force to the left side while your shaft continues its broad, consistent movement toward her right wall, amplifying the cumulative stimulation. Drill this double down slowly until you achieve precise control of the extra force. Then, mirror this movement on the right side—execute a right shift followed by a right double down, ensuring both sides are equally refined. Aim for at least 30 repetitions per drill until every micro‑movement is fully ingrained in your muscle memory.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing. Each deep inhale prepares you for the next precise movement, while every controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions. Additionally, integrate the tap keystroke drill into your practice—assume a stable forearm plank, then slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the surface, then return to center. This drill further hones your lateral precision and ensures every movement adheres perfectly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to bring all the drilled components together into one continuous, seamless performance—the full Tambor Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your entire focus on linking every micro‑movement into a rhythmic, uninterrupted cycle. In this integrated sequence, you’ll combine your smooth, deliberate forward push with your rapid, precise hip rotations and dynamic lateral shifts to create a stroke that delivers fast-paced, cumulative stimulation.
Begin with a deliberate forward push. Insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region, with the head maintaining constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push is your foundation—ensuring that, as dictated by the 80‑10‑10 principle, about 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, sensitive zone.
Immediately after the forward push, choose your directional mode. If operating in the “Tambor going right” mode, transition into fast-paced hip rotations to the right. Execute rapid, controlled rotations: feel the hilt apply pressure and canvas from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head rapidly points toward the southwestern wall then shifts to the north‑western wall. Alternatively, if you opt for the “Tambor going left” mode, execute fast-paced rotations to the left—where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment and the head transitions from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall. In both modes, every rapid rotation must maintain the 80‑10‑10 force distribution, ensuring that your intense, fast-paced movements continue to direct 80% of your power to the shallow, sensitive area while balancing the deeper touch.
Throughout the integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale fuels the next rapid rotation, and every controlled exhale ensures a smooth transition between the forward push and the fast-paced directional hip rotations. With each complete cycle, your Tambor Stroke becomes a continuous, fluid performance that transforms your natural ectomorphic agility and extended reach into a finely tuned, cumulative display of rapid, intense stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase of your Tambor Stroke training—this is where every micro‑movement is refined until your performance becomes a flawlessly tuned masterpiece of rapid, cumulative stimulation. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, every detail is crucial when executing fast-paced hip rotations. The 80‑10‑10 principle is your constant guide: approximately 80% of your force must target the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, with the remaining force evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you perform your integrated sequence, focus intently on the quality of each move. During your forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When executing your rapid hip rotations—whether going right or left—observe how the hilt and head distribute pressure along her vaginal walls. This is where tracking becomes indispensable—each repetition offers immediate, real-time feedback. Listen carefully for her deep, rhythmic breathing, watch for any subtle changes in her posture, and be attuned to soft verbal cues indicating which aspects of your stroke are most effective. Tracking provides you with the information needed to make small adjustments on the fly.
Once you’ve gathered sufficient data—aim for around 30 repetitions per directional mode—you’ll naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that magical condition where every fast, precise rotation, every forward push, and every lateral shift happens seamlessly, automatically, and in perfect harmony. In flow, you consistently deliver the precise intensity and timing that tracking has refined, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with each cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is crucial throughout: every deep inhale prepares you for the next rapid rotation, and every deliberate exhale smooths the transitions between components. And if any lateral motion seems off—even by a fraction—pause, track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is perfect.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to craft your personalized practice routine—a disciplined, structured training program that reinforces every aspect of your Tambor Stroke while also strengthening your core and overall stability. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, your inherent speed and precision are prime assets, and this routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that consistently delivers rapid, cumulative stimulation.
First, set up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are minimized and your focus is 100% on your technique. Every training session should start with an extensive warm‑up tailored to your ectomorphic body. Engage in dynamic stretches targeting your core, hips, and lower back—these muscle groups form the foundation of your stability and control, ensuring every micro‑movement is executed with precision. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the explosive drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a positive, determined tone for the session.
Next, move into specialized drills beginning with the tap keystroke drill. Assume a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that supports your lean, agile frame. Practice controlled lateral taps: slowly shift your body until your hip gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. With your moderate extension, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint precision. Synchronize each shift with deep, deliberate breathing—inhaling deeply before each movement and exhaling slowly during the return. Integrate kegeling exercises with every repetition to further strengthen your pelvic floor and enhance control. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke drill becomes second nature.
Once you’ve mastered the tap keystroke, integrate it with your forward push and fast-paced hip rotation drills. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by drills for rapid hip rotations in your chosen directional mode. Focus on executing these fast-paced rotations quickly and precisely—ensuring that the hilt canvasses from the correct segment (north‑eastern to south‑eastern when going right, or north‑western to south‑western when going left) and that the head shifts accurately. Drill these combined movements repeatedly until every transition is smooth and your technique consistently adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Supplement your training with targeted core-strengthening exercises—such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills—as your core is the anchor that ensures every movement is executed with laser precision. Finally, maintain a detailed training journal where you record every session, noting the number of repetitions, any adjustments, and her feedback. This journal is an essential part of the Sexual Scientific Process, allowing you to track progress and continually refine your technique until perfection is achieved.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—the apex of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Tambor Stroke converges into one seamless, continuous performance. In this final module, your lean, agile ectomorphic build and moderate extension merge in a rhythmic, cumulative display of intimate mastery that is both scientifically refined and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with absolute, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified plank—with your knees firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface, your core engaged, and your mind fully locked onto precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that around 80% of your force is channeled to the shallow, nerve‑rich zone while the rest is meticulously balanced to provide cumulative stimulation deeper inside.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your chosen hip. Slowly lower your hip in a measured, deliberate lateral shift until it gently taps the supporting surface, then return to center. Focus intently on the sensation—observe how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening, and watch your shaft rotate so its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. Incorporate the correct hip rotations here: if shifting to the left, perform 2 slow rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment (with the head shifting from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall); if shifting to the right, execute 2 slow rotations where the hilt travels from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment (with the head moving from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall). If any lateral movement feels off—if the pressure isn’t perfectly balanced or the angle needs a slight tweak—pause, isolate that movement, and drill it until your internal signals and her subtle cues confirm perfect alignment.
Then, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position and allows you to gather precise internal feedback. As you push upward, contract your core and engage your pelvic floor, and listen attentively for her responses—her deep, steady breathing and any soft, affirming cues will indicate if you’re delivering the optimal stimulation. If you sense that the cumulative effect isn’t quite at its peak, make small, mindful adjustments—perhaps tweaking your lateral angle or adjusting the pace of your forward push—and track these changes with the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your adjustments, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps with correct hip rotations, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one rhythmic, unified performance. Then mirror this complete cycle on the opposite side, ensuring that cumulative stimulation is delivered evenly throughout her entire vaginal canal. The ultimate goal is to achieve a state of natural flow—a condition where every movement occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve this, your Tambor Stroke will transform into a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers the precise, targeted stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every rapid hip rotation, every lateral shift, and every micro-adjustment is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your naturally lean, agile ectomorphic build and your extension between 5 and 7 inches will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Tambor Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Tambor Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
