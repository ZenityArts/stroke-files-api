Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformative journey with the Batchata Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and it’s an honor to guide you through this program developed especially for endomorphs with a penis in the 5 to 7‑inch range. Your body is built for power and endurance—a robust, full‑figured frame that gives you a solid, rock‑steady base. Even though your extension is moderate, every inch of it carries significant sensitivity when directed with precision. Today, we’re going to learn how to channel your immense natural power into a highly controlled, cumulative Batchata Stroke that delivers balanced, focused stimulation to your partner.
Imagine stepping into your personal training space—a quiet sanctuary free of distractions where your sole focus is on your technique. Feel the solid, supportive floor beneath your feet, mirroring the steadfast strength of your endomorphic build. Take a moment and let a few deep, measured breaths fill you with energy; with each exhale, release any tension that could hinder your performance. This space is your arena, brother—a place where your raw power is refined into a work of intimate art.
We begin by adapting the classic missionary position to perfectly suit your full‑figured structure. Start by assuming a modified plank position with your knees firmly anchored on a sturdy surface engineered to support your weight and power. This foundational stance is essential because it anchors your entire body, allowing every micro‑movement—from the subtle sway of your hips to the full‑body lateral shifts—to be executed with deliberate control. Your robust structure requires that each shift and each pressure point be managed with careful precision so that your powerful force is directed exactly where it counts.
Once your foundation is set, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This deliberate insertion is your blueprint; it establishes the precise angles and pressure points that will govern every subsequent movement. Your journey begins with a smooth, deliberate forward push. As you gradually drive your entire body forward toward her head, you feel the top shelf of your moderate extension glide gently over her clitoral region, while the head stays in constant, intentional contact with her “south wall.” Since your extension is in the 5‑7‑inch range, you must concentrate roughly 80% of your applied force on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone (the first 1 to 3 inches) while evenly distributing the remaining 20% between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This precise control of force is the essence of the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that each motion builds cumulative, balanced stimulation.
After establishing that forward push, the Batchata Stroke unfolds into its signature full‑body rocking phase. Here, your entire body comes into play as you generate cumulative stimulation through deliberate, rhythmic lateral movements. The movement pattern follows a specific sequence: for example, you might shift to the left, then to the right, then shift left again, and finally execute a “double down” on the left to intensify the pressure. After this left-side sequence, you mirror the process on the opposite side—shifting right, then left, then right, followed by a right double down. When you shift to the left, your full body moves laterally in a controlled, steady manner. The hilt of your penis applies consistent pressure against the left segment of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates so it points toward her right wall, delivering broad, massaging pressure. The “double down” is a controlled additional lowering of your body on that side to amplify the stimulation further. This rhythmic “W” pattern is the heart of the Batchata Stroke, transforming your raw, powerful energy into precisely directed cumulative pleasure.
This introduction lays your foundation, brother. It shows you how to prepare your environment, adopt the proper posture, and harness your inherent endomorphic strength into a Batchata Stroke that is both powerful and controlled. Welcome, brother—today, we begin turning your raw potential into a masterful, cumulative performance that brings deep, balanced pleasure to your partner.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Alright, brother, now let’s delve into the technical pillars that support your Batchata Stroke. These key elements will transform your raw power into a precisely controlled performance that builds cumulative, balanced stimulation. We’ll cover the 80‑10‑10 principle, the Sexual Scientific Process (complete with tracking and flow), and the tap keystroke drill—each explained in detail so nothing is left ambiguous.
First off, the 80‑10‑10 principle serves as your force-distribution blueprint. Essentially, around 80% of your applied force should be concentrated on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because that’s where the majority of sensitive nerve endings are located, delivering the highest intensity of stimulation. The remaining 20% is distributed evenly so that 10% goes to the mid‑depth area (approximately 3 to 5 inches) and 10% is dedicated to the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, an endomorph with a moderate extension in the 5‑7‑inch range, this means your robust power must be primarily focused on that ultra-sensitive shallow area, while still adding a gentle, balanced touch to deeper regions. This precise allocation of force ensures that every movement builds cumulative stimulation in a well-balanced manner.
Next, the Sexual Scientific Process is our structured method for continually refining your technique. It starts by clearly defining your goal—say, maximizing the rocking friction during your lateral shifts or fine-tuning the pressure during your double downs. Once your goal is set, you form a hypothesis; for instance, you might suspect that a slightly slower lateral shift could enhance the cumulative stimulation. Then comes tracking. Tracking is your immediate feedback loop—perform around 30 repetitions on each “wall” of her vaginal canal while closely observing your internal sensations (ensuring your core is engaged and your pelvic floor is activated) and, more importantly, her responses. Listen attentively to her deep, rhythmic breathing; note any subtle changes in her posture; and be open to soft verbal cues that indicate which movements are especially effective. Tracking lets you adjust your technique in real time for maximum effect.
After you’ve gathered sufficient feedback, you enter a state of flow. Flow is that magical state where every micro‑movement—from your forward push to each lateral shift and double down—occurs automatically and harmoniously. In flow, your stroke becomes a continuous sequence of perfect movements, each one delivering the precise pressure and timing that tracking has helped you fine-tune. The result is a seamless performance where cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly, propelling her towards climax.
Finally, the tap keystroke drill is a fundamental exercise for sharpening your lateral precision. Picture yourself in a solid forearm plank; then, shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, and return smoothly to center. This seemingly simple move builds the muscle memory and pelvic strength necessary for each lateral shift, ensuring that every movement is executed with pinpoint accuracy. When performed in sync with deep, controlled “stroke breathing” and integrated with kegeling, the tap keystroke drill guarantees that all your lateral shifts consistently adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
So, brother, to wrap it up: the 80‑10‑10 principle provides the roadmap for distributing your force with 80% focused on the shallow, sensitive zone and the remaining 20% evenly divided; the Sexual Scientific Process lets you set goals, form hypotheses, track real-time feedback, and ultimately reach a state of flow where your movements are automatic; and the tap keystroke drill is your essential tool for achieving lateral precision. With these principles firmly in place, you’re ready to deconstruct the Batchata Stroke into its fundamental components and master your technique.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Batchata Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Batchata Stroke into every detailed, deliberate movement so you have a complete, step-by-step blueprint for executing it perfectly. The Batchata is a full‑body, rocking stroke that uses controlled lateral shifts to massage the vaginal canal with cumulative, balanced pressure. As an endomorph with a compact extension below 5 inches, your task is to harness your robust, stable power and channel it into deliberate, precisely executed moves that maximize cumulative stimulation without overwhelming her delicate, nerve‑rich areas.
You begin in the modified missionary position: your knees are firmly planted on the canvas, and your penis is inserted at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This initial setup is your blueprint; it sets the exact angles and pressure points that will dictate every subsequent movement and ensure strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
The stroke kicks off with a smooth, deliberate forward push. As you push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head, feel how the top shelf of your compact extension glides softly over her clitoral region, while your head maintains constant, targeted contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is compact (below 5 inches), you’re required to direct about 80% of your force to that shallow, ultra-sensitive zone (the first 1 to 3 inches) and distribute the remaining 20% evenly to the mid‑depth and deep areas. This is the foundation of cumulative stimulation.
Immediately following the forward push, you enter the lateral phase—a dynamic, full‑body movement that forms the core of the Batchata Stroke. Begin by executing a full‑body lateral shift to the left. As you shift left, your entire body moves laterally in a controlled, deliberate manner. The hilt of your penis applies steady pressure to the left segment of her vaginal opening, while your shaft rotates to point toward her right wall, delivering broad, massaging pressure. Now, here’s the corrected detail for the hip rotations: when shifting to the left, if you incorporate hip rotations, perform 2 slow hip rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment of her vaginal opening; during this rotation, the head first points toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall. This refined motion directs the stimulation accurately.
After the left shift (with the integrated hip rotation), you transition immediately into a right lateral shift. Now, your body moves laterally to the right, so that the hilt applies steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your shaft rotates so it points toward her left wall, delivering broad, rhythmic pressure. For a right lateral shift that includes hip rotations, perform 2 slow rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, with the head initially directed toward the southwestern wall and then shifting to the north‑western wall.
This alternating pattern—left shift followed by right shift—creates the rhythmic “W” pattern that is the backbone of the Batchata Stroke, ensuring cumulative stimulation is delivered evenly across her entire vaginal canal.
To amplify the effect further, you integrate a “double down.” After a standard lateral shift on one side (say, left), you lower your body further in a controlled, deliberate manner—this is the double down. Here, the hilt applies additional, intensified pressure to the left part of her vaginal opening, while your shaft continues its broad, cumulative pressure toward her right wall, significantly enhancing the overall stimulation. Once the left sequence with double down is complete, mirror the process on the right side with a right shift followed by a right double down.
Every individual movement—the forward push, each lateral shift, every precise hip rotation, and the controlled double down—is a keystroke in the Batchata Stroke. The controlled, rhythmic rocking of your hips, as dictated by these movements, builds cumulative stimulation in a balanced way, ensuring that about 80% of your force is always focused on the shallow, highly sensitive zone. This detailed deconstruction provides you with a complete and precise roadmap for your performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each individual component of the Batchata Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural and automatic as your own breathing. With your robust endomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, precision and control are your keys to success. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and practice them repeatedly until they’re deeply ingrained in your muscle memory—always keeping in mind the 80‑10‑10 principle and the corrected details for hip rotations.
Begin with the forward push drill. Get into your modified missionary position with your knees firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface, one that can handle your solid, full‑figured form. Carefully insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle, and then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation: the top shelf of your compact extension should glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is compact, make sure that about 80% of your force is focused on that shallow, sensitive zone. Perform this forward push slowly and deliberately until every movement is smooth, controlled, and consistent.
Next, progress to your lateral shift drills. Start with a left lateral shift: from your forward push position, shift your entire body to the left in a slow, controlled motion. Concentrate on the movement—feel the hilt press steadily against the left side of her vaginal opening, while your shaft rotates to deliver broad, rhythmic pressure toward her right wall. Incorporate the correct hip rotation details: as you shift left, execute 2 slow hip rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, with the head moving from the southeastern to the north‑eastern wall. Drill this movement repeatedly until it becomes second nature.
Then, practice the right lateral shift in a similar fashion. Move your body deliberately to the right—feel your weight shift smoothly as the hilt applies consistent pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening and your shaft rotates to provide broad pressure toward her left wall. As you execute this shift, incorporate 2 slow hip rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, with the head initially pointing toward the southwestern wall and then shifting to the north‑western wall. Alternate these lateral shifts until you can transition seamlessly between left and right while maintaining the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Now add the “double down” element. On the left side, after completing a standard left shift, lower your body further in a controlled, deliberate manner to perform a left double down. Focus on intensifying the pressure—feel the hilt apply extra force to the left part of her vaginal opening while your shaft continues its broad, massaging touch toward her right wall, amplifying the cumulative effect. Drill this double down slowly until you are confident that you can control the extra pressure precisely. Then, mirror this drill on the right side, executing a right double down after a right shift, so that the increased pressure on that side is equally controlled and cumulative. Repeat each drill for at least 30 repetitions until every micro‑movement is firmly engrained in your muscle memory.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, deliberate breathing. Each deep inhale fills you with focus for the next movement, and each deliberate exhale ensures smooth transitions between drills. Additionally, integrate the tap keystroke drill into your practice. Assume a stable forearm plank, then slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the surface before returning to center. This drill hones your lateral precision and reinforces that every movement aligns perfectly with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to bring all the drilled components together into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Batchata Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance, with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core fully engaged, and your focus solely on linking every movement into an uninterrupted rhythmic cycle. In this integrated sequence, you combine the forward push, lateral shifts, hip rotations with the correct details, and double downs into the signature “W” pattern that delivers balanced cumulative stimulation across her entire vaginal canal.
Begin with a deliberate forward push. Insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide gently over her clitoral region, while your head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push sets the foundation, adhering strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle so that around 80% of your force is directed at the shallow, sensitive zone.
Immediately after the forward push, transition into your left-side sequence. Execute a full‑body lateral shift to the left—feel your entire body move in a smooth, controlled motion as the hilt applies consistent pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates to deliver broad, massaging pressure to her right wall. Incorporate the two slow hip rotations during the left shift: let the hilt canvas from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head moves from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall. Then perform a left double down—lower your body further in a controlled manner to intensify the pressure and boost cumulative stimulation. Once the left sequence is complete, reset briefly, and shift your entire body to the right. As you lean right, the hilt now applies steady pressure to the right side of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates to deliver broad, rhythmic pressure toward her left wall. Follow this with a right double down, lowering your body to further intensify the massage on that side. This alternating sequence—left shift with double down, then right shift with double down—forms the rhythmic “W” pattern that is the hallmark of the Batchata Stroke, ensuring balanced cumulative stimulation throughout her vaginal canal.
Throughout the integrated sequence, rely on deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome. Each deep inhale primes you for the next precise movement, and every controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions between components. With every complete cycle, your Batchata Stroke evolves into a continuous, fluid performance that strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle, delivering precisely targeted cumulative stimulation with every repetition.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where every micro‑movement of your Batchata Stroke is refined until your performance becomes a perfectly tuned masterpiece of cumulative stimulation. With your lean, long‑limbed ectomorphic build and compact extension below 5 inches, each detail is paramount. The 80‑10‑10 principle continues to be your guide: roughly 80% of your force must be focused on the ultra-sensitive shallow vaginal zone, while the remaining force is evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep regions.
As you execute your integrated cycle, observe every nuance of your movement. During the forward push, confirm that the top shelf of your extension glides gracefully over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” As you carry out your lateral shifts and double downs, pay careful attention to how the hilt and shaft distribute pressure along her vaginal walls. This is where tracking plays a crucial role—each repetition gives you immediate, real-time feedback. Listen intently to her deep, rhythmic breathing; observe any subtle shifts in her posture; and be alert to soft verbal cues that reveal which movements are providing the most cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your feedback loop that allows you to fine-tune your technique with pinpoint accuracy.
Once you’ve gathered enough data—aim for around 30 repetitions per wall—you’ll naturally transition into a state of flow. Flow is that magical condition where every micro‑movement—from your forward push, through each lateral shift, hip rotation, and double down—occurs seamlessly and automatically. In flow, you consistently deliver the precise pressure and timing that tracking has perfected, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with every cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is essential throughout; every deep inhale energizes you for the next move, and every deliberate exhale ensures smooth transitions. And remember, the tap keystroke drill is always there to hone your lateral precision—if any movement seems even slightly off in pressure or angle, pause, track the feedback, and fine-tune the adjustment. Over time, these continuous refinements will allow your Batchata Stroke to achieve a natural, flawless flow, delivering cumulative stimulation that drives her closer to climax each cycle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to craft your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training program designed to reinforce every aspect of your Batchata Stroke, while simultaneously strengthening your core and overall stability. With your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and a compact extension below 5 inches, you have the perfect blend of strength and agility to execute each move with precision. This routine will transform raw, potent energy into a flawless, repeatable performance that consistently delivers cumulative, precisely targeted stimulation.
Start by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are minimized and your focus is solely on perfecting your technique. Every training session should begin with an extensive warm‑up tailored to your mesomorph body. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these key muscle groups provide the stability and control needed to execute each micro‑movement of the Batchata Stroke. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a determined, positive tone for your session.
Next, move on to specialized drills, starting with the tap keystroke drill. Assume your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface that accommodates your solid, full‑figured build. Practice small, controlled lateral taps—shift your body slowly until your hip gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. With your compact extension, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Synchronize each movement with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale deeply before each shift and exhale slowly as you return to center. Incorporate kegeling exercises with every repetition to further strengthen your pelvic floor and enhance overall control. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke becomes an automatic part of your routine.
Once you have mastered the tap keystroke, integrate it with your forward push and lateral shifts. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral shifts and then a smooth, deliberate backward shuttle. Ensure that every movement adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with approximately 80% of your force consistently directed toward the shallow, sensitive vaginal zone. Drill this complete sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition is smooth and the entire stroke flows naturally. To further enhance stability and precision, supplement your drills with targeted core-strengthening exercises—such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability workouts—since your core is the anchor for every move. Finally, maintain a detailed training journal where you record each session, track the number of repetitions, document adjustments, and capture her feedback. This journal is an indispensable element of the Sexual Scientific Process, helping you continuously refine your technique until it reaches perfection.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—the pinnacle of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Batchata Stroke merges into one continuous, seamless performance. In this final module, your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build combined with your compact extension below 5 inches comes together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of intimate mastery that is scientifically refined and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified plank—with your knees firmly planted on a sturdy surface, your core engaged, and your mind locked onto precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously follow the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force targets the shallow, ultra-sensitive vaginal zone while the remaining 20% is meticulously balanced to engage the deeper layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase on one side by executing the tap keystroke with your chosen hip. Slowly lower your hip in a measured, deliberate lateral shift until it gently taps the supporting surface, then return to center. Focus intently on the sensation—observe how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening, and note how your shaft rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. If any lateral movement feels even slightly off—if the pressure isn’t perfectly balanced or the angle requires a small tweak—pause, isolate that movement, and drill it repeatedly until your internal cues and her subtle feedback confirm that you’re in perfect sync with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you push upward, contract your core and engage your pelvic floor, listening carefully for her responses. Her deep, steady breathing and soft verbal cues will signal if you’re hitting the exact target. If you notice that cumulative stimulation isn’t quite at its peak, make small, mindful adjustments—tweak your lateral angle by a degree or modify the pace of your forward push—and track these refinements meticulously using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your adjustments, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps (with flawless hip rotations), vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one rhythmic, unified performance. Then, mirror the complete cycle on the opposite side, ensuring balanced, cumulative stimulation throughout her entire vaginal canal. The ultimate goal is to reach a state of natural flow—a condition where every movement happens automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve this state, your Batchata Stroke will become a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers precisely targeted cumulative stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance where every forward push, every lateral shift, every double down, and every micro-adjustment is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and compact extension will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Batchata Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure every time. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Batchata Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
