Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Tambor Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to guide you through this program designed especially for endomorphs with an extension between 5 and 7 inches. Your body is built for power and endurance—a robust, full‑figured structure that offers unmatched stability and support. Even though your extension is compact compared to a longer one, every inch of it is incredibly sensitive and, when properly activated, can produce a cumulative effect of explosive pleasure. Today, we’re going to learn how to channel your raw, inherent power into a Tambor Stroke that utilizes fast-paced, precise hip rotations combined with controlled directional movement.
Imagine stepping into your training space—a quiet, undisturbed sanctuary where every distraction is left at the door. Feel the firm, supportive ground beneath you, echoing the steady foundation of your solid, endomorphic frame. Take several deep, deliberate breaths; with each inhale, draw in focused energy into every muscle, and with each exhale, release any tension that might hinder your performance. This space is your personal arena—a place where your raw strength is refined into a carefully choreographed technique that builds cumulative, targeted stimulation.
We begin by adapting the classic missionary position to suit your full‑figured build. Start by assuming a modified plank position with your knees securely planted on a stable surface that can support your substantial mass. This foundational stance anchors your entire body so that every micro‑movement—whether it’s a subtle hip shift or a controlled lateral rotation—is executed with deliberate precision. Your inherent endurance and strength mean that even when you move, you have to focus on controlling every motion so that your powerful force is directed exactly where it yields maximum pleasure without overwhelming her delicate, nerve‑rich zones.
Once your body is secure, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Think of this deliberate insertion as your blueprint—it sets the exact angles and pressure points that will govern your stroke from start to finish. Your journey begins with a smooth, deliberate forward push. As you drive your body forward toward her head, feel the top shelf of your moderate extension glide gently over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, purposeful contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is between 5 and 7 inches, you must concentrate about 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone (the first 1–3 inches) while evenly distributing the remaining 20% between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This precise application of force—our 80‑10‑10 principle—is the cornerstone that allows you to build cumulative stimulation in a balanced, targeted way.
After establishing that forward push, the Tambor Stroke unfolds into its signature phase. At this point, you decide whether to operate the stroke going right or going left. In Tambor going right, you execute fast‑paced hip rotations to the right. During these rapid rotations, the hilt of your penis applies pressure by canvassing from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head quickly points toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall. In the alternative “Tambor going left” mode, the process is mirrored: the hilt applies pressure as it canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head initially points toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. These fast-paced, directional hip rotations demand not only speed but also impeccable control so that the cumulative stimulation builds rapidly and precisely.
This introduction lays the groundwork, brother. It shows you how to prepare your environment, set up your posture, and channel your robust endomorphic strength and compact extension into a Tambor Stroke that transforms raw power into a finely tuned performance. Welcome, brother—today, we begin turning your natural potential into an intimate masterpiece.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Alright, brother, let’s break down the technical framework that underpins the Tambor Stroke. This module merges scientific precision with the art of intimate movement, ensuring every motion is deliberate and cumulative.
Let’s start with the 80‑10‑10 principle. Picture this: about 80% of the force you apply should be concentrated on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1–3 inches from the entrance—because that area has the densest network of nerve endings and is the most sensitive. The remaining 20% of your force is divided evenly, with 10% each going to the mid‑depth zone (roughly 3–5 inches) and the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an ectomorph with an extended asset above 7 inches, this force distribution is critical. But in this program tailored for endomorphs (robust, full‑figured) with a compact extension below 5 inches, your naturally powerful and heavy build means your force output is significant. Thus, you must direct most of that force to the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone while still ensuring a balanced, cumulative touch deeper inside. Every lateral move and every rotation is calibrated to follow this precise blueprint, ensuring that the overall stimulation builds cumulatively without overwhelming any single area.
Next, we have the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic method to refine your technique continuously. It begins by clearly defining your goal; perhaps you aim to maximize the intensity of your fast-paced hip rotations or perfect the pressure during your directional “double down” moves. With your goal set, you form a hypothesis—for instance, you may suspect that a slightly faster hip rotation will enhance cumulative stimulation. Then comes tracking. During tracking, you perform roughly 30 repetitions on each “wall” of your partner’s vaginal canal while paying close attention to your body’s cues (like engaging your robust core and pelvic floor) and, critically, to her responses. Listen carefully to her deep, rhythmic breathing, observe any subtle changes in posture, and catch soft verbal cues that indicate which aspects of your stroke are most effective. Tracking is your immediate feedback loop, allowing you to make real-time adjustments so that your technique is optimized for maximum cumulative effect.
Once tracking has provided sufficient data, you enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical state where every micro‑movement—from your deliberate forward push to each fast-paced hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically as if you were performing a perfectly choreographed dance. In flow, you don’t have to overthink each movement; your body executes them naturally with the precise pressure and timing that tracking has helped you fine-tune. This natural, continuous rhythm is what builds cumulative stimulation effortlessly with every repetition.
Finally, we emphasize the tap keystroke drill—a key exercise for developing the lateral precision essential for your stroke. Picture yourself in a firm forearm plank; then, slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, and then return smoothly to center. This seemingly simple drill builds critical muscle memory and strengthens your pelvic floor, ensuring that every lateral movement is executed with pinpoint accuracy. When practiced with deep, controlled “stroke breathing” and integrated with kegeling, the tap keystroke drill ensures that every component of your lateral movement adheres perfectly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
So, brother, to recap: the 80‑10‑10 principle is your force-distribution blueprint—80% to the shallow, sensitive zone and 10% each to the mid‑depth and deep layers; the Sexual Scientific Process, which includes clear goal-setting, forming hypotheses, tracking feedback, and entering a state of flow, helps you continually refine your technique; and the tap keystroke drill is your indispensable tool for lateral precision. With these core principles firmly in place, you’re ready to break down and master the Tambor Stroke with both speed and cumulative intensity.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Tambor Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Tambor Stroke step by step so you have an exact, comprehensive blueprint for transforming your raw power into rapid, cumulative stimulation. The Tambor is performed in the classic missionary position—with you on top in a modified plank (knees on the canvas) and your penis inserted at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Once inserted, you have the option to operate the stroke in one of two modes: going right or going left. Each mode employs fast-paced hip rotations to generate rapid stimulation.
Start with the foundation: the forward push. From your secure base, drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head with a smooth, deliberate push. Feel the top shelf of your extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head remains in continuous, intentional contact with her “south wall.” Because you’re working with an extension in the 5‑7‑inch range, the 80‑10‑10 principle instructs you to focus roughly 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra-sensitive zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), with the remaining 20% evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This controlled forward push lays the groundwork for the cumulative stimulation that follows.
Now, let’s break down the directional phase. In “Tambor going right,” you execute fast-paced hip rotations to the right. As you rotate rapidly, the hilt of your penis applies pressure, canvassing from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, the head of your penis swiftly points toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall, delivering dynamic, rapid stimulation. On the other hand, in “Tambor going left,” the process is mirrored: the hilt applies pressure as it canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head points first toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall. These rapid rotations must be executed with both speed and precision, ensuring that cumulative stimulation is built effectively, without sacrificing control or neglecting the focused 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Training the Tambor Stroke involves breaking it down into these individual keystrokes and drilling them until they become second nature. Start by mastering the forward push with controlled force and fluid motion. Then, isolate the fast-paced hip rotations: practice the “going right” rotations until you can perform them swiftly—ensuring that the hilt canvasses correctly (from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment) and the head transitions accurately (from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall). Next, practice the “going left” rotations, mirroring that process with identical precision. Alternate these drills until you can execute rapid rotations consistently while maintaining adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Every keystroke—each forward push and every quick hip rotation—is a building block that contributes to the overall cumulative stimulation of the Tambor Stroke.
This step-by-step deconstruction provides you with a detailed roadmap for transforming your ectomorphic agility and moderate extension into a carefully controlled performance that delivers rapid, cumulative stimulation with precision.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now let’s get into the nitty-gritty by drilling each individual element of the Tambor Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with both speed and precision. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you’re built for rapid movement—but every fast-paced rotation must be controlled meticulously. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and drill it repeatedly until it’s fully ingrained in your muscle memory, always maintaining strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle and incorporating the correct hip rotation details.
Begin with the forward push drill. In your modified missionary position with your knees securely planted on a sturdy surface that complements your lean frame, carefully insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle. Then, slowly execute a forward push toward your partner’s head. Focus intently on the sensation—feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region, with the head remaining in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is in the 5‑7‑inch range, concentrate about 80% of your force on the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone. Drill the forward push slowly and deliberately until the motion is uniformly smooth and controlled.
Next, progress to the lateral shift drills. Begin with a right lateral shift drill. From the forward push position, slowly shift your entire body to the right in a controlled, deliberate manner. Concentrate on even weight transfer; feel your hilt deliver consistent pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates to deliver broad, rhythmic pressure to her left wall. As you execute this shift, integrate the correct hip rotations: perform 2 slow rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment while the head transitions from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. Drill this movement repeatedly until it feels automatic.
Then, practice a left lateral shift drill in the same controlled manner. Shift your body smoothly to the left and focus on the hilt pressing consistently along the left side of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates to direct broad pressure toward her right wall. Incorporate 2 slow hip rotations: as you shift left, the hilt should canvas from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, with the head moving from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall. Alternate these lateral shifts until you achieve seamless transition between right and left, ensuring every movement adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Now, add the “double down” element to intensify the effect. On the right side, after completing a standard right shift, lower your body further in a controlled, deliberate manner to perform a right double down. Focus on intensifying the pressure—feel the hilt deliver additional, concentrated force along the right side while your shaft continues its broad, rhythmic massage toward her left wall. Drill this double down slowly until you can control the extra force with precision. Then, mirror the process on the left side—execute a left shift followed by a left double down, ensuring that both sides are equally refined. Aim for at least 30 repetitions per drill until every micro‑movement is securely embedded in your muscle memory.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing. With each deep inhale, let the focused energy build; with each deliberate exhale, ensure seamless transitions between movements. Additionally, integrate the tap keystroke drill into your training. Assume a stable forearm plank, then slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the surface, and return to center. Although it may seem simple, this drill refines your lateral precision and solidifies your adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to integrate all the drills into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Tambor Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance, with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your attention solely on linking every micro‑movement into a rhythmic, uninterrupted cycle. In this integrated sequence, you’ll combine your deliberate forward push with your rapid, controlled hip rotations and dynamic lateral shifts to create a stroke that delivers rapid, cumulative stimulation.
Begin with a deliberate forward push. Insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your extension glide effortlessly over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push lays the critical foundation, ensuring that about 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, sensitive vaginal zone.
Immediately after the forward push, transition into your lateral sequence. For example, if you choose the “Tambor going right” mode, execute rapid hip rotations to the right. In this move, the hilt applies pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment, while the head quickly points from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. Alternatively, if you opt for the “Tambor going left” mode, the process is mirrored: the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head shifts from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall. These rapid, dynamic rotations must maintain the 80‑10‑10 principle so that even at high speed, cumulative stimulation is built effectively.
Throughout the integrated sequence, keep your deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each inhale fuels the rapid movements, and each controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions between the forward push and the fast-paced directional rotations. With every complete cycle, your Tambor Stroke evolves into a continuous, fluid performance that transforms your natural ectomorphic agility and extended reach into a powerful, cumulative expression of stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where we fine-tune every micro‑movement of your Tambor Stroke until your performance becomes a flawlessly executed masterpiece of rapid, cumulative stimulation. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, every detail matters—especially during those fast-paced hip rotations. The 80‑10‑10 principle is your guiding light: about 80% of your force must be aimed at the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone, with the remaining force split evenly between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you perform your integrated sequence, focus intensely on the quality of each move. During your forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region, and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When executing your rapid hip rotations (whether going right or left), watch carefully how the hilt and head distribute pressure along her vaginal walls. This is where tracking becomes indispensable—each repetition provides immediate, real-time feedback. Listen closely to her deep, rhythmic breathing, observe any subtle shifts in her posture, and tune in to soft verbal cues that indicate which elements of your stroke are most effective in building cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your immediate feedback loop, giving you the insight needed to adjust your technique on the fly.
After gathering sufficient data—around 30 repetitions per direction—you’ll naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that magical state in which every movement—from your forward push to each rapid rotation—occurs automatically in perfect rhythm. In this state, you deliver the exact pressure and timing that your tracking has refined, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with each cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is vital: every deep inhale equips you for the next rapid action, while every controlled exhale smooths out the transitions. And remember, if any lateral or rotational movement seems off, pause, re-track her feedback, and make the necessary adjustments until your technique is flawless.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to craft your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training program designed to reinforce every facet of your Tambor Stroke while building the core strength and stability that are essential for your endomorphic build. With your naturally powerful, full‑figured frame and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you have the strength and endurance needed, and this routine will transform your raw power into a flawless, repeatable performance that delivers cumulative, targeted stimulation every time.
Start by establishing your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary free of distractions, where your focus is entirely on perfecting your technique. Every training session should begin with a comprehensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your endomorphic body. Engage in dynamic stretches focusing on your core, hips, and lower back—these crucial muscle groups form the foundation of your stability and control, ensuring every micro‑movement is executed with precision. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle for the rigorous drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a positive, determined tone for the session.
Next, move into specialized drills beginning with the tap keystroke drill. Assume your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that supports your robust build. Practice controlled lateral taps: slowly shift your body until your hip gently taps the surface, and then return smoothly to center. With your extension between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Synchronize each shift with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale deeply before each movement and exhale slowly on the return. Integrate kegeling exercises with every repetition to further strengthen your pelvic floor and enhance control. Aim for at least 30 precise repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke drill is second nature.
Once you’ve mastered the tap keystroke, integrate it with your forward push and rapid hip rotation drills. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by drills for fast-paced hip rotations in your chosen directional mode. Focus on executing these rotations with both speed and precision—the hilt must canvas the correct vaginal segment (north‑eastern to south‑eastern for right rotations, or north‑western to south‑western for left rotations), and the head must shift accurately (from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall for right rotations, or from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall for left rotations). Drill these combined movements repeatedly until every transition is smooth and your technique adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle. To further enhance stability and precision, supplement your practice with core-strengthening exercises like planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills. Finally, keep a detailed training journal—record each session, the number of repetitions performed, any adjustments you experiment with, and her feedback. This journal is a crucial element of the Sexual Scientific Process, helping you track progress and continually refine your technique until perfection is achieved.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—the culmination of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Tambor Stroke merges into one continuous, seamless performance. In this final module, your robust, full‑figured endomorphic build and your extension between 5 and 7 inches come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of intimate mastery that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified plank—with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface, your core fully engaged, and your mind honed for precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, ultra-sensitive vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is meticulously balanced to stimulate the deeper layers.
Immediately, transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your chosen hip. Slowly lower your hip in a measured, deliberate lateral shift until it gently taps the supporting surface, then return smoothly to center. Focus intently on the sensation—observe how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening, and note how your shaft rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. Integrate the correct hip rotations: if shifting to the left, perform 2 slow rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment (with the head shifting from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall); if shifting to the right, execute 2 slow rotations where the hilt moves from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment (with the head transitioning from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall). If any lateral movement seems off—if the pressure isn’t perfectly balanced or the angle requires a slight tweak—pause, isolate that movement, and drill it until both your internal cues and her subtle feedback confirm perfection.
Then, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you push upward, contract your core, engage your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for her responses. Her deep, steady breathing and soft, affirming cues are your guide—if you sense the cumulative stimulation isn’t at its peak, make small, mindful adjustments (perhaps tweak your lateral angle slightly or adjust the pace of your forward push) and carefully track these changes using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps with correct hip rotations, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one rhythmic, unified performance. Then, mirror the complete cycle on the opposite side, ensuring balanced cumulative stimulation throughout her entire vaginal canal. The ultimate goal is to reach a state of natural flow—a condition where every move occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve this state, your Tambor Stroke will transform into a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers the exact, focused stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every rapid hip rotation, every lateral shift, and every microscopic adjustment is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your robust, full‑figured endomorphic build and your extension between 5 and 7 inches will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Tambor Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure every time. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Tambor Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
