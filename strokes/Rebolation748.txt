Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Rebloation Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and it’s my honor to guide you through this program—specifically crafted for ectomorphs like you with a compact extension below 5 inches. Your body is lean and agile, built for speed, precision, and refined control. Even though your asset is compact, every single inch is packed with sensitivity when you use it correctly. Today, we’re going to channel your natural finesse into mastering the Rebloation Stroke—a technique that uses sequential hip rotations to build cumulative, targeted stimulation.
Imagine yourself standing tall in your training space—a quiet, dedicated sanctuary designed exclusively for you where all distractions simply vanish. Feel that firm, supportive ground beneath your feet; it mirrors the stable foundation of your lean ectomorphic build. Take several deep, focused breaths; with every inhale, draw in energy and determination, and with each exhale, let go of any lingering tension. This arena is yours, brother—a space where your raw, streamlined potential is refined into a precisely executed performance that delivers cumulative pleasure with every coordinated movement.
We begin by adapting the classic missionary position to work best with your lean physique. Get into a modified plank position with your knees comfortably on the canvas—a position that channels your agility and allows for fast, responsive movements without compromising stability. This foundational stance is critical; it anchors your body so that every micro‑movement—from the controlled rotation of your hips to the final lateral shift—is executed with deliberate precision. Your lean frame is optimized for rapid, surgical movements, and even with a compact extension, precision is what turns raw potential into cumulative stimulation.
Once you’re securely anchored in your starting position, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Consider this deliberate insertion as your blueprint—it sets the precise orientation and pressure points necessary for the Rebloation Stroke to be effective. Your journey then unfolds in two main phases. First, you perform four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation to the right, the hilt of your penis applies focused pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening down to the south‑eastern segment. During these rotations, the head of your penis first directs its force toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall. This sequential movement isn’t random; it builds cumulative stimulation by repeatedly engaging the most sensitive areas with precision.
Immediately following the right rotations, you transition to a mirrored phase: four individual hip rotations to the left. As you rotate to the left, the hilt of your penis now applies pressure by canvassing from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head initially points toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. Finally, the stroke concludes with one lateral shift to the left—this final movement rounds out the pattern and ensures that cumulative pressure is evenly distributed across her canal.
In this introductory module, our goal is to help you understand the unique structure of the Rebloation Stroke and how it’s designed to build cumulative stimulation through sequential, controlled rotations. Your lean ectomorphic build and compact extension mean that every movement must be executed with rapid precision—speed is your advantage, and precision is your hallmark. Welcome, brother—today marks the first step in transforming your natural agility into a sophisticated stroke that delivers balanced, explosive pleasure with every rotation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, the Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, and Flow
Alright, brother, let’s break down the core principles that form the backbone of your Rebloation Stroke so you know exactly how each element contributes to cumulative, targeted stimulation.
First, the 80‑10‑10 principle is your force‑distribution blueprint. Imagine that when you apply stimulation, 80% of your force should be focused on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because that area is loaded with nerve endings and is the most sensitive zone. The remaining 20% of your force isn’t lost; instead, it’s divided evenly so that 10% is directed to the mid‑depth area (roughly 3 to 5 inches) and 10% is reserved for the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an ectomorph with a compact extension below 5 inches, this means that even though your movements are swift and agile, the bulk of your stimulation must always be concentrated on the ultra‑sensitive shallow area. This precise distribution allows you to build cumulative stimulation while ensuring no one area is overstimulated or desensitized.
Next is the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic, methodical approach to refining your technique. It all begins by clearly defining your goal. For the Rebloation Stroke, your goal might be to maximize the cumulative effect of each individual hip rotation so that every single move adds a layer of precise stimulation. With your goal defined, you then form a hypothesis: perhaps you suspect that a slightly slower rotation will allow for better pressure distribution, or that tweaking the angle of your hips even just a fraction will enhance cumulative stimulation. Then comes tracking. In tracking, you methodically perform about 30 rotations on each “wall” of your partner’s vaginal canal, while paying close attention to your body’s responses. Engage your lean, agile core, activate your pelvic floor, and, most importantly, listen to her feedback—her deep, rhythmic breathing, subtle shifts in posture, and any soft verbal cues provide crucial insight. This immediate feedback loop lets you adjust your technique in real time so that every rotation is optimized to deliver cumulative stimulation.
Once tracking has provided you with enough data, you move into the state of flow. Flow is that almost magical state where every micro‑movement—whether it’s your forward push or each individual hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically. In flow, you’re not consciously planning each move; your body simply executes it with the exact pressure and timing that tracking has helped you refine. Cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly as the entire sequence becomes a natural, rhythmic performance—a perfect blend of speed and precision.
Now, while some strokes like The U Stroke incorporate a separate tap keystroke drill to fine-tune lateral movement, the Rebloation Stroke’s keystrokes are inherent in the hip rotations themselves. Your training here involves isolating and drilling each individual rotation until it becomes second nature. By repeating these rotations—both to the right and the left—until your movements are fluid, you build a level of muscle memory that ensures your technique is consistent and cumulative.
So, in summary, the 80‑10‑10 principle ensures that 80% of your force targets the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone while 10% each is dedicated to the mid‑depth and deep layers; the Sexual Scientific Process—through clear goal setting, hypothesis formation, meticulous tracking, and achieving flow—provides a roadmap for refining your technique; and drilling the individual hip rotations is how you cement the keystrokes of the Rebloation Stroke into your muscle memory. With these core components, you’re equipped to transform your raw, rapid movements into a controlled, cumulative performance that delivers balanced stimulation every time.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Rebloation Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, now we’re going to deconstruct the Rebloation Stroke step by step so that you have a precise blueprint for transforming your raw ectomorphic agility and compact extension into cumulative, targeted stimulation. The Rebloation Stroke is performed in the classic missionary position—you’re on top in a modified plank with your knees on the canvas, and your penis is inserted at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Once inserted, the stroke unfolds in a clear, sequential pattern: you perform four individual hip rotations to the right, then four individual hip rotations to the left, and finally a lateral shift to the left to complete the cycle.
Let’s break this down. First, you begin with a forward push. From your anchored starting position, drive your entire body smoothly and deliberately forward toward your partner’s head. As you push, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide gently over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, intentional contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is below 5 inches, the 80‑10‑10 principle instructs you to focus about 80% of your force on the shallow, sensitive 1 to 3 inches, with the remaining 20% evenly distributed between the mid‑depth and deep areas. This forward push is the foundation—it sets the stage for the cumulative effect that follows.
Now, the stroke enters its directional phase. You start with four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation to the right, the hilt of your penis applies pressure by “canvassing” the vaginal opening, moving from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment. At the same time, the head of your penis shifts its direction—initially pointing toward the southwestern wall and then gradually moving to the north‑western wall with each rotation. These individual rotations are your keystrokes; each one adds a precise layer of stimulation, building cumulatively as you progress through the four rotations.
After completing the rotations to the right, you transition into the mirrored phase: four individual hip rotations to the left. As you rotate to the left, the hilt works in reverse—applying pressure as it canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment. Meanwhile, the head begins by directing its pressure toward the southeastern wall and then shifts toward the north‑eastern wall. This symmetrical pattern ensures that cumulative stimulation is delivered evenly across the entire vaginal opening.
Finally, after completing the bilateral rotations, the stroke concludes with an additional lateral shift to the left. This final shift rounds out the pattern, ensuring that all areas receive the cumulative benefit of your precise rotations. Throughout each component of the stroke, you must adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle. That means every forward push and every individual hip rotation is executed so that approximately 80% of your force is focused on the most sensitive shallow zone, while the remaining force is carefully distributed to the mid‑depth and deep zones to maintain balanced, cumulative stimulation.
This detailed deconstruction gives you a clear, step-by-step roadmap to the Rebloation Stroke—transforming your lean, agile ectomorphic qualities and compact extension into a finely choreographed performance that delivers precise, cumulative pleasure with every repetition.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each component of the Rebloation Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with absolute precision and fluidity. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, you’re built for rapid, responsive movements—but each hip rotation must be controlled down to the finest detail. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and practice it repeatedly until it’s ingrained in your muscle memory, ensuring you always stick to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Begin with the forward push drill. Get into your modified missionary position, ensuring your knees are firmly planted on a supportive surface that suits your lean build. Carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle, then slowly execute a forward push toward your partner’s head. Focus intently on the sensation—feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is compact, direct about 80% of your force on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. Drill this movement slowly and methodically until the push is perfectly smooth and consistent.
Next, work on drilling the individual hip rotations. Start with the right rotations. With your body still in the modified missionary stance, focus on executing one hip rotation to the right. As you rotate, feel the hilt of your penis apply pressure by canvassing from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. At the same time, the head should first point toward the southwestern wall and then shift to the north‑western wall. Perform one rotation slowly, then pause, reset, and repeat this rotation for at least 30 repetitions until the movement becomes ingrained in your muscle memory.
Then, isolate and drill the left hip rotations. Shift your body into a left rotation and focus on executing the rotation with precision—the hilt should canvas smoothly from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head initially points toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall. Again, perform these rotations slowly, pausing between each to internalize the movement, and repeat for at least 30 repetitions until it feels automatic.
After you’ve refined the individual rotations, drill the final lateral shift. This is the move where you shift your body laterally to the left to complete the cycle. Practice moving slowly and deliberately, ensuring the force remains consistent with the 80‑10‑10 principle. Alternate these drills until the transition between the hip rotations and the lateral shift is seamless.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing—inhale deeply to fuel the upcoming movement, and exhale slowly to ensure a smooth reset between repetitions. Unlike other strokes that might employ separate lateral drills, the Rebloation Stroke focuses on these specific hip rotations and the final lateral shift. Repeating each keystroke rigorously builds the precision required to deliver cumulative stimulation effectively.
By drilling each component individually—forward push, right rotations, left rotations, and the lateral shift—you’re creating a strong foundation of muscle memory, ensuring that every micro‑movement becomes automatic and impeccably executed. This dedicated repetition is the key to transforming your raw, agile response into a finely tuned performance that delivers the precise, cumulative stimulation inherent in the Rebloation Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, fluid performance—the complete Rebloation Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance, with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your focus entirely on linking every micro‑movement into an unbroken, rhythmic cycle. In this integrated sequence, you’ll combine your deliberate forward push with the series of four hip rotations to the right, followed by four hip rotations to the left, and then finish with a lateral shift to complete the pattern.
Begin with the forward push. In your steady, anchored position, carefully insert your penis at that controlled downward diagonal angle and then push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head in a smooth, deliberate motion. As you move forward, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, focused contact with her “south wall.” This forward push is essential—it lays the foundation, ensuring that about 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone as dictated by the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Immediately after the forward push, initiate the first phase of the stroke: four individual hip rotations to the right. As you perform these rotations, focus on letting the hilt canvas steadily from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head initially directs pressure toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall with every turn. These four rotations are performed in quick succession, with each rotation adding its layer to the cumulative stimulation.
After completing the right rotations, transition seamlessly to the left. Execute four individual hip rotations to the left—mirroring the process so that the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and the head first points toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. This balanced, alternating rotation creates a rhythmic pattern that ensures cumulative stimulation is evenly delivered throughout the vaginal canal.
Finally, complete the cycle with one decisive lateral shift to the left. This final shift enhances the cumulative effect by ensuring that every area of her canal is engaged, rounding out the stroke with an even distribution of stimulation. Throughout the entire integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale builds energy for the next movement, and every controlled exhale ensures a seamless transition between the forward push, the hip rotations, and the lateral shift.
With every complete cycle, your Rebloation Stroke becomes a continuous, fluid performance that transforms your lean, agile ectomorphic attributes and compact extension into a finely choreographed sequence of cumulative stimulation. This integration is the culmination of meticulous practice and muscle memory, turning each drilled keystroke into an intuitive, seamless performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where every micro‑movement of your Rebloation Stroke is refined until your performance is an automatic, flawless masterpiece of cumulative stimulation. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, every detail matters—especially during those individual hip rotations. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains your guiding light: approximately 80% of your applied force must be focused on the ultra‑sensitive shallow vaginal zone, with the rest evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you execute the integrated sequence, focus deeply on the quality and consistency of every move. During your forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your compact extension glides seamlessly over her clitoral region, and that the head stays in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When performing the four right and four left hip rotations, carefully observe how the hilt canvasses the vaginal opening and how the head shifts its focus with each rotation—first pressing toward one wall and then adjusting to the opposite wall. This is where tracking comes in. Each repetition provides immediate, real‑time feedback. Listen closely to her deep, rhythmic breathing; observe any subtle shifts in her body language; and be highly attuned to soft verbal cues that signal which aspects of your stroke are most effective in building cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your feedback loop that lets you fine‑tune your technique on the fly—adjust your speed, tweak your angle, and modulate your force until every rotation is perfected.
Once you’ve gathered sufficient tracking data—ideally around 30 repetitions per directional phase—you’ll naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical state where every movement—from your forward push to each meticulously executed hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically in perfect rhythm. In flow, you deliver the exact pressure and timing that your tracking has helped you hone, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with every cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is vital in this phase; every deep inhale prepares you for the next movement, and every controlled exhale smooths out the transitions. And if any rotation or lateral shift seems even slightly off, take a moment to re-track her feedback and make small, precise adjustments until your technique is flawless.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now let’s build your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training program that reinforces every element of your Rebloation Stroke while simultaneously strengthening your core and overall stability. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, your natural quickness and precision are key assets. This routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that delivers cumulative, precise stimulation every time.
First, set up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions melt away and your focus is entirely on perfecting your technique. Every session should begin with an extensive warm‑up designed specifically for your ectomorphic body. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these essential muscle groups are the foundation of your stability and control, ensuring that every micro‑movement is executed with precision. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, priming every muscle and joint for the rapid, precise drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a positive, determined tone for the session.
Next, move into your specialized drills, starting with your forward push. Practice the forward push drill in your modified missionary position until every movement is smooth and controlled, ensuring that about 80% of your force is directed to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone. Then, focus on drilling your individual hip rotations—both to the right and to the left. Isolate the right rotations first, performing each rotation slowly and with complete control so that the hilt consistently canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, while the head shifts accurately from the southwestern to the north‑western wall. Do this for at least 30 repetitions until it’s completely ingrained in your muscle memory. Then, mirror the process with left hip rotations until you can execute them flawlessly. Finally, drill the final lateral shift that completes the pattern. Alternate among these drills until each keystroke of the Rebloation Stroke is second nature to you.
Throughout these drills, maintain deep, controlled breathing to support smooth transitions and precise movements. Supplement your practice with core-strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability workouts, because a strong core is essential to control every rapid movement. And be sure to keep a detailed training journal—record every session, the number of repetitions, any adjustments you experiment with, and her feedback. This journal is a critical element of the Sexual Scientific Process; it allows you to track progress and continuously refine your technique until every stroke is perfected.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—the apex of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Rebloation Stroke converges into one continuous, flawless performance. In this final module, your lean, agile ectomorphic build and your compact extension below 5 inches come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of mastery that is both scientifically refined and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified missionary stance—with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core fully engaged, and your mind locked onto precision. Start with a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously follow the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is focused on that ultra‑sensitive shallow zone and the remaining force is balanced to stimulate the deeper layers.
Immediately transition into the hip rotation phase by executing four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation, focus on the hilt applying steady pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment, while the head first directs pressure toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall. Next, seamlessly transition into four individual rotations to the left, where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and the head initially points toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. Finally, complete the sequence with one smooth lateral shift to the left—this final movement ensures that the cumulative stimulation is evenly distributed. Throughout the entire sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale fuels the next precise move, and every controlled exhale smooths the transitions.
If any component feels off—if a rotation is not perfectly executed or the pressure distribution is not balanced—pause and re-track her feedback. Make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is perfectly honed. The ultimate goal is to reach a state of natural flow—a condition where every forward push, every hip rotation, and every lateral shift occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve that state, your Rebloation Stroke will have evolved into a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers targeted, cumulative stimulation.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance where every forward push, every hip rotation, and every lateral shift is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your lean, agile ectomorphic build and compact extension will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Rebloation Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Rebloation Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
