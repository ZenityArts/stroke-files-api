Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to your new journey with the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m excited to work with you, especially because you’re built as a mesomorph—a body type that combines both athletic agility and balanced strength—with a penis size between 5 and 7 inches. Your build gives you the perfect blend of speed, precision, and natural coordination. Today, we’re going to convert that raw athletic power into a meticulously orchestrated stroke that delivers deep, cumulative stimulation.
Imagine this: you’ve set up your training sanctuary in a quiet, comfortable space free of distractions. You settle into the area, taking a few long, slow breaths that clear your mind and allow you to focus solely on developing your technique. This isn’t just physical training; it’s a journey of transformation where your natural athleticism is channeled into a rhythmic and scientific performance. In our session, you begin by modifying the classic missionary position to suit your mesomorphic frame. You get into a modified plank position, with your knees securely planted on a sturdy surface that supports your balanced, muscular body. This foundational posture is critical; it anchors you and ensures that every micro‑movement is executed with deliberate control and precision.
Once you’re steady, you insert your penis at a precise downward diagonal angle into your partner, establishing the proper alignment—the blueprint for every subsequent movement. Your first move is a smooth, measured forward push. As you slowly move your entire body forward toward your partner’s head, the top shelf of your extension glides lightly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your penis is between 5 and 7 inches, it’s important that you concentrate about 80% of your applied force on the shallow vaginal zone—the first one to three inches where nerve endings are densest. This is balanced with 10% of your force engaging the mid‑depth and 10% engaging the deep regions. This focused distribution of force is the essence of the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring every stroke stimulates the most sensitive area while keeping overall pressure balanced.
Next, you transition into the lateral phase. Thanks to your natural mesomorph coordination, you have excellent lateral agility. On one side, you slowly drop your left hip toward the surface. As your hip lowers, the hilt—the base of your penis—applies steady, focused pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, and your penis rotates so that its inner surface is directed to the right. This creates controlled friction, generating a gentle, upward rocking massage that travels along her right wall. After completing the left‑side sequence, you mirror the exact same sequence on the right side. This dual‑phase (douplo) structure is designed to ensure that both sides of the vaginal canal receive equal, cumulative stimulation in a graceful “W” pattern.
In this introduction, you’re beginning to harness your natural athletic ability and channel it through a scientifically refined process that maximizes pleasure in a balanced, deliberate manner. Every forward push, every lateral movement, and every controlled reset is designed to target the key sensitive areas with precision. Welcome, brother—let’s transform your raw potential into a masterful, intimate expression with the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Let’s dig into the core principles that underpin every movement in your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. First, consider the 80‑10‑10 principle as your blueprint for optimal stimulation. Essentially, you concentrate about 80% of your applied force on the shallow vaginal zone—the first one to three inches where there are the most nerve endings and the highest sensitivity. The remaining 20% of your energy is divided equally so that 10% engages the mid‑depth area (roughly three to five inches) and 10% targets the deep zone (beyond five inches). This ensures that every forward push, every lateral shift, and every reset is carefully calibrated to stimulate where it counts most, without overdoing the deeper areas. For you, this means focusing your power on delivering intense stimulation to that critical shallow zone while still keeping overall contact balanced across the canal.
Next, we have the Sexual Scientific Process, which is our method for constant refinement. This process is like a series of experiments. First, you clearly define your goal—maybe you want to maximize friction along a specific part of the vaginal wall during your lateral movements. Then, you form a hypothesis; based on your practice, you might decide that altering your hip drop angle slightly could increase the cumulative effect. The next step is tracking: you systematically perform a high number of repetitions—aim for around 30 strokes on each “wall”—paying close attention to how your core feels, how your pelvic floor responds, and how your partner reacts through her breathing, subtle movements, or verbal feedback. Finally, once you’ve analyzed the data, you commit to the optimal pattern—a state we call flow. In flow, your strokes become automatic, fluid, and perfectly rhythmic, ensuring the 80‑10‑10 distribution is consistently maintained.
Tracking means being deeply in tune with each repetition. It’s all about gathering feedback—both from your body and your partner’s responses—so that you can pinpoint precisely what adjustments are needed. And flow is when all these refined movements come together naturally, allowing your stroke to become a continuous, unbroken sequence of cumulative stimulation.
An essential drill in all of this is the tap keystroke. This is a simple but effective exercise where you start in a stable position, often a forearm plank, and then shift laterally until your hip gently “taps” the supporting surface before returning to center. It’s a minimal, controlled movement that builds muscle memory and strengthens your pelvic floor. When practiced with deep, synchronized breathing (stroke breathing) and kegeling, the tap keystroke ensures that every lateral movement in your stroke is executed with pinpoint precision—an absolute must for achieving cumulative stimulation.
With the 80‑10‑10 principle guiding the precise targeting of stimulation, the Sexual Scientific Process providing a framework for continuous improvement, and the tap keystroke drill honing your lateral control, you have the complete toolkit you need for the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. These core principles ensure that every micro‑movement is deliberate, balanced, and effective. With this foundation thoroughly understood, we can now break down the stroke into its fundamental components.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Now, brother, let’s break down the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into the individual movements you’ll need to master. This stroke is executed in two distinct phases: first, you perform the entire sequence on the left side, and then you mirror that exact process on the right side to achieve balanced stimulation. As a mesomorph with a penis between 5 and 7 inches, your naturally balanced, athletic build allows you to execute dynamic, precise movements, while your moderate extension demands that every micro‑movement be meticulously controlled to focus cumulative stimulation on the most sensitive areas.
Let’s begin with the left‑side sequence. You start by inserting your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Then, you execute a smooth forward push by moving your entire body slowly northward toward her head. As you move forward, the top shelf of your extension glides gently over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” In this phase, the 80‑10‑10 principle is key: roughly 80% of your force is focused on the shallow vaginal zone, ensuring that the most sensitive area receives the maximum stimulation.
Immediately after the forward push, you enter the lateral phase on the left. Slowly, deliberately, you drop your left hip toward the canvas. As you lower your hip, the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening. At the same time, your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, creating friction that produces a gentle, upward rocking massage along her right wall, spanning from the eastern section upward toward the northern region. This lateral drop is executed using the tap keystroke, ensuring that the movement is minimal and controlled, keeping the stimulation focused on the shallow zone.
Right after the lateral drop, you smoothly raise your left hip back to center. This controlled reversal shifts the applied force from the lateral extreme to a more centralized position. As you raise your hip, the hilt now applies pressure from the western section upward toward the northern portion of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients to point straight north—resulting in an upward massage along her northern wall toward the eastern wall. This integration of movement is critical, as it resets the stimulation before you repeat the cycle. You then repeat the left‑side sequence several times, and you may introduce slight variations in pace—perhaps a quicker, half‑raise before a full drop—to dynamically modulate the friction and cumulative stimulation. This rhythmic “W” pattern builds intensity with each repetition, all while strictly adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Once you’ve fully executed the left‑side sequence, you immediately mirror the same series of moves on the right side. You begin again with a forward push identical to the left‑side movement—ensuring that the top shelf glides over her clitoral region with the same level of consistent contact at the “south wall.” Then, you initiate the right‑side lateral phase by slowly dropping your right hip. In this mirror movement, the hilt applies consistent pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left, thereby generating friction and a gentle rocking massage along her left wall. Following the drop, you raise your right hip back to center in a controlled manner to reset the stimulation. Repeating this right‑side sequence several times ensures that the overall effect is balanced and cumulative across both sides of the vaginal canal.
The complete Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke is achieved when you seamlessly combine the left‑side and right‑side sequences, creating a dual‑phase “W” pattern that delivers targeted, cumulative stimulation according to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Each micro‑movement is carefully calibrated so that every forward push, lateral drop, and hip raise builds upon the previous one, ensuring optimal stimulation of the sensitive shallow zone while keeping the overall performance balanced and effective.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Now it’s time, brother, to drill each component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as your own breath. With your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, precision and consistency are absolutely key. In this module, we’ll work on each phase in isolation and then in combination, ensuring every repetition adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Begin by assuming your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a sturdy, supportive surface that reinforces your balanced, muscular frame. Insert your penis at the precise downward diagonal angle, and then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation: feel the top shelf of your extension gliding gently over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is moderate, about 80% of your applied force must target the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. Repeat this forward push slowly and deliberately until the movement is smooth, controlled, and fully consistent.
Next, move on to the left‑side lateral tap drill using the tap keystroke. From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a controlled lateral movement until your hip gently taps the supporting surface. Visualize how the hilt applies targeted, steady pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, delivering a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along her right wall. Coordinate each lateral tap with deep, controlled breathing—inhale deeply before initiating the movement and exhale slowly as you complete it. Incorporate kegeling exercises with every tap to bolster your precision. Drill this lateral tap movement repeatedly for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on the left side until the movement is second nature.
Then, mirror this drill on the right side. From your forward position, carefully drop your right hip until it gently taps the surface, then return to center with smooth control. Visualize the hilt delivering steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left, creating a similar rhythmic rocking massage along her left wall. Synchronize this mirrored lateral tap with deep breathing and integrate kegeling for added precision. Perform this movement for at least 30 repetitions until it becomes fully ingrained.
After perfecting your lateral drills, focus on the hip lowering and backward shuttle. Following each lateral tap, slowly lower your dropped hip until it gently contacts the supporting surface—allowing the underbelly of your penis to apply cumulative, controlled pressure on her lower wall while the upper shelf maintains contact with her upper wall. Finally, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle—retract your body in a controlled manner so that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall as you reset your position without fully withdrawing. Repeat this full sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times on both sides until every transition is smooth and every micro‑movement consistently adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, deliberate breathing. Each deep inhale should prime your body for the next precise movement, and every controlled exhale must ensure a seamless transition between phases. With disciplined, consistent practice, your natural mesomorph precision and balanced extension will become flawlessly integrated into every movement of the stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all of the drilled components into a continuous, seamless performance—a hallmark of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, your core fully engaged, and your mind laser‑focused on creating a fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this phase, you will merge your forward push, left‑side lateral taps (executed via the tap keystroke), controlled left‑side hip raises, and the backward shuttle into one unified rhythmic cycle. Immediately after completing the left‑side sequence, you mirror the same exact sequence on the right side, producing a balanced, dual‑phase “W” pattern that covers the entire vaginal canal.
Begin by initiating a forward push—insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you do this, ensure that the top shelf of your extension consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push lays the foundation of your performance and is executed with strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle, focusing about 80% of your force on the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase on the left side. Execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip using the tap keystroke. Concentrate on the sensation as the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening and your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along her right wall. Once the left‑side taps are complete, smoothly raise your left hip back to center to reset the pressure, then perform a deliberate backward shuttle to return to your starting position, ensuring that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall throughout.
Without delay, mirror the same sequence on the right side. From your starting position, execute another forward push (maintaining the same 80‑10‑10 force distribution), then perform three controlled lateral taps by dropping your right hip until it gently taps the surface. Visualize the hilt applying steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left, creating a rhythmic rocking massage along her left wall. Once these right‑side taps are complete, raise your right hip back to center, then execute a controlled backward shuttle to reset your position.
This alternating “walking” motion—a left‑side sequence followed by a right‑side mirrored sequence—creates the rhythmic “W” pattern that defines the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke, ensuring that stimulation is balanced and cumulative across the entire vaginal canal. Every micro‑movement, from the forward push to the lateral taps, and every hip raise and backward shuttle, is executed in strict accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated sequence, let your deep, rhythmic breathing be your internal metronome—each inhale primes you for the next movement, and each exhale ensures smooth, seamless transitions. With every complete cycle, your natural mesomorph precision and balanced extension merge into one continuous, fluid Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke that is scientifically refined and intimately effective.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. Now our focus shifts to fine‑tuning every micro‑adjustment so that your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every movement must be executed with impeccable precision. Remember, the 80‑10‑10 principle dictates that about 80% of your force is directed to the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep areas.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, pay close attention to every nuance. During the forward push, check that the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you perform your lateral taps (using the tap keystroke) on both sides, observe the gentle rocking motions produced by your controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even a slight variation—say, a one or two degree change in your hip drop angle or a subtle alteration in pace—can significantly impact the cumulative stimulation. Experiment with these minor adjustments and watch carefully how they affect the pressure and rocking effect. Listen to her feedback: her deep, rhythmic breathing, soft verbal cues, and any subtle body shifts are priceless data that you can use to refine your technique further. This iterative process of defining goals, forming hypotheses, tracking the outcomes, and continuously refining your technique is at the very heart of our Sexual Scientific Process.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout each cycle. Each deep inhale helps prime your body for the next precise move, and each controlled exhale ensures a seamless transition between phases. Over time, as you consistently monitor your internal signals—like core engagement and pelvic floor contractions—along with her responses, you will enter a state of natural flow. When in flow, every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When this state is achieved, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will be a continuous, rhythmic expression of scientifically optimized stimulation that perfectly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Remember, brother, every tiny adjustment matters. Your athletic mesomorph structure and balanced extension are the perfect foundation for delivering intensely focused stimulation, but only if every micro‑movement is executed with unwavering precision. Continuously track your internal cues and her subtle responses, and refine your technique until your stroke becomes a naturally flowing performance that is both scientifically exact and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to establish your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen that will reinforce every component of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke while simultaneously building the core and overall stability essential for your athletic mesomorph build and balanced extension. This phase is your detailed roadmap for transforming your natural physical abilities into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically optimized stimulation.
First, set up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are minimized and your focus is solely on perfecting your technique. Every session should begin with a comprehensive warm‑up tailored to your mesomorph physiology. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back, as these key muscle groups provide the necessary support for every precise movement in the stroke. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for the training session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target each individual component of the stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position, practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your balanced extension, each lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint precision. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the supporting surface, then return smoothly to center. Synchronize every movement with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale deeply before initiating each shift and exhale slowly upon completion. To enhance precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor with every tap. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the movement becomes fully ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve honed the lateral drills, integrate them with the vertical movements. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a sequence of lateral taps and then a smooth, gradual backward shuttle, ensuring every micro‑movement strictly follows the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this complete sequence repeatedly on both the left and right sides until every transition flows naturally. To further reinforce your stability and precise control, supplement your stroke-specific drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises—such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills—since a strong core is vital for maintaining balance and exact control during your performance. Lastly, keep a detailed training journal where you record every session: note the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you test, and your partner’s feedback. This journal is an indispensable part of the Sexual Scientific Process, helping you to track your progress and continuously refine your technique.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we come to the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of your dedicated practice, where your natural, athletic mesomorph build and balanced extension converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position with confidence—in your modified plank, with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface, your core fully engaged, and your mind entirely focused on precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extension consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with roughly 80% of your force directed to the shallow, sensitive vaginal zone, while the rest of your force is carefully balanced to engage the mid‑depth and deep areas.
Immediately, transition into the lateral phase on one side by performing the tap keystroke with your right (or left) hip. Drop your hip in a small, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps, making sure that the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening and that your penis rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. If any lateral tap seems off—due to uneven pressure or a slight misalignment—pause, isolate that movement, and drill it repeatedly until your internal feedback and her subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you perform the pushout, focus on contracting your core and engaging your pelvic floor, while listening carefully for any subtle indicators from your partner, such as her steady, deep breathing or soft verbal cues. This troubleshooting phase is critical; if you determine that the cumulative stimulation isn’t quite hitting the mark, make slight adjustments—perhaps a minor tweak in your lateral angle or a subtle alteration in the pace of your forward push—and meticulously track the outcomes using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with these refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly in one unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the entire cycle on the opposite side, ensuring balanced stimulation throughout the vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you reach this state, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will be a seamless, continuous expression of your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate finesse—a performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated training into a true art form—a performance where every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your natural mesomorph strength and balanced extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure with every movement. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and elevate your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke bring you ever closer to ultimate intimate mastery
