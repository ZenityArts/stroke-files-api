Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and it’s my honor to work with you—a strong, full‑figured endomorph with a penis below 5 inches. Your body is built for endurance and raw power, with a solid, stable frame that provides you with a formidable base for every movement. Even though your extension is compact, every inch is packed with sensitivity, and when you learn to harness that power with precision, you can deliver intensely focused, cumulative stimulation that really moves the needle in the bedroom.
Imagine stepping into your training space—your personal sanctuary—a quiet, comfortable area where all distractions are left at the door. As you settle in, take a few deep, slow breaths, relax your broad, solid shoulders, and let your mind clear so that you can focus entirely on this session. Today, we’re going to modify the classic missionary position to perfectly suit your endomorphic build. You begin by adopting a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. This position is critical, brother, because it anchors your heavy‑set frame, ensuring that every micro‑movement you perform is executed with deliberate control and precision.
Once you are fully planted, you insert your penis at a precisely controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This is not a random placement—it’s a carefully considered blueprint that will define every movement that follows. Your stroke then begins with a slow, smooth forward push. As you gradually move your entire body forward toward your partner’s head, the top shelf of your compact extension glides gently over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because you have a compact extension, our objective is to concentrate the majority of your stimulation on that shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone (roughly the first 1 to 3 inches) where sensitivity is at its peak. We achieve this using what we call the 80‑10‑10 principle—approximately 80% of your force is dedicated to the shallow area, while the remaining 20% is split evenly between the mid‑depth and the deep zones.
After the forward push, the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke moves into its signature full‑body phase. This stroke is defined by a series of carefully choreographed movements: first, you execute two slow stir movements to one side; then you perform two slow hip rotations; finally, you add a leg raise as you shuttle your body forward. Because you are an endomorph, your stable, robust frame allows you to generate powerful, controlled movements—but it also means you must be mindful of the overall pressure and ensure that your heavier build doesn’t overwhelm the delicate sensations of her shallow zone. The “douplo” aspect comes into play because after you complete the entire sequence on one side, you immediately mirror that exact sequence on the other side. This dual‑phase structure ensures that both sides of her vaginal canal receive balanced, cumulative stimulation.
Throughout this introduction, remember that every movement is measured and deliberate. The forward push sets the stage by establishing a steady base of stimulation focused on that sensitive shallow area, while the subsequent stirs, hip rotations, and leg raises add layers of cumulative pressure. As we go through the modules, you’ll learn to refine each movement, ensuring that your raw, endomorphic power is channeled into a performance that is as scientifically precise as it is intimately satisfying. Welcome, brother—let’s begin turning your raw potential into an artful, masterful expression of intimate control with the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Alright, brother, now that you’re set up and ready to train, let’s dig into the core elements that make your stroke not just effective but extraordinary. The first pillar of your technique is the 80‑10‑10 principle. This principle is all about how you distribute your applied force throughout your stroke. Specifically, it tells you that approximately 80% of your stimulation should be focused on the shallow vaginal zone—the first one to three inches from the entrance, where nerve endings are most densely packed and sensitivity is at its peak. The remaining 20% of your force is split evenly so that 10% reaches the mid‑depth zone (roughly three to five inches) and 10% goes to the deep zone (beyond five inches). For you, as an endomorph with a compact extension, this precise distribution is critical because it ensures that your powerful, robust body delivers concentrated pleasure where it matters most, without overwhelming the more delicate deeper areas.
Next, we have the Sexual Scientific Process. This is our systematic method to consistently refine your stroke and turn practice into progressive mastery. It all starts with defining your goal. That means you need to be crystal clear about what you want to achieve with each stroke—for instance, you might decide that you want to maximize friction along a particular part of her vaginal wall during your stir movements. After setting your goal, you form a hypothesis. Based on your early repetitions, you might hypothesize that a slightly slower pace during the stirs or a softer hip rotation could result in a more pleasurable experience. Then comes tracking—this is the most critical phase in that process. When you perform your stroke, you’re not only paying attention to your own internal cues—like how solid your core feels or how effectively your pelvic floor is engaged—but you’re also observing her responses. Tracking, brother, is primarily about finding out exactly which areas of her vaginal canal she finds most pleasurable at that specific moment. You might aim to perform around 30 repetitions on each wall and then analyze her breathing patterns, subtle shifts in posture, and even her quiet verbal affirmations. With that information in hand, you then move into the state of flow, where every movement becomes so natural and automatic that your stroke occurs with perfect, rhythmic consistency, always delivering the precise pressure and pace she loves.
Tracking and flow are closely linked. While tracking lets you fine‑tune your technique by identifying her sweet spots, flow is the state where, once you’ve determined what works best, you consistently deliver that movement without conscious thought. In flow, every forward push, stir, hip rotation, and leg raise seamlessly transitions into the next, ensuring that the 80‑10‑10 principle is always upheld, and that cumulative stimulation builds steadily and effectively.
Now, let’s talk about the tap keystroke—this drill is essential for mastering lateral movements. Picture yourself in a stable forearm plank position; then, shift laterally until your hip gently taps the surface before returning smoothly to center. Although it’s a small movement, it’s absolutely critical for building the muscle memory and pelvic strength needed to execute your lateral shifts with precision. When you combine this drill with synchronized deep breathing (stroke breathing) and kegeling, you ensure that every lateral movement in your stroke is exactly on target. Mastery of the tap keystroke means that every lateral drop is controlled, every tap is deliberate, and every movement contributes effectively to cumulative, focused stimulation.
Together, these principles provide you with a comprehensive framework: the 80‑10‑10 principle tells you where to focus your force, the Sexual Scientific Process (through tracking and flow) ensures that you fine-tune your stroke based on her real-time feedback, and the tap keystroke drill gives you the precise lateral control you need to hit all the right spots. With these core concepts embedded in your training, you’re now ready to deconstruct the Cacao Stroke into its fundamental components.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Cacao Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Cacao Stroke into every single movement, so you have a clear roadmap of what needs to be done. This stroke is designed specifically for ectomorphs like you with a moderate extension between 5 and 7 inches, combining full‑body dynamics with targeted, cumulative stimulation. The Cacao Stroke unfolds in two distinct phases—first on the right side and then mirrored on the left—to ensure that both halves of the vaginal canal are stimulated equally.
You begin in the classic missionary position, with your knees firmly planted on the canvas and your penis inserted at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle. This initial setup is your blueprint, establishing the correct alignment and setting the stage for every subsequent movement that will focus on delivering cumulative stimulation in line with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
The first phase starts with a smooth, deliberate forward push. Slowly, you push your entire body forward in a northward motion toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, feel the top shelf of your extension glide gently over her clitoral region, while the head of your penis maintains continuous, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” In this phase, about 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, sensitive area, ensuring maximum stimulation where it matters most, while the rest of your force is carefully split between the mid‑depth and deep regions.
Immediately following the forward push, you move into the lateral phase on the right side. Begin by performing two slow, controlled stirs to the right. Visualize your body drawing a perfect circle on the z‑axis from your belly button—as if a pencil were sticking out and tracing a circular pattern on the ground. During these stirs, the hilt of your penis canvases the entire circumference of her vaginal opening, applying gentle, continuous pressure to each segment it touches. This full‑body movement ensures that the force is distributed evenly, yet always focused primarily on the shallow zone.
After the stirs, you proceed with two slow, deliberate hip rotations to the right. As your hips rotate in a controlled arc, the hilt moves steadily along the vaginal opening—from the northwestern segment toward the southwestern segment—while your penis reorients so that its head points toward the southeastern wall and then gradually moves upward to massage the northeastern wall. This rotation is critical for modulating the cumulative pressure and ensuring that every element of your force distribution is finely tuned to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Next, you incorporate a right leg raise as you shuttle your body forward toward your partner’s head. As your right leg lifts, your body continues moving north in a controlled shuttle, and the hilt applies additional targeted pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening. Your penis reorients in such a way that it creates a focused friction on her northwestern wall as you advance. This leg raise adds a dynamic component to the stroke, ensuring that the stimulation builds cumulatively throughout the forward movement.
Once the right‑side sequence is complete, you then mirror the entire process on the left side. Repeat the forward push exactly as before, ensuring that the same 80‑10‑10 principle is applied. Then, perform two slow stirs to the left—imagining, once again, that your body is drawing a circle from your belly button, with the hilt canvassing the vaginal opening to build a gentle, cumulative massage. Follow that with two slow hip rotations to the left, where the hilt shifts its pressure from the northeastern segment to the southeastern segment, and your penis adjusts its orientation to create a gentle, upward massage on the opposite wall. Finally, raise your left leg as you shuttle forward, ensuring the targeted pressure on the left side is delivered with precision.
By deconstructing the Cacao Stroke into these detailed segments—forward push, stirs, hip rotations, and leg raises—you get a clear, step‑by‑step blueprint that adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Each individual movement is meticulously designed to build cumulative stimulation in that highly sensitive shallow zone, while still engaging the deeper areas in a balanced manner. This comprehensive breakdown provides you with all the specifics you need to execute every movement with technical precision and fluidity.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each component of the Cacao Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as your own breath. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension between 5 and 7 inches, precision and consistency are key. In this module, we’ll practice each element individually and then in combination, repeating each drill until you achieve flawless muscle memory while strictly adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Start with the forward push drill. Get into your modified plank position, with your knees firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface, anchoring your long, lean frame. Insert your penis at the precisely calculated downward diagonal angle, then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus deeply on the sensation—the top shelf of your extension should glide smoothly over her clitoral area while the head maintains continuous, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because you have a compact extension, roughly 80% of your force must be directed to the shallow, sensitive vaginal zone. Drill this forward push slowly and deliberately until you can achieve a smooth, consistent motion every time.
Next, work on the right‑side stir drill. From your forward push position, perform two slow, deliberate stirs to the right. Visualize your body as if you’re drawing a perfect circle with a pencil from your belly button on the ground. As you complete each stir, focus on how the hilt of your penis canvases the circumference of her vaginal opening, applying gentle, cumulative pressure along every segment. Maintain a smooth, controlled motion throughout and practice with deep, steady breathing until the movement feels completely ingrained.
Then, transition to the hip rotation drill on the right side. Execute two slow, controlled hip rotations—letting the hilt shift its applied pressure gradually from the northwestern segment to the southwestern segment of her vaginal opening. As you rotate, adjust your penis so that the head points toward the southeastern wall and then moves upward to massage the northeastern wall. Focus on keeping the movement rhythmic and steady, making sure that your force distribution remains in line with the 80‑10‑10 principle. Repeat these rotations until the motion is smooth and precise.
Next, practice the right leg raise and forward shuttle drill. As you continue moving forward, slowly lift your right leg until your knee rises, then continue shuttling your body north toward your partner’s head. During this movement, pay close attention to how the hilt applies additional targeted pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your penis reorients to maintain friction along the northwestern wall. Drill this combination repeatedly until the coordination between the leg raise and the forward shuttle becomes seamless and deliberate.
Once you’ve mastered the right‑side drills, mirror the exact same drills on the left side. Practice two slow stirs to the left, followed by two controlled hip rotations to the left, and then execute a left leg raise combined with the forward shuttle. Aim for at least 30 repetitions for each drill so that every movement becomes automatic and ingrained. Always maintain deep, deliberate breathing throughout—each deep inhale primes you for the next precise movement, and every controlled exhale ensures a smooth transition.
With disciplined, consistent practice of each individual component, your lean ectomorphic agility and compact extension will become fully integrated into your stroke, allowing you to execute every micro‑movement with flawless precision and cumulative intensity.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to bring everything together and create a continuous, seamless performance—the full Cacao Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance, with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your focus solely on fluid integration. In this module, you’ll merge all the drilled components into one rhythmic sequence that ensures every movement contributes to cumulative, balanced stimulation.
Start with the forward push—insert your penis at that ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you advance, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides gently over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant contact with her “south wall.” This forward push is the foundation of your performance and must be executed in strict accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle, delivering about 80% of your force to the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the right‑side sequence. Execute two slow, deliberate stirs to the right—imagine your body drawing a perfect circle from your belly button, with the hilt canvassing the vaginal opening gently. Then, perform two controlled hip rotations to the right, ensuring the hilt gradually shifts its pressure from the northwestern to the southwestern segment while your penis reorients to produce a consistent upward massage along her walls. Follow these movements with a right leg raise as you shuttle forward, directing targeted pressure along the right side as your penis continues to provide consistent friction against her northwestern wall.
Once the right‑side sequence is complete, seamlessly reset and mirror the same process on the left side. Again, begin with a smooth forward push (strictly adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle), then perform two slow stirs to the left, two controlled hip rotations to the left, and finally a left leg raise as you shuttle forward. This alternating “walking” motion—first right, then left—creates a rhythmic “W” pattern that ensures both sides of the vaginal canal receive balanced, cumulative stimulation.
As you integrate these movements, let your deep, rhythmic breathing serve as your internal metronome. Each deep inhale prepares your body for the next micro‑movement, and each slow, controlled exhale ensures seamless transitions from one component to the next. With every complete cycle, your entire Cacao Stroke becomes a fluid, continuous, and harmonious performance that delivers optimal, scientifically guided stimulation exactly where it’s needed.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where we focus on fine‑tuning every micro‑adjustment to ensure your Cacao Stroke consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your lean ectomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every movement must be executed with precise control to adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that roughly 80% of your force always targets the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep areas.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, pay close attention to the sensations throughout. During the forward push, observe that the top shelf of your extension glides flawlessly over her clitoral region and that the head maintains steady, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you perform your stirs, hip rotations, and leg raises, take note of the gentle rocking motions produced by your lateral shifts. Here’s where tracking comes into play: with each repetition, observe not only how your body feels—pay attention to your core engagement and the strength of your pelvic floor—but also listen carefully for your partner’s cues. Tracking is about identifying which specific movements produce the most pleasurable response at that particular time. Maybe you notice that a slightly slower stir or a minor adjustment in the hip rotation angle elicits a noticeable response from her. This feedback is vital, because it tells you precisely where she wants to be stimulated and how. Once you’ve tracked her responses over, say, 30 or more repetitions per “wall,” you reach a state of flow—a state where your movements become automatic, rhythmic, and perfectly attuned to her feedback.
Flow is the point at which all your refined adjustments come together and every forward push, stir, hip rotation, and leg raise occurs seamlessly without conscious thought. In this state, you are massaging her exactly in the way she finds most pleasurable, with the precise pressure and pace that leads her steadily toward climax. Throughout this phase, your deep, rhythmic breathing is key—it synchronizes your body and allows you to move from one micro‑movement to the next effortlessly.
The tap keystroke drill remains a constant foundation in your training. By practicing that controlled lateral shift—from a stable forearm plank, moving laterally until your hip gently taps the surface before returning to center—you build the muscle memory and pelvic strength needed for every lateral movement in your stroke. This drill ensures that every lateral drop and subsequent reset is executed with pinpoint accuracy, maintaining the integrity of the 80‑10‑10 distribution while consistently targeting her sensitive areas.
Every time you practice, remember that the Sexual Scientific Process is your roadmap. You define your goals, form hypotheses, track the feedback, and enter flow—refining your technique until every repetition is perfectly calibrated. In this advanced phase, every tiny adjustment matters, and by continuously refining your technique, you’ll reach a level where your Cacao Stroke becomes an effortless, rhythmic display of cumulative stimulation. That is what ultimately brings her to climax—when she can concentrate solely on the sensation because every move is executed with natural, automatic precision.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a disciplined training regimen designed to reinforce every element of the Cacao Stroke while also strengthening your core and overall stability. This is especially important for you as an ectomorph with a moderate extension between 5 and 7 inches. Your naturally lean, agile body is your strength, and with focused training, you’ll translate that raw athletic power into a repeatable, cumulative performance that consistently delivers pleasure.
Start by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are minimal and you can concentrate solely on your practice. Every training session begins with a thorough warm‑up designed specifically for your ectomorphic build. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back—these are the support structures that keep your lean limbs stable and allow you to perform precise movements. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, unlocking the potential in every muscle, and setting a clear, positive intention for the session as you take several deep, focused breaths.
Next, move into specialized drills. Begin with the tap keystroke drill. Get into your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted, then practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your extension between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral move must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Focus on gently shifting your body laterally until your hip lightly taps the supporting surface, then return smoothly to center. Synchronize these taps with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale deeply before each shift and exhale slowly as you complete it. Integrate kegeling exercises with each repetition to strengthen your pelvic floor and further hone your control. Aim for at least 30 precise repetitions on each side until the movement becomes ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve mastered the lateral taps, integrate them with vertical movements. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and finishing with a smooth, deliberate backward shuttle. Ensure that every part of this integrated sequence adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle—concentrating about 80% of your force on the shallow zone. Drill this complete sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition is fluid and the stroke feels natural. To further enhance your stability and precision, supplement your drills with targeted core-strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills. A strong core is essential; it supports every movement and ensures the accuracy and consistency of your stroke. Finally, maintain a detailed training journal where you document every session—record the number of repetitions, note any adjustments you experiment with, and capture your partner’s feedback. This journal forms a critical part of the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to monitor progress, fine-tune your technique continuously, and ultimately reach mastery.
Your personalized practice routine is the backbone of your technique, brother. Through disciplined, consistent training, you’ll convert your natural mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a flawless performance—a stroke that is fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying for both you and your partner.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—a stage devoted to merging every drilled component of the Cacao Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any minor imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of all your diligent practice, where your lean, agile ectomorphic frame and your moderate extension come together as a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core strongly engaged, and your mind fully tuned into precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides effortlessly over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must adhere rigorously to the 80‑10‑10 principle—concentrating about 80% of your force on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone, while the remaining force is carefully balanced to engage the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately after the forward push, transition into the lateral phase on one side by executing the tap keystroke with your chosen hip. Drop your hip in a small, deliberate lateral movement until it gently taps the supporting surface, then return smoothly to center. Focus intently as the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface produces a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. If you find any lateral tap to be inconsistent—perhaps the pressure isn’t even or the angle seems slightly off—pause, isolate that movement, and drill it repeatedly until both your own internal feedback and her subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced and aligned with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal cues. As you perform the pushout, focus on contracting your core and engaging your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for subtle indicators from your partner—her deep, steady breathing and any soft verbal feedback will tell you if you’re on target. If you notice that the cumulative stimulation isn’t quite where it needs to be, make slight, mindful adjustments—perhaps modifying your lateral angle by a degree or two, or fine-tuning the pace of your forward push—and meticulously track the outcomes using your Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one rhythmic, unified performance. Then, mirror the entire cycle on the opposite side, ensuring balanced, cumulative stimulation across her entire vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal of this training. When you reach this state, your Cacao Stroke will become a continuous, fluid masterpiece that not only adheres perfectly to the 80‑10‑10 principle but also delivers the exact, focused stimulation that brings her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your dedicated training into a true work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every stir, every hip rotation, and every leg raise is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your naturally lean, agile ectomorphic frame and moderate extension will have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic Cacao Stroke that delivers optimal, scientifically refined pleasure with every move. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Cacao Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
