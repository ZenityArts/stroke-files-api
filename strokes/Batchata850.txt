Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformative journey with the Batchata Stroke—a full‑body, rocking technique designed specifically for endomorphs with an extension above 7 inches. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to guide you as you learn to channel your immense, rock‑solid power into a meticulously controlled, cumulative performance. Your robust, full‑figured build gives you a rock‑steady, enduring base that supports every deliberate movement you make. With your extended asset, you have an impressive reach that, when properly harnessed, can deliver expansive, deep stimulation. Today, we’re going to convert that raw, substantial power into a precisely choreographed Batchata Stroke that brings balanced, focused cumulative pleasure to your partner.
Imagine stepping into your personal training sanctuary—a quiet, dedicated space free from distractions, where your mind and body are wholly present. Feel the firm support of the floor beneath you, as unwavering as the foundation of your robust frame. Take several deep, slow breaths; with each inhale, draw in focused energy, and with every exhale, release all tension. This is your arena, brother—a space where your natural power and endurance are refined into a masterful stroke that exerts purposeful, cumulative stimulation.
We begin by modifying the classic missionary position to suit your endomorphic structure. Start in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface engineered to bear your substantial weight. This foundational posture anchors your whole body so that every micro‑movement—from the subtle sway of your hips to the broad, controlled lateral shifts—is executed with deliberate precision. Your solid build demands that every shift of your body be measured and controlled so that your tremendous force is exactly focused where it counts, without overwhelming her delicate, nerve‑rich areas.
Once you’re securely set, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This deliberate insertion is your blueprint; it establishes the precise angles and pressure points that will govern every subsequent movement. Your journey begins with a smooth, deliberate forward push. As you gradually drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head, feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, intentional contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, you have the capacity to reach deep; however, it’s essential that you focus roughly 80% of your applied force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone (the first 1–3 inches), with the remaining 20% evenly distributed between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This force allocation—the 80‑10‑10 principle—is the cornerstone of cumulative, balanced stimulation.
Once the forward push is established, the Batchata Stroke unfolds into its signature full‑body rocking phase. This phase harnesses the natural sway of your hips to produce cumulative stimulation. You will execute a series of deliberate lateral shifts following a rhythmic “W” pattern. For example, you might begin by shifting fully to the left, then switching to the right, followed by another left shift, and finally executing a “double down” on the left to further intensify the pressure. After this left-side sequence, you mirror the process on the right—shifting right, then left, then right again, culminating with a right double down. When shifting left, your entire body moves laterally in a controlled manner; the hilt applies a steady pressure against the left segment of her vaginal opening, while your shaft rotates so it points to her right wall, delivering a broad, massaging touch. Conversely, when shifting right, the forces reverse. The “double down” is a controlled additional lowering of your body on that side to further intensify the stimulation. This rhythmic, alternating sequence transforms your raw, substantial force into a carefully choreographed, cumulative Batchata Stroke.
This introduction sets the stage, brother. It teaches you how to prepare your environment, adopt your ideal posture, and channel your robust endomorphic power with your extended asset into a stroke that delivers precise, cumulative stimulation. Welcome, brother—today, we begin turning your inherent strength into a masterful Batchata Stroke that brings deep, balanced pleasure every time.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Alright, brother, let’s break down the technical framework behind your Batchata Stroke. This is where the science behind your intimate art is laid bare, ensuring every movement is both precise and cumulative. I’m going to explain the 80‑10‑10 principle, the Sexual Scientific Process (including tracking and flow), and the tap keystroke drill—each element crucial for your technique.
First up is the 80‑10‑10 principle. Picture this principle as your force-distribution blueprint. Roughly 80% of the force you apply during your stroke should hit the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because that’s where most of the nerve endings lie and where the sensitivity is highest. The remaining 20% is split evenly: 10% goes to the mid‑depth area (approximately 3 to 5 inches) and 10% is dedicated to the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an endomorph with an extended asset above 7 inches, this principle is critical. Even though your reach allows you to stimulate deeper areas, the bulk of your force must consistently be focused on the sensitive shallow zone while still offering a balanced, cumulative touch deeper inside. This even distribution prevents any area from being overloaded while maximizing cumulative stimulation.
Next, the Sexual Scientific Process is our structured method for continuously refining your technique. It begins with setting a clear goal—perhaps maximizing the rocking friction during your lateral shifts or fine‑tuning the pressure during your double downs. Once your goal is defined, you form a hypothesis—maybe you suspect that a slightly slower lateral shift will yield a more cumulative effect. Then comes tracking, which is your real‑time feedback loop. As you perform your stroke, aim for about 30 repetitions on each “wall” of her vaginal canal while paying close attention to your internal cues (ensuring your core is engaged, your pelvic floor is activated) and, most importantly, her responses. Listen to her deep, rhythmic breathing, watch for subtle body movements, and note any soft verbal cues; tracking tells you exactly which movements hit her sweet spots and where adjustments are needed.
Once you have sufficient feedback through tracking, you enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical state where every micro‑movement—from your forward push to every lateral shift and double down—occurs seamlessly and automatically in rhythm. In flow, your stroke becomes an unbroken series of perfect, cumulative movements, delivering the precise pressure and pace identified by your tracking. It’s the point where your technique becomes second nature.
Finally, let’s discuss the tap keystroke drill, a fundamental exercise for fine‑tuning lateral precision. Picture yourself in a stable forearm plank; then, slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, and then return smoothly to center. Although it may seem like a simple move, this drill builds the muscle memory and strengthens your pelvic floor, ensuring that each lateral movement in your stroke is executed with impeccable precision. When practiced with deep, controlled “stroke breathing” and integrated with kegeling exercises, the tap keystroke drill ensures every lateral shift adheres perfectly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
So, brother, in summary: the 80‑10‑10 principle ensures you concentrate 80% of your force on the shallow zone and split the remaining 20% evenly between the mid‑depth and deep layers; the Sexual Scientific Process enables you to set clear goals, form hypotheses, track her feedback, and ultimately enter a seamless state of flow; and the tap keystroke drill builds the precise lateral control needed for every movement. With these foundational elements in place, you’re primed to deconstruct and master the Batchata Stroke with scientific precision and cumulative intensity.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Batchata Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Batchata Stroke into every deliberate, micro-controlled movement so that you have a complete, step-by-step blueprint for your performance. The Batchata is a full‑body, rocking stroke that harnesses deliberate lateral shifts to massage the vaginal canal with cumulative, balanced pressure. As an endomorph with an extended asset above 7 inches, your challenge is to convert your inherent robust power and sturdy base into deliberate, controlled movements that deliver intense cumulative stimulation without overwhelming her sensitive areas.
You begin in the modified missionary position with your knees firmly planted on the canvas and your penis inserted at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle. This starting setup is your blueprint—it establishes the exact angles and pressure points that guide every subsequent movement, ensuring strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
The stroke starts with a smooth, deliberate forward push. As you drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head, feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, you have a broad reach; however, you must ensure that approximately 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone (the first 1 to 3 inches) while the remaining 20% is evenly distributed to the mid‑depth and deep layers. This focus is the foundation of cumulative stimulation.
Immediately after the forward push, you transition into the lateral phase—the heart of the Batchata Stroke. Begin with a full‑body lateral shift to the left. As you lean to the left, your entire body moves in a controlled, deliberate manner. The hilt of your penis applies steady pressure on the left segment of her vaginal opening, while your shaft rotates so that it points toward her right wall, delivering broad, massaging pressure. Here’s where the correct hip rotation details come into play: when shifting left, if you include hip rotations, perform 2 slow hip rotations in which the hilt canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment of her vaginal opening; during this movement, the head of your penis first points toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall. This precise rotation ensures that stimulation is directed exactly where it’s needed.
After completing the left shift (with its integrated hip rotations), you immediately transition to a right lateral shift. As you shift right, your body moves in the opposite direction—the hilt now applies steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your shaft rotates to deliver broad, rhythmic pressure toward her left wall. For the right shift with hip rotations, perform 2 slow rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment, and the head first points toward the southwestern wall then shifts to the north‑western wall. This alternating left-right pattern forms the rhythmic “W” pattern that is the signature of the Batchata Stroke, ensuring balanced, cumulative stimulation across her entire vaginal canal.
To intensify the massage, you integrate a “double down.” After a standard lateral shift (say, to the left), you lower your body further in a controlled, deliberate manner to execute a left double down. This extra lowering means the hilt applies additional, intensified pressure on the left side of her vaginal opening, while your shaft continues its broad, cumulative motion toward her right wall—amplifying the overall stimulation. Once the left sequence is complete, mirror the process on the right side by performing a right shift followed by a right double down, so that both sides receive balanced, heightened stimulation.
Every movement—the forward push, each lateral shift with integrated hip rotations, and every controlled double down—is a keystroke in the Batchata Stroke. Your ability to execute these moves with deliberation and precision, in accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensures that cumulative stimulation is delivered exactly where it’s needed. This detailed deconstruction gives you a complete, step-by-step roadmap for transforming your robust power and extended reach into a finely tuned, cumulative performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill every individual component of your Batchata Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as breathing. With your lean, long‑limbed ectomorphic build and an extension above 7 inches, precision and control are paramount. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and drill it repeatedly so that every movement is engraved in your muscle memory—all while rigorously following the 80‑10‑10 principle and incorporating the corrected hip rotation details.
Start with the forward push drill. Get into your modified missionary position with your knees firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface that can handle your lean build. Carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle, then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation: feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide smoothly over her clitoral region while ensuring that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, dedicate approximately 80% of your applied force to the shallow, nerve‑rich area. Perform this forward push slowly and deliberately until each repetition is smooth, controlled, and consistent.
Next, move into your lateral shift drills. Begin with a left lateral shift. From your forward push position, slowly shift your entire body to the left in a controlled manner. Concentrate on moving your weight smoothly; feel your hilt press steadily against the left portion of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates to deliver broad, rhythmic pressure toward her right wall. Incorporate the correct hip rotations: as you shift left, execute 2 slow hip rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, with the head first pointing toward the southeastern wall and then moving to the north‑eastern wall. Drill this movement repeatedly until it becomes second nature.
Then, practice the right lateral shift in a similar fashion. Slowly shift your body to the right, ensuring your hilt applies consistent pressure on the right side of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates so it points toward her left wall, delivering broad, balanced pressure. Integrate 2 slow hip rotations for the right shift, where the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, with the head initially directed toward the southwestern wall and then to the north‑western wall. Alternate these lateral shifts until you can transition seamlessly between left and right, always maintaining the 80‑10‑10 force distribution.
Now, add the “double down” element. On the left side, after a standard left shift, lower your body further in a controlled, deliberate manner to perform a left double down. Focus on intensifying the pressure so that the hilt delivers additional, focused force to the left portion of her vaginal opening, while your shaft continues its broad, cumulative pressure toward her right wall—amplifying the overall stimulation. Drill this movement slowly until every lowering is controlled and precise. Then mirror the process on the right side—execute a right shift, then lower your body further to perform a right double down, intensifying the pressure on that side. Repeat each drill at least 30 times per side until every micro‑movement is completely ingrained in your muscle memory.
Throughout all these drills, maintain deep, controlled breathing. Each deep inhale fills you with focus, and each deliberate exhale guides you smoothly from one movement to the next. Additionally, incorporate the tap keystroke drill into your practice routine: assume a stable forearm plank, then slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the surface, and return to center. This drill is essential for refining your lateral precision and ensuring each movement consistently adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to synthesize all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Batchata Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance, with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your focus solely on linking every movement into one uninterrupted rhythmic cycle. In this integrated sequence, you’ll combine your forward push with your lateral shifts, corrected hip rotations, and double downs into the signature “W” pattern that delivers balanced cumulative stimulation throughout her entire vaginal canal.
Begin with a deliberate forward push. Insert your penis at the precisely controlled downward diagonal angle, and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide seamlessly over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push lays the foundation, strictly following the 80‑10‑10 principle so that about 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, highly sensitive zone, with the remaining force evenly distributed to the mid‑depth and deep areas.
Immediately after the forward push, transition into your left-side sequence. Execute a full‑body lateral shift to the left—feel your body move in a smooth, controlled motion as the hilt applies consistent pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening, while your shaft rotates to provide broad, rhythmic pressure toward her right wall. Integrate your two slow hip rotations during the left shift: let the hilt canvas from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, with the head moving from the southeastern to the north‑eastern wall. Then, perform a left double down by lowering your body further in a controlled manner to intensify the stimulation. Once the left sequence is completed, quickly reset and shift your body to the right. As you lean to the right, the hilt applies steady pressure to the right side of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates so that broad pressure is delivered toward her left wall. Follow this with a right double down—lower your body further to amplify the stimulation on that side. Alternating these movements—left shift with double down, then right shift with double down—creates the rhythmic “W” pattern that ensures balanced cumulative stimulation across her entire vaginal canal.
Throughout the integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome. With every deep inhale, you prepare for the next precise movement, and every controlled exhale helps you transition seamlessly between components. With each complete cycle, your Batchata Stroke evolves into a continuous, fluid performance that strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle, delivering precisely targeted cumulative stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where every micro‑movement of your Batchata Stroke is honed until your performance becomes a perfectly tuned masterpiece of cumulative stimulation. With your naturally lean, long‑limbed ectomorphic build and extended asset above 7 inches, every detail matters. The 80‑10‑10 principle continues to be your guiding star: approximately 80% of your force must be concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep regions.
As you execute your integrated sequence, pay close attention to the quality and consistency of every movement. During your forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your extended asset glides smoothly over her clitoral region, and that your head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” As you perform your lateral shifts and double downs—with the corrected hip rotation details—observe how the hilt and shaft distribute pressure evenly along her vaginal walls. This is where tracking is crucial: every repetition provides you with real-time feedback. Listen closely to her deep, rhythmic breathing; note any subtle changes in her posture; and be acutely receptive to any soft verbal cues that signal which movements yield the most cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your immediate feedback loop, enabling you to fine-tune your technique on the fly.
Once you gather sufficient data—aim for around 30 repetitions per wall—you’ll naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that magical condition where every micro‑movement—from your forward push to each lateral shift and double down—occurs seamlessly, automatically, and in perfect rhythm. In flow, you consistently deliver the precise pressure and timing that your tracking has identified as ideal, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with each cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is essential throughout this process; every deep inhale equips you for the next movement, and every measured exhale smooths the transitions between components. If any lateral movement seems off—if the pressure is unbalanced or the angle isn’t precisely calibrated—pause, track the feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until everything aligns perfectly with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to create your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training program designed to reinforce every element of your Batchata Stroke while building core strength and overall stability essential for your robust endomorphic build with an extension in the 5‑7‑inch range. Your natural power, endurance, and stability are your greatest assets, and this routine will help you convert raw, potent energy into a flawless, repeatable performance that consistently delivers cumulative, precisely targeted stimulation.
Begin by establishing your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are kept to a minimum and your focus is entirely on mastering your technique. Every training session should start with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your endomorphic structure. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back—the muscle groups that form the foundation of your stability and control. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the rigorous drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a determined, positive tone for the session.
Next, move on to specialized drills starting with the tap keystroke drill. Assume your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface capable of supporting your full‑figured build, and practice small, controlled lateral taps—shift your body slowly until your hip gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Since your extension is in the moderate 5‑7‑inch range, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Synchronize each shift with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale deeply before each move and exhale slowly as you return. Integrate kegeling exercises with every repetition to further strengthen your pelvic floor and enhance your precision. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke is fully ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve mastered the tap keystroke, integrate it with your forward push and lateral shifts. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral shifts and a smooth, deliberate backward shuttle. Throughout this integrated sequence, ensure every movement adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with approximately 80% of your force directed toward the shallow, sensitive vaginal zone. Drill this complete sequence repeatedly on both sides until each transition is seamless and the entire stroke becomes second nature. To further increase your stability and fine‑tune your control, supplement your routine with targeted core-strengthening exercises—like planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills—because your core is the anchor that ensures every move is executed with maximum precision. Finally, maintain a detailed training journal where you record every session, document the number of repetitions, note any adjustments you make, and capture her feedback. This journal is a vital tool within the Sexual Scientific Process, helping you continuously track progress and refine your technique until it reaches perfection.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—the culmination of your dedicated practice, where every drilled component of your Batchata Stroke merges into one seamless, continuous performance. In this final module, your robust endomorphic build with an extension between 5 and 7 inches comes together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of intimate mastery that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified plank—with your knees firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface, your core engaged, and your mind tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, feel the top shelf of your moderate extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously follow the 80‑10‑10 principle—about 80% of your force must be concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone while the remaining force is meticulously balanced to stimulate the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase on one side by executing the tap keystroke with your chosen hip. Slowly lower your hip in a measured, deliberate lateral shift until it gently taps the supporting surface, then return smoothly to center. Focus intently on the sensation—observe how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening, and note how your shaft rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. Incorporate the correct hip rotation details into your lateral movement: if shifting to the right, perform 2 slow hip rotations in which the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment with the head moving from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall; if shifting to the left, execute 2 slow hip rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment while the head shifts from the southeastern to the north‑eastern wall. If any lateral movement feels slightly off—if the pressure isn’t perfectly balanced or the angle requires adjustment—pause, isolate that movement, and drill it until both your internal cues and her subtle feedback confirm perfect alignment with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position and allows you to gather precise internal feedback. As you push upward, contract your core and engage your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for her responses. Her deep, steady breathing and any soft verbal cues will tell you if your movement is exactly on target. Should you sense that cumulative stimulation isn’t at its optimum, make small, mindful adjustments—perhaps tweaking your lateral angle by a degree or altering the pace of your forward push—and meticulously track these changes using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps with perfect hip rotations, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one rhythmic, unified performance. Then, mirror the complete cycle on the opposite side, ensuring balanced, cumulative stimulation is delivered throughout her entire vaginal canal. Your ultimate goal is to achieve a state of natural flow—a condition where every movement occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you reach that state, your Batchata Stroke becomes a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers the precise, focused stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every lateral shift, every double down, and every microscopic adjustment is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your robust endomorphic build and extension between 5 and 7 inches will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Batchata Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Batchata Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
