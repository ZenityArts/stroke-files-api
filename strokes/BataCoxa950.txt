Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Bata Coxa Stroke! I’m Coach [Your Name], and it’s my honor to work with you—an athletic mesomorph with an extension above 7 inches. Your body is the epitome of strength, speed, and balance. With well‑developed muscles and a robust, proportionate build, you are naturally agile and capable of executing quick, precise movements. At the same time, your extended asset offers a vast stimulation field—but it also demands extra precision so that the abundant sensitivity of the shallow zone isn’t diluted by excessive deep force.
Before we begin, take a moment to find a quiet, comfortable space that you can call your training sanctuary—a place free from distractions where you can focus completely. Sit or lie down, relax your broad, muscular shoulders, and take several deep, steady breaths so your mind and body are clear and receptive. Today, we’re going to convert your raw mesomorph power and extended reach into a meticulously choreographed sequence of movements that harness scientific precision to deliver cumulative, deeply satisfying stimulation.
We begin by adapting the classic missionary position for your mesomorphic frame. Start by getting into a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. This grounding is essential for your powerful, well‑balanced build—it anchors you firmly, ensuring that every single micro‑movement is executed with the control and precision your physique demands. Once you’re steady, insert your penis at a precisely calculated downward diagonal angle into your partner; this precise angle serves as the blueprint for the remainder of the stroke.
Your first action is a smooth, measured forward push. Slowly move your entire body northward, toward your partner’s head. As you do, the top shelf of your extended penis glides gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Here, it’s crucial that, despite your extra length, you direct the lion’s share of your stimulation to the shallow vaginal zone. We do this by strictly applying the 80‑10‑10 principle, which dictates that approximately 80% of your force is concentrated on the first 1 to 3 inches—the nerve‑rich, most sensitive area—while the remaining 20% is evenly split between the mid‑depth (3–5 inches) and deep zones. This ensures maximum stimulation where it counts most without losing balance.
Following the forward push, the stroke transitions into the lateral phase. Here, your mesomorphic agility and coordinated strength become your greatest asset. You’ll begin a series of controlled lateral movements using your left hip. With your extended asset, each lateral drop requires precise control to ensure that the abundant stimulation is focused primarily on the shallow zone. Drop your left hip slowly toward the surface; as you do, the hilt of your penis applies a steady, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right. This reorientation creates friction and a gentle rocking massage along her right wall. Following the drop, you then raise your left hip back toward the center, reversing the force distribution; the cumulative stimulation shifts as the hilt’s pressure now travels from the western section toward the northern section, while your penis points north, massaging upward from the northern to the eastern wall.
The stroke continues by repeating this drop-and-raise cycle—sometimes at a steady pace, and at other times with a variation in speed (for example, raising your left hip halfway toward center at a faster pace to intensify friction). These variations are designed to dynamically modulate the cumulative stimulation across different sections of her vaginal canal. Finally, you complete the cycle by fully returning your left hip to the center, which resets the pressure profile before starting the sequence over again.
This introduction lays the foundation for converting your raw mesomorph power and above‑7‑inch extension into a precisely executed, cumulative performance. Every forward push, lateral drop-and-raise, and controlled reset is executed with a singular focus: to maximize stimulation where it matters most while maintaining a balanced, scientific approach. Welcome, brother—let’s begin transforming your innate power into a masterful, intimate art form with the Bata Coxa Stroke!
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re going to break down the core principles that form the foundation of our training for the Bata Coxa Stroke. Each of these elements is critical to ensuring that every micro‑movement in your stroke is executed with scientific precision and cumulative effect.
First, the 80‑10‑10 Principle. This principle instructs you to allocate about 80% of your applied force to the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches—which is packed with nerve endings and is the most sensitive area. The remaining 20% of your force should be divided equally, with 10% directed to the mid‑depth (approximately 3–5 inches) and 10% to the deep zones (beyond 5 inches). For a mesomorph with an extended asset, this means that while you have the reach to engage deeper tissues, the majority of the stimulation must remain focused on the shallow zone to maximize pleasure. This precise force distribution is the key to ensuring that your cumulative stimulation is balanced and highly effective.
Next, we have the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic and iterative method for refining your technique. This process involves:
Defining the Goal: Clearly articulate what you want to achieve with your stroke—say, intensifying friction along specific vaginal walls during the lateral movement.
Forming a Hypothesis: Based on your observations and your partner’s feedback, predict what slight modifications (such as changing the pace of your hip drop) might enhance the stimulation.
Tracking: Methodically perform a substantial number of repetitions—ideally, at least 30 strokes on each “wall” of the vaginal canal—while carefully recording both your internal sensations (your core engagement, pelvic floor strength) and your partner’s responses (her breathing, subtle movements, and verbal feedback).
Flow: Once you identify the optimal technique that consistently produces the best results, commit to that rhythmic, automatic sequence. Flow is when your movement becomes seamless and instinctual, ensuring that each action flawlessly conforms to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Tracking is the process of gathering detailed data from each cycle of your stroke. As you perform the move, monitor how your partner responds and also tune in to your internal cues. This careful observation allows you to fine‑tune your technique over time.
Flow is the state where every micro‑movement—from your forward push to your lateral taps and backward shuttle—happens automatically and harmoniously. When you’re in flow, your stroke is perfectly rhythmic, and the 80‑10‑10 distribution is consistently maintained, resulting in cumulative, profound stimulation.
The Tap Keystroke is a foundational drill used to perfect your lateral movements. It involves starting from a stable position—typically a forearm plank—shifting laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, then returning smoothly to center. This precise, minimal movement builds muscle memory and strengthens your pelvic floor, ensuring that every lateral shift in your stroke is executed with pinpoint accuracy. Coordinated breathing and kegeling during this drill further enhance your control, making the tap keystroke essential for achieving the controlled, cumulative effect of the lateral phase.
Together, these principles—balanced force distribution (80‑10‑10), a systematic refinement process (Sexual Scientific Process), thorough tracking, achieving flow, and mastering the tap keystroke—form the scientific underpinning of your training. They guide every aspect of the Bata Coxa Stroke, ensuring that each movement is executed with precision, control, and cumulative impact. With these core concepts clearly understood, you’re ready to move on to deconstructing the stroke into its fundamental components.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Bata Coxa Stroke into its individual components so you can master each element before integrating them into a seamless performance. Picture yourself again in the classic missionary position—on top in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. With your athletic mesomorph build and an extension above 7 inches, every micro‑movement plays a critical role in delivering cumulative, targeted stimulation. We’ll isolate each phase so that you have a clear blueprint to follow.
Forward Movement: The stroke begins when you insert your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. From this starting position, execute a smooth forward push by moving your entire body steadily northward toward your partner’s head. During this forward push, the top shelf of your extended penis glides effortlessly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This movement lays the groundwork for the stroke—ensuring that, in strict accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle, approximately 80% of your applied force is dedicated to the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone (roughly the first 1 to 3 inches). Because your extension is above 7 inches, every inch of forward progress must be controlled to ensure that this sensitive zone receives focused stimulation without overwhelming the deeper tissues.
Lateral Phase (Left Hip Drop): After the forward push, transition into the lateral phase by initiating a controlled lateral shift through a left hip drop. In this movement, you slowly lower your left hip toward the supporting surface. As you do this, the hilt of your penis applies focused, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right. This reorientation generates friction and creates a gentle, upward rocking massage along her right wall—from the eastern wall moving toward the northern wall. This lateral drop is performed using the tap keystroke—each small, deliberate movement must be executed with precision so that the bulk of the stimulation remains in the shallow zone while still contributing to cumulative pressure along the walls.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Reversal): Immediately after the lateral drop, raise your left hip back toward the center. This controlled raise reverses the pressure gradient: now the hilt of your penis applies force from the western section of her vaginal opening toward the northern section, while your penis reorients to point straight north. This produces a gentle upward massage along the northern wall heading toward the eastern wall. This reversal is critical for integrating the stimulation from the lateral phase and maintaining a rhythmic balance, ensuring that the 80‑10‑10 principle is continuously honored.
Cycle Repetition with Variations in Pace: The stroke then continues with repeated cycles of left hip drops and raises. In some cycles, you may choose to raise your left hip only halfway toward the center at a faster pace. This faster half-raise increases friction and slightly alters the pressure pattern, thereby intensifying the cumulative stimulation in a complementary way. Following that, perform another full drop to reapply the targeted force, and finally complete the sequence by fully raising your left hip back to center. These variations create a dynamic “W” pattern—a rhythmic sequence that evolves the stimulation with every cycle while ensuring that the majority of your force is delivered to the shallow, nerve‑rich zone.
By deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into these four distinct phases—forward push, lateral drop via the tap keystroke, controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle (which resets the position)—you gain a clear, methodical blueprint for your training. Each element is executed with unwavering precision so that approximately 80% of your applied force is focused on the shallow, most sensitive region, while the remaining force is carefully distributed to the mid‑depth and deep zones. This detailed breakdown is essential for transforming your natural mesomorph power and extended reach into a refined, cumulative performance that is both scientifically optimized and intimately effective.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each individual component of the Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as your breath. With your athletic mesomorph build and an extension above 7 inches, precision and consistency are paramount. In this module, we’ll focus on repetitive, intensive practice of each segmented movement—starting with the forward push, then isolating the lateral drop (via the tap keystroke), followed by controlled hip lowering, and finally the backward shuttle—so that every repetition is executed perfectly in line with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Forward Movement Drill: Begin by assuming your modified plank position, ensuring your knees are firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface to anchor your athletic frame. Insert your penis at the carefully calculated downward diagonal angle, and then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Concentrate on the sensations: feel the top shelf of your extended penis glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, it is critical that about 80% of your force is devoted to stimulating the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone. Perform this forward push slowly and deliberately, and repeat it several times until you can consistently replicate the same smooth, controlled motion with unwavering precision.
Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): Next, isolate the lateral component by practicing the tap keystroke. From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a small, controlled lateral motion until it gently taps the supporting surface. Visualize how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Synchronize each lateral tap with deep, controlled breathing: inhale deeply before initiating the lateral shift, and exhale slowly as you complete the tap. To further enhance your precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each lateral movement. Drill this lateral tap repeatedly—aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side—until the tap keystroke becomes completely ingrained in your muscle memory.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: After mastering the lateral tap, focus on the lowering phase. Following each lateral tap, slowly lower your dropped hip until it gently contacts the supporting surface. Concentrate on how the underbelly of your penis begins to apply steady, cumulative pressure against her lower vaginal wall, while the upper shelf maintains consistent contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle—retract your body in a controlled manner so that your penis remains in constant contact with her north wall as you reset your position without fully withdrawing. Repeat the complete sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times until every transition flows seamlessly and every micro‑movement is performed exactly according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout your drilling session, maintain deep, deliberate breathing. Each deep inhale should sharpen your focus and prepare your body for the next precise movement, while every controlled exhale ensures smooth, natural transitions between phases. With disciplined, consistent practice, your natural mesomorph agility combined with your above‑7‑inch extension will merge into a series of perfectly executed, cumulative movements that become second nature.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—this is where the true art of the Bata Coxa Stroke emerges. Return to your starting position in your modified plank, with your knees firmly planted, core fully engaged, and your focus entirely on creating a fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this module, you’ll merge your forward push, lateral taps (using the tap keystroke), controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle into one unified, rhythmic cycle that forms the distinctive “W” pattern of the stroke.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward—moving steadily north toward your partner’s head. As you do so, ensure that the top shelf of your extended penis continuously glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push is critical as it sets up the baseline for cumulative stimulation and must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with about 80% of your force directed to the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase. Execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip in the practiced tap keystroke. With every lateral tap, focus on how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Once these lateral taps are executed perfectly, gradually lower your dropped hip so that the underbelly of your penis maintains steady, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf stays in continuous contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle until you return to your starting position, ensuring your penis remains in constant contact with her north wall throughout the retraction.
After completing one full cycle on one side, reset and mirror the entire sequence on the opposite side. Now, raise your right hip laterally and perform three deliberate lateral taps—ensuring that the right side of your penis engages the left vaginal opening while the left side delivers a complementary, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Lower your hip in a controlled manner and then shuttle backward until you return to your original starting position. This alternating “walking” motion creates the rhythmic “W” pattern that defines the Bata Coxa Stroke, delivering balanced cumulative stimulation in strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated sequence, let your deep, rhythmic breathing serve as your internal metronome—each deep inhale primes you for the next micro‑movement, and each controlled exhale smooths transitions between phases. With every complete cycle, your natural mesomorph precision and extended reach merge into a continuous, fluid performance—a Bata Coxa Stroke that is scientifically optimized and intimately powerful.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our focus is on fine‑tuning every micro‑adjustment of your Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal, cumulative stimulation. With your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every movement must be executed with impeccable precision to adhere entirely to the 80‑10‑10 principle—approximately 80% of your applied force should target the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining force is evenly distributed between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you cycle through your integrated routine, observe every nuance of your performance. During the forward push, verify that the top shelf of your extended penis consistently glides over her clitoral region, and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, while executing your lateral taps using the tap keystroke, pay close attention to the natural, subtle rocking motion generated by your controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even the slightest change in your lateral angle can significantly alter the cumulative stimulation. Experiment with minor adjustments—a change of one or two degrees in your hip drop—and carefully note how these modifications affect the overall pressure distribution and rocking effect. Use your partner’s feedback—her deep, rhythmic breathing, soft verbal cues, and subtle bodily responses—as critical data points. This iterative process of defining your objective, forming a hypothesis for slight modifications, meticulously tracking the outcomes, and refining your technique is at the core of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout every cycle. Each deep inhale should energize your next movement, while every controlled exhale facilitates smooth, natural transitions between phases. Over time, as you continuously monitor your internal sensations (such as core engagement and pelvic floor contraction) and your partner’s responses, you’ll eventually reach a state of flow—a seamless, automatic performance where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve this state of flow, your Bata Coxa Stroke becomes a natural, rhythmic expression of scientifically optimized, cumulative stimulation.
Remember, brother, every tiny adjustment counts. Your athletic mesomorph structure, combined with a balanced extension between 5 and 7 inches, provides an ideal platform for delivering focused, intense stimulation. Continuously track your internal cues and your partner’s responses, and refine your technique until every micro‑movement is executed with perfect consistency and precision.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a structured and disciplined training regimen designed to reinforce every element of the Bata Coxa Stroke while simultaneously strengthening the core and overall stability essential for your athletic mesomorph build and a penis size between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your comprehensive roadmap for transforming your natural strength and agility into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically optimized stimulation.
Begin by establishing your dedicated training space—a quiet, private area free from distractions, where you can focus solely on mastering your technique. Every training session should begin with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically for your mesomorph physique. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back, as these areas provide the fundamental support necessary for every precise micro‑movement during the Bata Coxa Stroke. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the detailed work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for your session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target the individual components of the stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees securely planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis size between 5 and 7 inches, each lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Synchronize every movement with deliberate, deep breathing—inhaling deeply before you initiate the lateral shift and exhaling slowly as you complete the tap. To further enhance your precision, incorporate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor with each lateral tap. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke becomes ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve mastered the lateral tap, integrate it with the vertical components. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a sequence of lateral taps and then a smooth, gradual backward shuttle, ensuring that every micro‑movement adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this fully integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition flows naturally and your cumulative stimulation is optimized. To further boost your stability and precision, supplement your stroke‑specific drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises—such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills—as these are critical to maintaining both the balance and control required for the Bata Coxa Stroke. Finally, keep a detailed training journal where you record each session’s repetitions, note any slight adjustments you try, and track the feedback from your partner. This journal is an indispensable part of the Sexual Scientific Process, allowing you to monitor progress and continually refine your performance.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural athletic mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of your disciplined practice, where your athletic mesomorph build and your penis size between 5 and 7 inches converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core engaged, and your mind entirely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your penis continuously glides over her clitoral region, and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward drive must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle—approximately 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone, while the remaining force is carefully balanced to engage the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your right hip. Raise your hip in a controlled, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps. With each tap, focus intently on how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface provides a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. If any lateral tap seems inconsistent—if the pressure is uneven or the angle slightly off—pause and isolate that movement, then drill it repeatedly until your internal feedback and your partner’s subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced in line with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Next, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, pay close attention to the contraction of your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor, and listen closely for any subtle cues from your partner. This troubleshooting phase is critical; if you notice that the cumulative stimulation isn’t optimal, make slight adjustments—perhaps a minor tweak in your lateral angle or a small variation in the pace of your forward push—until your technique is refined to perfection. Use the iterative cycle of the Sexual Scientific Process: define your objective for that cycle, form a hypothesis regarding a slight modification, track the outcomes meticulously, and refine your technique accordingly.
Once you’re satisfied with your refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the entire cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation throughout the vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you reach that state, your Bata Coxa Stroke will stand as a testament to your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate finesse—a continuously flowing performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your achievement, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated training into an art form—a performance where every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your athletic mesomorph strength and balanced extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure with every movement. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Bata Coxa Stroke bring you ever closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
