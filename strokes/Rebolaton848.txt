Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Rebloation Stroke—an advanced technique designed to harness your natural power and turn your robust, full‑figured endomorphic build into a finely tuned instrument of cumulative, targeted pleasure. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to guide you through this program specifically crafted for endomorphs with a penis below 5 inches. Now, I know some might view a compact extension as a limitation, but let me tell you: every inch is packed with potential when leveraged with precision. Your solid, powerful frame provides you with an unyielding foundation and immense endurance. In this training program, we’re going to convert your inherent robustness into a smoothly executed Rebloation Stroke that builds stimulation gradually and methodically.
Imagine yourself standing confidently in your personal training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where all distractions simply cease to exist. Feel the firm, supportive ground under your feet, which mirrors the unwavering strength of your endomorphic build. Take several deep, deliberate breaths, drawing in pure, concentrated energy and exhaling out all tension. This room is your arena, brother—a place where your raw power is refined into a meticulously controlled performance that delivers cumulative pleasure with every measured movement.
We begin by modifying the classic missionary position to suit your strong, full‑figured body. You’ll start in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that’s built to support your substantial mass. This anchoring stance is critical—it locks your body in place so that every micro‑movement, from the careful rotation of your hips to the final lateral shift, can be executed with deliberate precision. With your endomorphic build, you generate a high level of force effortlessly. However, it’s essential that every movement is controlled and measured, so that your heavy, powerful energy is concentrated exactly where it will yield maximum pleasure without overloading her delicate, sensitive areas.
Once you’re anchored and stable, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Think of this deliberate insertion as the blueprint for your stroke—it sets the exact angles and pressure points that will guide every subsequent move. Your journey with the Rebloation Stroke unfolds in a clear, structured sequence: you begin with a smooth, deliberate forward push, followed by four individual hip rotations to the right, then four individual hip rotations to the left, and finally an additional lateral shift to the left to round out the pattern. With each individual hip rotation, the hilt of your penis applies a steady, consistent pressure across a defined segment of her vaginal opening, while the head shifts its orientation—initially directing stimulation toward one wall, then gradually switching to the opposite wall. This sequential, cumulative action is the essence of the Rebloation Stroke.
In your case, with a compact extension below 5 inches, precision is absolutely critical. You must ensure that approximately 80% of your force is dedicated to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), with the remaining 20% divided evenly between the mid‑depth (roughly 3–5 inches) and deep zones. This balanced force allocation is what builds cumulative stimulation without overwhelming any single area.
This module sets the groundwork for your training, brother. It shows you how to create the right environment, adopt the proper posture, and channel your heavy endomorphic power into a Rebloation Stroke that transforms raw force into a precisely controlled, cumulative performance. Today marks the beginning of turning your natural strength and endurance into a true work of intimate art.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, and Flow
Alright, brother, let’s dive deep into the core principles that provide the foundation for your Rebloation Stroke. In this module, we’ll cover the 80‑10‑10 principle, explain the Sexual Scientific Process (complete with tracking and flow), and discuss how these strategies integrate into a training regimen that hones every movement.
First, think of the 80‑10‑10 principle as your force‑distribution blueprint. The idea is that approximately 80% of the force you generate during stimulation should be focused on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance. This is the most sensitive area because it houses a high density of nerve endings, and so you need to deliver maximum, focused pressure here. The remaining 20% of your force is not wasted; instead, it’s divided evenly so that 10% is aimed at the mid‑depth zone (roughly 3 to 5 inches) and the other 10% is reserved for the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an endomorph with a compact extension below 5 inches, this precise distribution is key. Your robust build allows you to generate significant power, but with a compact extension, your challenge—and your opportunity—is to concentrate most of that power where it counts most, creating a cumulative buildup of stimulation without overdoing any single area.
Next comes the Sexual Scientific Process, which is a systematic, step‑by‑step method for refining your technique. It starts with defining a clear goal: perhaps you want to maximize the cumulative effect of each individual hip rotation, ensuring that every rotation adds an extra layer of precise stimulation. With your goal defined, you then form a hypothesis—maybe you suspect that a slower, more controlled rotation will optimize the pressure distribution. Then you move into the tracking phase. In tracking, you methodically perform around 30 repetitions for each segment of the stroke, paying close attention to your body’s cues—engaging your core, strengthening your pelvic floor—and most importantly, listening to your partner’s responses. Her deep, rhythmic breathing, subtle posture shifts, and soft verbal signals serve as immediate feedback. This tracking data enables you to fine-tune your rotations, adjusting your speed, angle, and pressure in real time to ensure that cumulative stimulation is maximized.
After you’ve gathered enough data from tracking, you then enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical state where every micro‑movement—from your controlled forward push to each precise hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically. When you’re in flow, your body moves intuitively and flawlessly, delivering the optimal pressure and timing that has been refined by your tracking. The process becomes as natural as breathing, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with each repetition.
Unlike some other techniques that may utilize a separate lateral drill, the keystrokes of the Rebloation Stroke are inherent in the hip rotations themselves. Training means isolating those individual rotations until they become second nature, then integrating them until the entire sequence flows continuously, building stimulation on every turn.
So, to recap, brother: the 80‑10‑10 principle directs 80% of your force to the sensitive shallow zone and splits the remaining force evenly between the mid‑depth and deep layers; the Sexual Scientific Process—through clear goal setting, hypothesis formation, tracking, and entering a state of flow—provides a scientific roadmap for refining your technique; and by drilling the specific hip rotation keystrokes repeatedly, you develop the muscle memory necessary to deliver cumulative, targeted stimulation consistently. With these core principles in place, you have the perfect foundation to master the Rebloation Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Rebloation Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Rebloation Stroke into every deliberate component so that you have a detailed blueprint for transforming your lean, agile ectomorphic qualities and compact extension into a rhythmic, cumulative performance. The Rebloation Stroke is performed in the classic missionary position—on top in a modified plank with your knees on the canvas, with your penis inserted at a controlled, downward diagonal angle. Once inserted, the stroke unfolds in a precise sequence: you perform four individual hip rotations to the right, then four individual hip rotations to the left, and finally, you finish with an additional lateral shift to the left.
Let’s start with the foundation: the forward push. From your securely anchored position, drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head in a smooth, deliberate push. Feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region while the head maintains continuous, intentional contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is below 5 inches, the 80‑10‑10 principle instructs you to concentrate approximately 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining force is distributed evenly between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This forward push establishes the cumulative base upon which the hip rotations will build stimulation.
Next, the stroke moves into its first phase: four individual hip rotations to the right. As you rotate your hips to the right, focus on the hilt of your penis applying steady pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment down to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, the head of your penis shifts its focus, initially directing pressure toward the southwestern wall and then gradually transitioning to the north‑western wall with each rotation. Each of these rotations is a discrete keystroke that layers stimulation incrementally, building a cumulative effect as the rotations progress.
After completing the right rotations, smoothly transition to the second phase: four individual hip rotations to the left. Mirror the process: as you rotate to the left, the hilt of your penis now applies pressure by canvassing from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head initially directs its force toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. This alternating pattern of right and left rotations creates a rhythmic cycle that ensures cumulative stimulation is distributed evenly across her vaginal opening.
Finally, the stroke concludes with one additional lateral shift to the left. This final move further consolidates the cumulative effect, ensuring that the stimulation reaches every section of her vaginal canal. Throughout the entire sequence, every movement is carefully executed in accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that approximately 80% of the force is concentrated on the most sensitive shallow zone, while the remaining force is balanced between the deeper layers.
This detailed deconstruction of the Rebloation Stroke provides you with a clear, step‑by‑step roadmap. It transforms your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension into a series of meticulously coordinated movements that build cumulative, targeted stimulation with every precise hip rotation and lateral shift.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each individual component of the Rebloation Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with absolute precision. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, you’re designed for rapid, fine-tuned actions—but every hip rotation must be controlled with laser-like accuracy. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and practice it repeatedly until it’s fully embedded in your muscle memory, always keeping the 80‑10‑10 principle as your guide.
Begin with the forward push drill. In your modified missionary position, with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that supports your lean build, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Then, slowly execute a forward push toward your partner’s head. Focus closely on the sensation—feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide effortlessly over her clitoral region while the head stays in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your asset is compact, ensure that about 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich area. Practice this move repeatedly until the forward push becomes smooth, steady, and completely automatic.
Next, isolate the hip rotation drills. Start with a single rotation to the right. In your anchored position, initiate one deliberate hip rotation to the right. As you rotate, concentrate on how the hilt of your penis applies pressure by canvassing from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, note how the head first directs pressure toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall. Perform that one rotation slowly, then pause, reset, and repeat it for at least 30 repetitions until the movement is engraved in your muscle memory. After you’ve perfected the right rotation, isolate and drill a single rotation to the left. As you rotate left, feel the hilt canvas smoothly from the north‑western to the south‑western segment while the head transitions from initially pointing toward the southeastern wall to shifting to the north‑eastern wall. Alternate these rotations until you achieve seamless transitions between right and left, always ensuring each move respects the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Then, work on the final lateral shift drill. This is the concluding movement that rounds out the stroke. Slowly and deliberately shift your entire body laterally to the left while keeping your force consistent with the 80‑10‑10 principle—about 80% of your energy remains focused on the shallow zone. Drill this movement until the lateral shift becomes as natural as the individual hip rotations.
Throughout all these drills, maintain deep, controlled breathing. Each deep inhale fuels the next precise move, and every measured exhale creates a smooth transition between drills. By rigorously repeating each keystroke—the forward push, the right and left hip rotations, and the lateral shift—you build the muscle memory and precision required to deliver cumulative stimulation flawlessly with your Rebloation Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, it’s time to bring together every drilled component into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Rebloation Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance—with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your whole focus on linking every micro‑movement into an unbroken, rhythmic sequence. In this integrated session, you combine your deliberate forward push with the sequence of four hip rotations to the right, followed by four hip rotations to the left, and finish the pattern with a lateral shift to the left.
Begin with the forward push. In your stable, anchored position, insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you push, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This foundational push adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle by focusing about 80% of your force on the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone, providing the cumulative base for your subsequent movements.
Immediately follow your forward push with the first phase: four individual hip rotations to the right. With each right rotation, focus on the hilt steadily canvassing the vaginal opening from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, while the head first directs pressure toward the southwestern wall and then transitions to the north‑western wall. Each rotation adds a layer to the cumulative stimulation.
Once you have completed the right rotations, transition seamlessly into the next phase: four individual hip rotations to the left. As you rotate left, let the hilt move from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and allow the head to change its direction from pointing toward the southeastern wall to shifting toward the north‑eastern wall. This alternating cycle ensures that the stimulation is distributed evenly across her vaginal canal.
Finally, complete the integrated sequence with a final lateral shift to the left. This conclusive movement further ensures that the cumulative effect reaches every area of her canal. Throughout the sequence, every action—whether it’s the forward push, each hip rotation, or the lateral shift—must conform to the 80‑10‑10 principle so that the majority of your force is focused on the shallow, sensitive zone, with balanced distribution into the deeper layers.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale fueling the next precise move, and every controlled exhale smoothing the transitions between movements. With every complete cycle, your Rebloation Stroke becomes a continuous, fluid performance that transforms your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension into a finely choreographed routine of cumulative, precise stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase—where every micro‑movement of your Rebloation Stroke is fine-tuned until your performance becomes a seamless, automatic masterpiece. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, every minute detail is crucial, particularly during those individual hip rotations. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains your guiding light: about 80% of your applied force must be concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you perform the integrated sequence, pay close attention to the quality and consistency of each action. During your forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your compact extension glides effortlessly over her clitoral region, and that the head remains in continuous, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When executing your four hip rotations to the right, and then to the left, monitor closely how the hilt canvasses the vaginal opening and how the head shifts its pressure—first directing it toward one wall, then adjusting to the opposite wall. This is where tracking becomes indispensable: each repetition provides you with immediate, real‑time feedback. Listen intently to her deep, rhythmic breathing; observe any subtle shifts in her posture; and note soft verbal cues that reveal which aspects of your stroke are delivering the best cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your critical feedback loop, allowing you to adjust your technique with pinpoint precision.
Once you’ve gathered sufficient tracking data—aim for approximately 30 repetitions per phase—you naturally transition into a state of flow. Flow is that nearly magical condition where every micro‑movement—from the forward push to each meticulously executed hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically, as if you were performing a perfectly choreographed dance. In this state, you deliver the exact pressure and timing that your tracking has helped you refine, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with every cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is essential during flow; each deep inhale prepares you for the next movement, and every controlled exhale smooths the transition. And if any rotational movement feels slightly off, take a moment to re-track her feedback and adjust until your technique is flawless.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to create your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined program that reinforces every element of your Rebloation Stroke while simultaneously building the core strength and overall stability essential for your ectomorphic build with a compact extension. Your natural agility and quick responsiveness are your key advantages, and this routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that delivers cumulative, precise stimulation every time.
First, set up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions vanish and your focus is fully on perfecting your technique. Every training session should begin with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your ectomorphic physique. Engage in dynamic stretches targeting your core, hips, and lower back—these vital muscle groups are the foundation of your stability and control, ensuring that every precise movement is executed with exactitude. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, priming every muscle and joint for the rapid, precise drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a determined, positive tone for the session.
Next, move into your specialized drills, beginning with the forward push. In your modified missionary position, carefully insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and practice a smooth, deliberate forward push toward your partner’s head. Since your extension is compact, concentrate about 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone. Once you have mastered that, isolate the individual hip rotations. Begin with the right rotations—practice each rotation slowly and with complete control until the hilt consistently canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, while the head shifts accurately from the southwestern to the north‑western wall. Perform at least 30 reps until it feels natural. Then, mirror the process with left hip rotations until you can execute them seamlessly. Finally, practice the concluding lateral shift that rounds out the stroke. Alternate these drills until each keystroke of the Rebloation Stroke is firmly ingrained in your muscle memory.
Throughout your training, maintain deep, controlled breathing to support every movement. Supplement your drills with core-strengthening exercises like planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability workouts—your strong core is the anchor that ensures every rapid action is executed with maximum precision. And don’t forget to keep a detailed training journal. Record every session, note the number of repetitions, document any adjustments you make, and capture her feedback. This journal is an indispensable tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, helping you track your progress and continuously refine your technique until it’s perfected.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—the apex of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Rebloation Stroke converges into one continuous, flawless performance. In this final module, your lean, agile ectomorphic build and compact extension come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of mastery that is both scientifically refined and profoundly satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified missionary stance—with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core fully engaged, and your mind honed for absolute precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is targeted on the ultra‑sensitive shallow vaginal zone, while the remaining force is balanced to stimulate the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately after the forward push, transition into the hip rotation phase by executing four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation, focus intently on the hilt applying steady, targeted pressure—canvas it from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening—while the head shifts, first directing pressure toward the southwestern wall and then transitioning to the north‑western wall. Once you complete the right rotations, seamlessly move into four individual hip rotations to the left, where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and the head initially points toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. Finally, complete the cycle with one controlled lateral shift to the left. Throughout the integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—every deep inhale fuels your next precise move, and every controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions.
If any component feels off—if a rotation lacks precision or the pressure distribution seems unbalanced—pause, re-track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is flawless. The ultimate goal is to enter a state of natural flow—a condition where every forward push, every hip rotation, and every lateral shift is performed automatically with impeccable precision and cumulative intensity. When that state is achieved, your Rebloation Stroke will become a continuous, fluid masterpiece—one that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers the targeted, cumulative stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every individual hip rotation, and every lateral shift is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your lean, agile ectomorphic build and compact extension will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Rebloation Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure every time. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Rebloation Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
