Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Walk Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m truly excited to guide you through this process. You, as an ectomorph with an above‑7‑inch extension, have a unique advantage: your lean, long‑limbed, agile build allows you to perform every movement with remarkable precision, while your extended asset gives you a wide area of stimulation that can be finely controlled. Today, we’re going to learn how to convert your natural attributes into an intimate performance that is both technically sharp and deeply connected.
Find a quiet spot where you can eliminate distractions. Sit down, relax your shoulders, and take several deep, steady breaths. Let my voice guide you into a focused mindset. In the Walk Stroke, you will be in the classic missionary position, but with a few important modifications. Imagine yourself on top, starting in a modified plank position with your knees planted firmly on a stable surface—this anchors your lean ectomorphic frame so that every subtle shift becomes deliberate and controlled. With your penis inserted at a downward diagonal angle, you begin by moving your entire body in a forward, “northward” direction toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, the top shelf of your extended shaft gently massages her clitoral region, while the head of your penis consistently caresses her “south wall.” This initial forward movement is not just about making contact—it’s designed to prime the stimulation following the crucial 80‑10‑10 principle, which directs approximately 80% of your applied stimulation to the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, with the remaining force evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep zones.
After that initial phase, you’ll transition into the lateral part of the stroke. Here, you’ll lift one hip in a controlled “tap” motion. For instance, raise your right hip laterally so that the right side of your shaft applies deliberate pressure to the left part of your partner’s vaginal opening, while the left side, utilizing a subtle rocking action, engages the right internal wall. Then, you lower that same hip gradually, allowing the underbelly of your penis to apply gentle pressure toward her lower wall, while the upper shelf continues its consistent contact with her upper wall. Without completely withdrawing your penis, you then slowly shuttle your body backward so that the head maintains continuous contact with the north wall. Once you return to your starting position, you mirror the process on the opposite side—raising your left hip, tapping, lowering, and shuttling back—thereby creating a “walking” motion with your hips. Each step of this sequence is a carefully engineered movement that, when repeated, builds cumulative and balanced stimulation.
Today’s session is about setting the stage for everything that follows. We’ll focus on transforming your natural ectomorphic agility and extended reach into a precise, rhythmically integrated performance. Every micro‑movement—from the forward push to the lateral tap and the controlled hip drop—will be executed with technical and emotional precision. This is not just a set of movements, brother; it’s a systematic approach to turning raw physical attributes into an art form. Welcome again, and let’s begin channeling your extended, graceful energy into intimate mastery.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding Your Unique Profile and Anatomy
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re going to take a deep dive into your unique anatomical profile as an ectomorph with an above‑7‑inch extension, and understand how these features affect your Walk Stroke. You’re naturally lean and long‑limbed, which gives you the ability to make fast, precise, and graceful movements. However, with your extended asset, every micro‑adjustment carries even more weight. It’s essential that you learn to control each movement so that the stimulation is delivered optimally according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Imagine your body as a finely tuned instrument with long, slender limbs that move with precision. Your ectomorphic structure means you have excellent proprioception—you can feel every subtle contraction in your core and every minor shift in your balance. This sensitivity is a huge advantage when executing the Walk Stroke because even the slightest adjustment can change the intensity and distribution of stimulation. In technical terms, the 80‑10‑10 principle requires that about 80% of your applied force focuses on the shallow vaginal zone (roughly the first 1 to 3 inches, where nerve endings are densely populated), while the remaining 20% is split equally between the mid‑depth and deep regions. For you, this means that every forward push, every lateral tap, must be calibrated perfectly to ensure that the shallow zone receives the majority of the stimulation without neglecting deeper areas.
Your extended asset actually provides you with more surface area, which allows you to experiment with various angles and pressures. However, it also demands greater precision: you must be particularly mindful of your forward momentum, as well as the lateral shifts which are executed via the tap keystroke. This foundational drill trains your body to achieve that small, controlled lateral movement that becomes the building block of the full stroke. In your case, with an above‑7‑inch extension, the pressure applied during these lateral movements can be very effective when controlled precisely. You need to harness your natural lean muscle tone and agile reflexes so that every movement is not only fluid but also consistent with the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Consider also the importance of integrating the Sexual Scientific Process into your technique. This involves defining a clear goal for each stroke, hypothesizing which adjustments (such as altering your lateral angle slightly) might maximize stimulation, and then tracking the feedback from your partner’s responses—every cue helps you fine‑tune your method. By understanding your body fully, you’ll learn how to adapt your natural ectomorphic advantages to deliver a performance that’s both scientifically sound and intimately engaging.
Remember, brother, your unique profile is an asset. With your long limbs, lean frame, and extended reach, you have the potential to create a stimulating, cumulative performance when every movement is executed with precision. This module is about honing your self‑awareness so that you can make every micro‑movement work to your advantage in the Walk Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Walk Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Now it’s time to break down the Walk Stroke into its core components. Picture yourself in your classic missionary stance—on top in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface. With your ectomorphic build and above‑7‑inch extension, every micro‑movement must be precise. We’ll isolate each phase so that you can master it individually before integrating them into a full, flowing performance.
The sequence begins with the forward movement. Start by inserting your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle. As you initiate the stroke, move your entire body north toward your partner’s head. In this forward motion, the top shelf of your extended shaft is designed to gently massage her clitoral region, while the head of your penis provides consistent contact with her south wall. This movement is fundamental because it primes the stimulation pattern in accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle. You must direct roughly 80% of your force to the shallow, nerve‑rich area while still engaging the mid‑depth and deep zones, albeit with less intensity.
Once the forward motion is complete, the stroke moves into the lateral phase. From your forward position, you perform a controlled lateral shift by raising your right hip. This small, deliberate movement is known as the tap keystroke—a critical drill that trains your body to execute precise lateral taps. As your right hip lifts, the right side of your shaft applies firm pressure on the left part of her vaginal opening, while the left side initiates a gentle, oscillatory rocking effect on her right internal wall. This lateral “tap” is repeated three times in succession; each tap must be executed with enough force to maintain the stimulation pattern but controlled enough to adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
After the lateral taps, you gradually lower the raised hip toward the canvas. This lowering phase allows the underbelly of your penis to apply controlled pressure on the lower wall, while the upper shelf continues its contact with the upper wall. As you slowly shuttle your body backward, your penis remains in contact with the north wall, ensuring that stimulation is maintained continuously. Then, you reset to the starting position and mirror the entire process on the opposite side—raising your left hip, executing the tap keystroke, lowering, and shuttling back—thus ensuring that every side of her vaginal canal receives balanced stimulation.
By deconstructing the Walk Stroke into these distinct phases—forward movement, lateral tapping via the tap keystroke, controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttling—you can focus on perfecting each segment. This methodical breakdown ensures that every movement is executed with precision and in accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle, forming the blueprint for a complete, integrated performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each individual component of the Walk Stroke until every movement becomes second nature. With your ectomorphic frame and above‑7‑inch extension, precision is key. In this module, we’ll focus on repetitive training of the forward movement, the lateral tap, and the controlled lowering and shuttle, ensuring that each micro‑adjustment is executed flawlessly.
Start with the forward movement. Assume your modified plank position—with your knees firmly on the canvas—and insert your penis at the precise downward diagonal angle. Slowly push your body forward, moving north toward your partner’s head. As you do so, feel the top shelf of your extended shaft glide over her clitoral area, while the head maintains consistent contact with her south wall. Concentrate on how you distribute your force: approximately 80% of your pressure should engage the shallow zone, while the remaining 20% is carefully allocated to the mid‑depth and deep zones. Repeat this forward drive several times until you can execute it smoothly and reliably.
Next, isolate the lateral component—the tap keystroke drill. From the forward position, raise your right hip in a small, controlled motion until it lightly taps the surface. As this happens, envision the right side of your shaft pressing firmly against the left part of her vaginal opening, while the left side creates a gentle, rhythmic rocking sensation on her right internal wall. Synchronize each lateral tap with deep, measured breathing. Inhale as you prepare to shift; exhale as you complete the tap. Incorporate kegeling at this stage by contracting your pelvic floor muscles, thereby enhancing your internal control and ensuring that each tap delivers precise, cumulative pressure. Practice this drill repeatedly—aim for at least 30 slow, deliberate repetitions on each side—until the lateral movement is ingrained in your muscle memory.
Then, focus on the lowering phase. After executing your lateral tap, gradually lower your raised hip toward the canvas. As you do this, concentrate on how the underbelly of your penis begins to press gently against her lower wall, while the upper shelf maintains steady contact with the upper wall. Follow this with a slow, controlled backward shuttle that resets your position, ensuring that your penis continues to massage the north wall during the extraction. Drill the entire sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—until every transition becomes fluid and automatic, perfectly adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout your training session, keep your breathing deep and synchronized with your movements. Every inhale should bring you clarity and focus, and every exhale should help you release tension, allowing each micro‑movement to flow seamlessly into the next. With rigorous drilling, your ectomorphic agility combined with your extended reach will evolve into a set of actions that are executed with relentless precision and cumulative effect.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one seamless, rhythmic performance—that’s where the Walk Stroke truly comes alive. In this module, you’ll blend the forward movement, the lateral tap keystroke, the controlled hip lowering, and the backward shuttle into a continuous sequence that looks and feels like natural walking of the hips.
Return to your starting position in your modified plank—knees firmly on the surface, core fully engaged, and your mind locked on fluidity. Begin with the forward movement: insert your penis at the designated downward diagonal and move your body north toward your partner’s head. Feel the top shelf of your extended shaft continuously caressing her clitoral area, while the head of your penis maintains contact with her south wall, applying the critical 80‑10‑10 distribution of stimulation throughout this phase.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by raising your right hip for a series of three precise lateral taps. Each tap must be executed with control; as your right hip lifts, your right side delivers targeted pressure to the left side of her vaginal opening, and your left side subtly initiates a rocking massage on her right internal wall. Ensure that every lateral tap adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle—80% of the force focused on the shallow zone, with a careful balance into deeper regions. Then, gradually lower your right hip so that the underbelly of your penis applies gentle, cumulative pressure on her lower wall, while the upper shelf keeps consistent contact with her upper wall. Now, slowly shuttle your body backward until you return to your original starting position, keeping your penis in constant contact with the north wall.
Once you’ve completed this cycle on the right side, mirror the entire sequence on the left side. Raise your left hip laterally, perform three controlled lateral taps (this time with the left side engaging the right vaginal opening and the right side providing a gentle rocking effect on her left internal wall), lower the hip steadily, and shuttle backward. The alternating pattern—the “walking” motion of your hips—creates a rhythmic, cumulative performance that is fluid and continuous.
Throughout the integrated sequence, let your breathing be your guide. Every deep inhale prepares you for the next movement, and every steady exhale helps to smooth the transition between phases. The result is a performance where each element flows into the next without interruption—a true state of flow, where your ectomorphic precision and above‑7‑inch extension come together to create a seamless expression of cumulative stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, we focus on refining every micro‑adjustment in the Walk Stroke to ensure that your performance consistently delivers optimal stimulation. With your ectomorphic build and above‑7‑inch extension, you possess remarkable reach and agility, but every movement must be calibrated to respect the 80‑10‑10 principle and to create a perfect balance between forward momentum, precise lateral taps, and gentle backward shuttling.
As you execute each complete cycle of the Walk Stroke, remember that around 80% of your force must be concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% should be evenly allocated between the mid‑depth and deep zones. As you progress, be hyper‑aware of the slight rocking motion that your lateral taps generate. These small, controlled hops create a natural oscillation—a rocking effect that enhances stimulation by allowing subtle angling adjustments. Experiment with slight modifications in your lateral angle; even a one‑degree shift can significantly alter how the stimulation is delivered. As part of the Sexual Scientific Process, define your target (for example, achieving a smoother rocking sensation on a particular wall), form your hypothesis by adjusting your lateral movement slightly, and then track your partner’s responses through her body language and verbal cues.
Your deep, rhythmic breathing is your constant companion during this process. Inhale deeply to set each movement in motion, and exhale steadily as you complete each transition. With every cycle, pay close attention to internal cues: the contraction of your core, the subtle engagement of your pelvic floor, and the natural flow of your body. These cues tell you if you’re applying the right balance of force according to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Over time, as you track these signals and fine‑tune your technique, you will enter a state of flow—a level of performance where each lateral tap, forward push, and backward shuttle is executed automatically and in perfect rhythm.
The ongoing loop of defining your goals, hypothesizing adjustments, tracking feedback, and refining your movements is the essence of the Sexual Scientific Process. It ensures that your Walk Stroke is not only consistent but also evolves into a highly responsive performance that adapts to the nuances of your partner’s reactions and your own internal sensations. This advanced refinement phase is where your ectomorphic agility and extended reach truly shine, transforming every subtle movement into a cumulative, scientifically precise delivery of intimate stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, let’s build your personalized practice routine—your very own training blueprint that reinforces every aspect of the Walk Stroke while strengthening the core which is absolutely essential for your ectomorphic precision and above‑7‑inch extension. This module is about developing a disciplined regimen that transforms your natural agility and long reach into a consistently refined, cumulative performance.
Start by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet area where you can focus solely on your technique. Begin each session with an extensive warm‑up specifically designed for your lean, ectomorphic frame. Engage in dynamic stretching that targets your core, hips, and lower back. Visualize each stretch as a signal to your body that it’s time to activate every finely tuned muscle, preparing you for the precise movements of the Walk Stroke. As you complete your warm‑up, take a moment to center your mind with a few deep, steady breaths.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target the individual elements of the Walk Stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position with your knees securely planted, practice small, controlled lateral taps. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface, then return to the center. Coordinate each tap with deliberate breathing—inhaling before the tap, exhaling as you complete the movement. Integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each tap to lock in that precise pressure and build internal control. Perform at least 30 repetitions on each side until these lateral motions become smooth and automatic.
After refining the lateral component, integrate it with the vertical movements. Execute a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and then a gentle backward shuttle—all while ensuring continuous contact and adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this complete sequence repeatedly on both sides. Supplement these stroke‑specific drills with dedicated core-strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stabilization drills. These exercises are the backbone of your routine, fortifying your core so that every micro‑movement is supported by maximum stability and control.
Keep a detailed training journal to record every session. Note the number of repetitions, any minor adjustments you experiment with, and the feedback you receive from your partner. This documentation is a vital part of the Sexual Scientific Process, as it helps you track progress, identify what works, and continually refine your technique. Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery—a plan that turns raw ectomorphic agility and above‑7‑inch extension into a performance that is fluid, controlled, and powerfully stimulating.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to bringing every component of the Walk Stroke together into one seamless, fluid performance and troubleshooting any imperfections along the way. This module is where every drilled component, every subtle adjustment, coalesces into an expression of intimate mastery that is both scientifically sound and deeply responsive to your partner’s cues.
Begin your advanced session by setting up your training space with absolute focus. Assume your starting position confidently—on top in your modified plank, with your knees firmly planted, your core engaged, and your mind attuned entirely to precision. Start the cycle with a slow, controlled forward movement toward your partner’s head. As you do this, ensure that the top shelf of your extended shaft consistently caresses her clitoral region while the head keeps constant, deliberate contact with her south wall. This forward motion must adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with the majority of your force directed into the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by initiating the tap keystroke. Raise your right hip in a controlled, compact shift, executing a series of three precise lateral taps. During each tap, ensure that the pressure from the right side of your shaft is directed squarely against the left portion of her vaginal opening, while the left side delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage to her right internal wall. If you notice any inconsistencies in your taps—such as uneven pressure or a slightly off angle—pause and isolate that specific motion. Drill that segment until the feedback from your internal sensations and your partner’s responses confirm that the stimulation is balanced perfectly according to the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Then, perform a controlled vertical pushout that gradually resets your position. As you extend upward, use the moment to listen to your body—feel the contraction of your core, the engagement of your pelvic floor, and even the soft cues from your partner. This is your opportunity to troubleshoot any minor deviations. Maybe a slight modification in your lateral angle or a slower forward push is needed to achieve the ideal stimulation. Use the iterative loop of the Sexual Scientific Process: define your goal for that cycle, hypothesize a precise adjustment, track the outcome through careful observation, and refine your technique accordingly.
Repeat the complete integrated cycle—forward motion, lateral taps, vertical pushout—and then mirror the sequence on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation across all walls. The final goal is to reach a state of flow where every micro‑adjustment is automatic, where your ectomorphic agility and above‑7‑inch extension come together in a seamless, continuously rhythmic performance. Celebrate reaching this state, brother, as it marks your evolution into a master of the Walk Stroke.
Happy training, and remember that every single refined repetition takes you closer to an effortless, scientifically optimized performance. Your journey toward intimate mastery is ongoing, and each flawlessly executed cycle is a testament to your dedication, precision, and passion.
