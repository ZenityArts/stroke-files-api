Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the very start of your transformational journey with the Bata Coxa Stroke! I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to work with you—an endomorph with a penis below 5 inches. Your body is built for endurance and power: a robust, full‑figured frame that provides you with a naturally stable base. Although your extension is compact, every inch is highly sensitive, and when handled with precision, it can deliver remarkably cumulative stimulation. Today, we’re going to harness that raw power and convert it into a carefully choreographed sequence that transforms your natural strengths into a rhythmic performance designed to maximize pleasure.
Before we begin, find a quiet, comfortable space where you can focus completely without any distractions—your training area is your sanctuary. Sit back or lie down, relax your broad shoulders, and take several deep, slow breaths until your mind is calm and your body is ready for focused practice. Our technique today is a modified version of the classic missionary setup. We start in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface; this is essential for your full‑figured endomorph build, as it anchors your heavier frame and allows you to execute each movement with deliberate control.
Next, insert your penis at a precisely calculated downward diagonal angle. This initial positioning is critical because it lays the groundwork for the entire stroke. From this starting point, begin by executing a smooth forward push—moving your entire body steadily northward toward your partner’s head. During this forward phase, the top shelf of your compact penis should glide gently over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is below 5 inches, it is crucial that you concentrate most of your applied force on the shallow zone. We apply the 80‑10‑10 principle here: roughly 80% of your stimulation should target the shallow, nerve‑rich area (roughly the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining 20% is evenly divided between the mid‑depth (approximately 3–5 inches) and deep (beyond 5 inches) zones. This controlled force distribution ensures that you maximize stimulation exactly where it’s most effective—without overwhelming the deeper regions.
After the initial forward push, the stroke transitions into the lateral phase, which forms the core “W” pattern of the Bata Coxa Stroke. In this phase, you’ll work primarily with your left hip. Given your full‑figured, heavy‑set build, you have the inherent stability to drop your left hip in a slow, deliberate movement. As you drop your left hip toward the canvas, the hilt (or base) of your penis applies consistent pressure to the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening. Simultaneously, your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right. This intentional reorientation creates friction that gently massages her right wall in an upward, heating motion. After this controlled drop, you then raise your left hip back toward center—this reversal helps to shift the cumulative stimulation across the vaginal opening in a balanced manner. You’ll continue this drop-and-raise sequence—sometimes with variations in pace to modify friction—and then complete the cycle with a backward shuttle that resets your position while maintaining continuous stimulation.
This introduction sets the stage for transforming your robust endomorphic power and compact extension into a meticulously controlled performance. Every forward push, every lateral drop and raise, and each backward shuttle is executed with deliberate precision to ensure that the majority of your stimulation is focused on that vital shallow zone, while still engaging deeper tissues with gentle continuity. Welcome, brother—let’s begin turning your natural strength into an artful expression of cumulative, intimate mastery with the Bata Coxa Stroke!
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding Your Unique Profile and Anatomy
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re diving deep into understanding your unique anatomical profile as an endomorph with a penis below 5 inches and how these characteristics define your execution of the Bata Coxa Stroke. Your body is robust and heavy‑set, built for endurance and power, with broad shoulders, a thick core, and a naturally stable frame. These features give you the ability to deliver strong, deliberate force through every movement. However, your compact extension means that the area available for stimulation is confined, necessitating precision in every micro‑movement.
Imagine your body as a powerhouse that is finely tuned for both stability and consistent pressure. Your full‑figured build means that you possess inherent strength and endurance, which enable you to maintain controlled, powerful movements over extended periods. Yet, your penis being below 5 inches means that you need to concentrate the majority of your force into a smaller, more sensitive area—the shallow zone of the vaginal canal. This is where the 80‑10‑10 principle comes into play: about 80% of your applied force should be directed to the shallow zone (roughly the first 1 to 3 inches), where the nerve endings are densest, while only 10% each should spread to the mid‑depth (around 3–5 inches) and the deep zones. This ensures that your stimulation is maximized where it’s most effective.
Your endomorphic structure provides you with high stability and a grounded base, which is essential for executing heavy, controlled movements. Because your body is naturally robust, every forward push and lateral shift can be performed with great force. However, due to the compact nature of your extension, these powerful moves must be executed with exceptional precision. It is vital that each micro‑movement is measured, so that the overwhelming majority of the stimulation is funneled into the shallow zone, while still inviting a gentle touch to deeper areas.
Additionally, a key aspect of refining your technique is using the Sexual Scientific Process. This involves setting clear goals for your stroke (for example, ensuring that the top shelf of your compact penis consistently grazes her clitoral region), forming a hypothesis about what slight changes might yield better outcomes (like adjusting the angle or pace of your lateral drop), and then tracking your partner’s responses during repeated strokes—ideally, performing at least 30 repetitions on each “wall.” Through systematic tracking and data gathering, you can then refine your technique until every cycle is optimized for cumulative stimulation.
Your robust endomorphic build, combined with your compact extension, is a unique asset, brother. While you have the power to deliver strong force due to your natural build, the key to exceptional performance lies in the precision with which you apply that force. By fully understanding and embracing the 80‑10‑10 principle, along with the systematic approach of the Sexual Scientific Process, you can achieve a stroke that is both powerful and finely controlled. This deep anatomical insight is your blueprint for evolving raw strength into a refined performance that consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. Embrace your unique qualities and let them guide every movement as you perfect the Bata Coxa Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, it’s time to break down the Bata Coxa Stroke into its fundamental components so you can master each element individually before combining them into one seamless performance. Picture yourself in the missionary position once again—on top in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable canvas. With your robust endomorphic build and a penis below 5 inches, every micro‑movement is critical in ensuring precise, cumulative stimulation. We’re going to isolate each phase of the stroke so you gain complete control and can execute every detail with perfect timing.
Forward Movement: The stroke begins by inserting your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. From there, you slowly push your entire body forward—moving northward toward your partner’s head. During this forward push, the top shelf of your compact penis glides gently over her clitoral area, while the head maintains consistent, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward drive is foundational as it primes the stimulation area. According to the 80‑10‑10 principle, approximately 80% of your force should be focused on the shallow, sensitive vaginal zone (roughly the first 1 to 3 inches). Because your extension is compact, every inch of forward movement must be executed with absolute precision to maximize stimulation without over‑penetrating the deeper tissues.
Lateral Phase (Left Hip Drop): After the forward movement, the stroke transitions into the lateral phase. From your forward position, initiate a controlled lateral shift by dropping your left hip toward the canvas. In this phase, the hilt (base) of your penis applies focused pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right, generating friction and a gentle rocking massage along her right vaginal wall. As you shuttle laterally—moving upward toward her head—this drop produces cumulative stimulation, precisely engaging the shallow zone. The lateral shift is executed using the tap keystroke, which demands small, deliberate movements. It is critical that you perform the lateral drop with meticulous control, as the compactness of your extension requires that the bulk of the force is applied to the sensitive shallow area.
Hip Raise to Center (Reversal): Immediately after the left hip drop, raise your left hip back toward the center. This reversal shifts the cumulative stimulation: the hilt now applies pressure beginning from the western section of the vaginal opening and moving up toward the northern section, while your penis reorients so that it points directly north—massaging upward from the northern wall to the eastern wall. This reversal is vital, as it integrates the stimulation from the preceding lateral phase and maintains a smooth, rhythmic balance. Every raise is executed with care, ensuring that the force remains aligned with the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Cycle Repetition and Variations: The stroke continues by repeating the drop-and-raise sequence. You execute another left hip drop in a similar manner—focusing on directing pressure from the northern to the western sections as your penis points east and massages upward from the eastern to the northern wall. After that, you may vary the pace by raising your left hip only halfway toward the center at a faster pace. This quicker movement introduces a subtle variation in the friction, increasing the cumulative stimulation in a different pattern. Then, you drop once more and repeat that half-raise and drop cycle to further intensify the stimulation. Finally, complete the sequence by fully raising your left hip back to center, so that the hilt applies uniform pressure from the western section through to the northern section, with your penis pointing north and massaging upward from the northern wall to the eastern wall. At this point, the entire stroke resets and is repeated continuously.
This deconstruction of the Bata Coxa Stroke into these individual components—forward push, lateral drop using the tap keystroke, controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle—provides you with a clear, detailed roadmap. Each movement is performed with exact precision to satisfy the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that your compact extension delivers optimal stimulation to the shallow zone while gently engaging deeper tissues. This blueprint is the foundation for transforming your raw, endomorphic power into a refined, cumulative performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each individual component of the Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as breathing. With your robust endomorphic build and a penis below 5 inches, precision, control, and consistency are absolutely essential. In this module, we’re going to perform repetitive, intensive practice of each segmented phase—starting with the forward push, then the lateral drop (tap keystroke), followed by controlled hip lowering, and finishing with the backward shuttle—making sure that every repetition adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Forward Movement Drill: First, assume your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface to support your full‑figured, robust frame. Insert your penis at the predetermined downward diagonal angle, and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus intently on the sensation: feel the top shelf of your compact penis glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is compact, it’s imperative that about 80% of your applied force is focused on stimulating the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. Execute this forward push slowly and deliberately, and repeat the movement several times until you can replicate the same smooth, controlled motion with unwavering precision.
Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): Next, isolate the lateral component. From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a small, controlled lateral movement until your hip gently touches the canvas. Visualize the mechanics: as you drop your left hip, the hilt of your penis applies targeted, focused pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates slightly so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a subtle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Coordinate each lateral tap with deep, controlled breathing; inhale before initiating the lateral drop, and exhale slowly as you complete the tap. To further build precision and control, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor with each lateral movement. Drill this lateral tap repeatedly—aim for at least 30 slow, deliberate repetitions on each side—until the movement becomes a natural, ingrained part of your routine.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: After perfecting your lateral tap, focus on the lowering phase. Following each lateral tap, slowly lower your dropped hip until it gently contacts the supporting surface. Concentrate on the sensation: feel the underbelly of your penis begin to apply controlled, cumulative pressure to her lower wall while the upper shelf maintains steady contact with her upper wall. Then, practice the backward shuttle—slowly retract your body in a controlled, deliberate manner so that your penis remains in constant contact with her north wall as you reset your position without fully withdrawing. Repeat the complete sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times until every transition is smooth and every micro‑movement follows exactly the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Maintain deep, deliberate breathing throughout your drilling session. Each deep inhale should sharpen your focus and prepare your body for the upcoming movement, while each controlled exhale ensures a smooth and natural transition between phases. With disciplined, repetitive practice, your robust endomorphic power and compact extension will blend into a series of precise, cumulative movements that become second nature.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance. This is where the art of the Bata Coxa Stroke truly emerges. Return to your starting position in your modified plank—with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your mind focused solely on creating a fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this module, we’ll merge your forward push, lateral taps (executed via the tap keystroke), controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle into one unified, rhythmic cycle that forms the signature “W” pattern of the stroke.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle, and slowly push your entire body forward—moving steadily north toward your partner’s head. As you do so, ensure that the top shelf of your compact penis consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward drive sets the baseline for cumulative stimulation and must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with about 80% of your force directed to the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase. Execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip in that practiced tap keystroke. Focus intently on how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Once these lateral taps are complete, gradually lower your dropped hip so that the underbelly of your penis applies steady, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf remains in continuous contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a smooth, deliberate backward shuttle until you return to your starting position, ensuring that your penis remains in uninterrupted contact with her north wall throughout.
After completing one full cycle on one side, reset and mirror the entire sequence on the opposite side. Now, raise your right hip laterally and perform three deliberate lateral taps—with the right side of your penis engaging the left vaginal opening and the left side delivering a rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall—then lower your hip in a controlled manner and shuttle backward until you’re back at your original starting position. This alternating “walking” motion of your hips creates the rhythmic “W” pattern that is the hallmark of the Bata Coxa Stroke, delivering balanced, cumulative stimulation that adheres perfectly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated routine, allow your deep, rhythmic breathing to serve as your internal metronome: each deep inhale primes your body for the next micro‑movement, and each controlled exhale facilitates smooth transitions between phases. With every complete cycle, your natural ectomorphic finesse and compact extension converge into a continuous, fluid performance—a Bata Coxa Stroke that is both scientifically optimized and deeply intimate.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our aim is to fine‑tune every micro‑adjustment of your Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your lean ectomorphic build and a penis size between 5 and 7 inches, precision is critical—every movement must be executed with exactness to maintain the 80‑10‑10 principle. This means ensuring that approximately 80% of your applied force is directed to the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone while the remaining 20% is equally distributed between the mid‑depth and deep zones.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, pay close attention to every detail of your performance. During the forward push, verify that the top shelf of your compact penis glides consistently over her clitoral region while the head maintains steady, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you execute the lateral taps using the tap keystroke, observe the natural, subtle rocking motion produced by your controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even the slightest variation in your lateral angle can have a significant impact on cumulative stimulation. Experiment with minor adjustments—a slight change of one or two degrees in your hip drop—and carefully note how these variations affect the overall pressure and rocking effect. Use your partner’s feedback—her deeper, rhythmic breathing, soft verbal cues, or subtle body movements—as essential data points. This iterative process—defining your objective, forming a hypothesis, tracking the results, and refining your technique—is at the heart of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout each cycle; each deep inhale should focus your energy and prime your body for the next micro‑movement, while every controlled exhale facilitates smooth, natural transitions between phases. Over time, as you continually track your internal signals—such as the contraction of your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor—and align these with your partner’s feedback, you’ll eventually reach a state of flow. In that state, every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle will be executed seamlessly, automatically, and with impeccable precision. When you achieve flow, your Bata Coxa Stroke will become a continuous, rhythmic expression of scientifically optimized, cumulative stimulation.
Remember, brother, that every small adjustment is crucial. Your lean, ectomorphic structure and balanced extension allow you to deliver intensely focused stimulation—but only if every micro‑movement is executed with consistency and precision. With persistent tracking, meticulous adjustments, and continual refinement, your stroke will evolve into a naturally flowing performance that delivers the perfect balance of cumulative pleasure and intimate precision.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to create your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen designed to reinforce every element of the Bata Coxa Stroke while also building the core strength and overall stability essential for your lean ectomorphic build and a penis size between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your detailed blueprint for turning your natural athleticism into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically calibrated stimulation.
First, establish your own dedicated training space—a quiet, private area where you can focus solely on mastering your technique without distractions. Each training session should begin with an extensive warm‑up tailored to your ectomorphic physique. Engage in dynamic stretches targeting your core, hips, and lower back—these are the key areas that provide the foundation for every precise micro‑movement in the Bata Coxa Stroke. Visualize each stretch as awakening your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the intricate work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for the session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target each component of the stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees firmly planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis size between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface before returning smoothly to center. Synchronize each lateral movement with deep, deliberate breathing—inhaling deeply before initiating the shift, and exhaling slowly as you complete each tap. To further enhance precision and control, incorporate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor with every lateral movement. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke is completely ingrained in your muscle memory.
After you’ve refined the lateral tap, integrate it with the vertical components. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and then a smooth, gradual backward shuttle—making sure that every micro‑movement strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition flows seamlessly. To further bolster your stability and precision, supplement your stroke‑specific drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises, such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills. A strong core is critical not only for maintaining balance but also for ensuring that every movement of the Bata Coxa Stroke is executed with optimal control. Keep a detailed training journal to record every session, noting the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you experiment with, and your partner’s feedback. This journal is an indispensable tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to track your progress and continuously refine your performance.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural ectomorphic agility and balanced extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically optimized, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance while troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of your diligent practice, where your lean, athletic ectomorphic build and a penis size between 5 and 7 inches come together in a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, your core engaged, and your mind entirely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your penis consistently caresses her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward drive must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle—about 80% of your force should target the shallow, nerve‑rich zone, while the remaining force is delicately balanced to engage the mid‑depth and deep areas.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your right hip. Raise your hip in a small, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps. With each tap, focus intently on the pressure: the hilt of your penis must apply targeted, consistent force against the left side of her vaginal opening, while the inner surface of your penis produces a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. If any lateral tap appears inconsistent—whether due to uneven pressure or a slightly off lateral angle—pause and isolate that movement, then drill it repeatedly until both your internal feedback and your partner’s subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced in line with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, pay close attention to the contraction in your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor, and listen closely for any subtle verbal or nonverbal cues from your partner. This troubleshooting moment is essential; it’s when you make minor adjustments—perhaps a slight tweak in your lateral angle or a small change in the pace of your forward push—to further optimize your cumulative stimulation. Use the iterative cycle of the Sexual Scientific Process: define your goal for that cycle, form a hypothesis about a small improvement, meticulously track the outcome, and refine your technique until it is honed to perfection.
Once you’re satisfied with your adjustments, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the entire cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation throughout the vaginal canal. Achieving a state of flow—where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate aim of your training. When you reach that state, your Bata Coxa Stroke will stand as a testament to your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate sensitivity—a seamless, fluid performance that is scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated practice into an art form—a performance where every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and intimate, balanced stimulation. Your athletic mesomorph strength and balanced extension have now been honed into a continuous, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure with each move. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Bata Coxa Stroke bring you closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
