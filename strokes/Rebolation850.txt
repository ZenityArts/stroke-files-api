Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Rebloation Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and it’s a privilege to work with you on this program designed especially for endomorphs with an extension between 5 and 7 inches. Your build is power personified—a robust, full‑figured frame that delivers unmatched strength, stability, and endurance. While your asset is of moderate length, every inch is incredibly sensitive, and when applied with the precise technique we’re about to develop, your natural force is transformed into cumulative, targeted stimulation that turns raw power into intimate mastery.
Picture yourself in your personal training space—a quiet, dedicated sanctuary where every distraction falls away, leaving you with nothing but your focus. Feel the solid, supportive ground under your feet; it mirrors the unwavering stability of your endomorphic build. Take several deep, centered breaths—inhale energy, exhale tension—and imagine that every breath refines your focus, sharpening your readiness to transform your inherent strength into a sophisticated Rebloation Stroke.
We begin by adapting the classic missionary position to suit your powerful frame. Start in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface that can handle your substantial mass. This is your anchor, brother; it locks your body into position so that every micro‑movement—from the controlled twist of your hips to the eventual lateral shift—is executed with deliberate precision. Your natural heaviness and endurance mean that you generate significant force, so it’s crucial to channel that force with control. Your objective is to deliver every bit of your power exactly where it’s most effective—stimulation must be targeted precisely, not bludgeoned indiscriminately.
Once you’re secure, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Think of this insertion as your blueprint—it sets the specific alignment, the precise pressure points, and the necessary angle that will govern the entire Rebloation Stroke. Your journey then unfolds in three distinct phases: first, you launch into a smooth, deliberate forward push; next, you perform a series of hip rotations; and finally, you finish with a lateral shift to complete the pattern. For the Rebloation Stroke, you’ll execute four individual hip rotations to the right, then four individual hip rotations to the left, and ultimately, an additional lateral shift to the left. With each individual hip rotation, the hilt of your penis applies a measured pressure as it “canvasses” a particular segment of your partner’s vaginal opening—first from the north‑eastern down to the south‑eastern segment on your right rotations, and then from the north‑western down to the south‑western segment on your left rotations—while the head of your penis alters its angle gradually, ensuring every rotation builds stimulation cumulatively.
Because you are an endomorph with a moderate extension, precision is your mantra. You must focus about 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), with the remaining 20% evenly spread between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This ensures that your naturally high force does not overwhelm delicate tissues but instead builds a cumulative, layered experience of stimulation.
This introduction lays the groundwork for everything you will learn, brother. Here, you’ve set your stage, aligned your posture, and established the blueprint for turning your raw strength and robust body into a finely choreographed performance. Today marks your first step toward transforming your natural power into a true work of intimate art.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, and Flow
Alright, brother, let’s break down the core principles that underpin your Rebloation Stroke. It’s essential that you grasp these elements so you can train effectively and achieve cumulative, balanced stimulation every time you perform the stroke.
Imagine the 80‑10‑10 principle as your force‑distribution blueprint. The concept is straightforward: approximately 80% of the force you apply should be focused on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because this is where the highest concentration of nerve endings exists and where sensitivity is most potent. The remaining 20% of your force is divided equally so that 10% is directed to the mid‑depth zone (roughly 3 to 5 inches) and the other 10% to the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, an endomorph with a compact extension, this means that while you can generate a tremendous amount of force due to your robust build, the majority of that force must be targeted at the ultra‑sensitive shallow area. This careful allocation prevents overwhelming any single area and builds cumulative stimulation gradually with each repetition.
Next, the Sexual Scientific Process provides a structured, data-driven approach to refining your technique. This process begins by clearly defining your goal—such as maximizing the cumulative impact of each hip rotation during the Rebloation Stroke. Once your goal is set, you form a hypothesis: you might suspect that a slightly slower, more deliberate rotation will enhance pressure distribution, or that a specific change in your hip angle will amplify the cumulative effect. Following this, you enter the tracking phase, where you perform around 30 repetitions for each movement—each rotation, each forward push—and you pay careful attention to both your body’s cues (engaging your core, using your strong pelvic floor) and, importantly, your partner’s responses. Listen for her deep, rhythmic breathing, notice any subtle adjustments in her posture, and capture her soft verbal feedback. This immediate, real-time data allows you to adjust your technique, ensuring that every move is optimized for cumulative, targeted stimulation.
Once you have gathered sufficient data through tracking, you transition into a state of flow. Flow is that almost indescribable state where every micro‑movement—from your smooth forward push to each precise hip rotation—occurs seamlessly without conscious effort. When in flow, your body naturally executes every component with the exact pressure and timing that your tracking helped you fine-tune, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly as your movements become a perfectly choreographed sequence.
In the Rebloation Stroke, unlike some other strokes that might rely on separate drills, the key “keystrokes” are the individual hip rotations and the final lateral shift. By isolating these movements and practicing them repeatedly until they become second nature, you develop the muscle memory and precision needed to deliver cumulative stimulation consistently.
To sum it up, brother: the 80‑10‑10 principle is your guiding blueprint for force distribution, ensuring that 80% of your force is applied to the sensitive shallow zone, and 10% each is targeted to the mid‑depth and deep zones; the Sexual Scientific Process—through goal setting, hypothesis formulation, tracking, and entering flow—provides a systematic approach to refine your technique continuously; and drilling the individual hip rotations and lateral shifts embeds the necessary precision into your performance. With these core principles firmly established, you’re prepared to break down and master the Rebloation Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Rebloation Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s deconstruct the Rebloation Stroke step by step, breaking it down into its key elements to provide you with a precise roadmap for turning your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension into cumulative, targeted stimulation. The Rebloation Stroke is performed in the classic missionary position—you’re on top in a modified plank with your knees planted on the canvas, and your penis is inserted at a controlled, downward diagonal angle. Once inserted, the stroke unfolds in a distinct, sequential pattern. First, you perform four individual hip rotations to the right; next, you complete four individual hip rotations to the left; and finally, you finish with a lateral shift to the left.
Let’s start with the forward push, the foundation of your stroke. From your securely anchored position, push your entire body slowly and deliberately forward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head maintains a continuous, targeted contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is below 5 inches, the 80‑10‑10 principle dictates that around 80% of your applied force is directed to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining 20% is divided equally between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This deliberate forward push creates the cumulative base upon which all the subsequent rotational movements build.
Now, we move into the first phase: four individual hip rotations to the right. As you initiate each rotation to the right, focus on how the hilt of your penis applies steady, focused pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment down through the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. At the same time, observe how the head of your penis adapts—initially directing pressure toward the southwestern wall and then gradually shifting to the north‑western wall with each rotation. Each rotation is a precise keystroke that adds a layer of stimulation, cumulatively building up the overall effect.
After completing the right rotations, you then transition into the second phase: four individual hip rotations to the left. Here, mirror the process. As you rotate to the left, the hilt now canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head first directs its force toward the southeastern wall before transitioning to the north‑eastern wall. This alternating pattern of right and left rotations creates a rhythmic, cumulative stimulation that engages her entire vaginal canal evenly.
Finally, the stroke is completed with a lateral shift to the left. This concluding movement further rounds out the cycle, ensuring that any areas not fully engaged by the rotations receive additional cumulative stimulation.
Throughout this entire sequence, every movement adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is focused on the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone, with the remaining 20% providing a balanced stimulation to the deeper layers. This detailed, step-by-step breakdown transforms your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension into a finely choreographed performance designed to deliver cumulative, precise stimulation with every rotation and shift.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now let’s focus on drilling each individual component of the Rebloation Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with flawless precision. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, you’re built for rapid, precise actions—but every hip rotation must be controlled with exacting detail. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and repeat it until it’s fully ingrained in your muscle memory, always keeping the 80‑10‑10 principle as your guide.
Begin with the forward push drill. In your modified missionary position, with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that complements your lean build, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Slowly execute a forward push toward your partner’s head, focusing on the sensation—feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is compact, allocate about 80% of your force to the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. Repeat this forward push slowly and methodically until the movement becomes smooth, steady, and completely automatic.
Next, isolate the hip rotation drills. Start with a single rotation to the right. From your anchored position, initiate one deliberate hip rotation to the right. As you rotate, concentrate on the hilt of your penis applying steady pressure—feel it canvassing from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, note how the head first directs pressure toward the southwestern wall before shifting to the north‑western wall. Perform one complete rotation slowly, pause, and repeat for at least 30 repetitions until you develop the necessary muscle memory. Then, switch to drilling a single rotation to the left. As you rotate left, feel the hilt canvas smoothly from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head gradually shifts from initially pointing toward the southeastern wall to moving toward the north‑eastern wall. Alternate these rotations until you can execute them seamlessly, with every move strictly following the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
After you’ve refined the individual hip rotations, move on to the lateral shift drill. Slowly shift your entire body laterally to the left, ensuring that the movement is controlled and that the force distribution remains consistent with the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this lateral shift repeatedly until it becomes as natural and automatic as the individual rotations.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing. Each deep inhale provides the energy for the next movement, while every measured exhale ensures a smooth transition between drills. By rigorously repeating the keystrokes—the forward push, the right and left hip rotations, and the lateral shift—you build the muscle memory and precision essential to delivering flawless cumulative stimulation with your Rebloation Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to bring together all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Rebloation Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance with your knees planted firmly on the canvas, your core engaged, and your focus completely on linking every micro‑movement into an uninterrupted, rhythmic cycle. In this integrated sequence, you’ll combine your deliberate forward push with the series of four hip rotations to the right, then four hip rotations to the left, and finally finish with one lateral shift to the left.
Begin with the forward push. From your secure, anchored position, insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push lays the essential foundation by ensuring that about 80% of your force is directed to the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone, as established by the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Immediately after the forward push, initiate the first phase of the stroke—perform four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation to the right, focus on the hilt steadily canvassing from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head transitions from pointing toward the southwestern wall to shifting toward the north‑western wall. Each repetition adds a layer of cumulative stimulation.
Once you’ve completed the right rotations, transition seamlessly to four individual hip rotations to the left. As you rotate left, ensure that the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and that the head shifts from initially directing pressure toward the southeastern wall to ultimately moving toward the north‑eastern wall. This alternating, rhythmic pattern ensures that cumulative stimulation is delivered evenly across her vaginal canal.
Finally, complete the sequence with one controlled lateral shift to the left. This final movement enhances the cumulative effect by ensuring that any areas that might have been missed during the rotations receive their share of stimulation. Every component of your sequence—forward push, hip rotations, and lateral shift—must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that 80% of your force targets the shallow, sensitive zone while the rest is evenly distributed between deeper areas.
Throughout the integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each inhale primes your next move, and each controlled exhale smooths the transitions. With every complete cycle, your Rebloation Stroke evolves into a seamless, continuous performance that transforms your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension into a finely choreographed display of cumulative, targeted stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase—where every micro‑movement of your Rebloation Stroke is refined until your performance becomes a flawlessly executed masterpiece. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, every detail counts, especially during each hip rotation. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains your guiding star: about 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining force is evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you execute your integrated sequence, pay attention to the quality and consistency of every move. During your forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your compact extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When performing your four right and four left hip rotations, observe how the hilt canvasses the vaginal opening and how the head transitions its pressure from one wall to the opposite wall. This is where tracking becomes crucial—each repetition offers immediate, real‑time feedback. Listen to her deep, rhythmic breathing, observe any subtle changes in her posture, and catch any soft verbal cues indicating which elements of your stroke are most effective in building cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your feedback loop, allowing you to fine‑tune your technique by making small adjustments in speed, angle, or force.
Once you have gathered enough tracking data—ideally around 30 repetitions for each phase—you naturally slip into a state of flow. Flow is that nearly magical state where every micro‑movement—from your smooth forward push to each precisely executed hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically in perfect harmony. In flow, your body delivers exactly the pressure and timing that tracking has helped you optimize, allowing cumulative stimulation to build effortlessly with every cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is essential during this phase; every deep inhale primes you for the next move, and every controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions. And if any movement seems slightly off, pause, re-track her feedback, and adjust until every detail is perfected.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, it’s time to craft your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined program designed to reinforce every aspect of your Rebloation Stroke while building your core and overall stability. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, your quickness and precision are your greatest assets, and this routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that delivers cumulative, targeted stimulation every time.
Begin by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions vanish, and your sole focus is on perfecting your technique. Every training session should start with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your ectomorphic body. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these critical muscle groups form the foundation of your stability, ensuring every movement is executed with precise accuracy. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, priming your muscles for the rapid drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a determined, positive tone for your session.
Next, move into your specialized drills, beginning with the forward push. In your modified missionary position, carefully insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle, and practice a smooth, deliberate forward push toward your partner’s head. Since your extension is compact, concentrate around 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone. Once you’ve mastered that, isolate the individual hip rotations. Begin with the right rotations—practice each rotation slowly and deliberately until the hilt consistently canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, while the head shifts accurately from the southwestern to the north‑western wall. Perform at least 30 repetitions until the movement becomes ingrained. Then, mirror the process with left hip rotations until you can execute them seamlessly. Finally, drill the concluding lateral shift that rounds out the stroke. Alternate these drills until every keystroke of your Rebloation Stroke is second nature.
Throughout your practice, maintain deep, controlled breathing to facilitate smooth transitions and precise movements. Supplement your drills with core-strengthening exercises like planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability workouts—your core is the anchor that ensures every rapid action is executed with maximum control. Lastly, keep a detailed training journal where you log each session, record the number of repetitions, document any adjustments, and capture her feedback. This journal is an essential tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, allowing you to track progress and continually refine your technique until perfection is achieved.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—the pinnacle of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Rebloation Stroke merges into one continuous, seamless performance. In this final module, your lean, agile ectomorphic build and compact extension come together in a rhythmic display of cumulative mastery that is both scientifically refined and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position in your modified missionary stance—with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core fully engaged, and your mind dialed into perfection. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, intentional contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that about 80% of your force is dedicated to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone, while the remaining force is carefully balanced to stimulate the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately following the forward push, transition into the hip rotation phase by executing four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation, concentrate on the hilt of your penis applying consistent pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, while the head shifts—first directing its force toward the southwestern wall and then transitioning to the north‑western wall. Next, transition seamlessly into four individual rotations to the left—mirroring the process, with the hilt canvassing from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and the head shifting from initially pointing to the southeastern wall to ultimately moving toward the north‑eastern wall. Finally, complete your cycle with one deliberate lateral shift to the left, ensuring that cumulative stimulation is evenly distributed across her vaginal canal. Throughout the entire sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale fuels your subsequent precise move, and every controlled exhale smooths the transitions between movements.
If any component feels off—for instance, if a rotation lacks precision or the pressure isn’t perfectly balanced—pause, re-track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until every micro‑movement is flawless. The ultimate goal here is to reach a state of natural flow, where every forward push, every hip rotation, and every lateral shift occurs automatically with impeccable precision and cumulative intensity. Once you’re in flow, your Rebloation Stroke will evolve into a seamless, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers the targeted, cumulative stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your dedicated practice into a true work of intimate art—an achievement where every forward push, every individual hip rotation, and every lateral shift is executed with cumulative precision and balanced intensity. Your lean, agile ectomorphic build and compact extension will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Rebloation Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure every time. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Rebloation Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
