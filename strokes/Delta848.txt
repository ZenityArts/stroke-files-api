Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Delta Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to work with you on a program specifically designed for endomorphs who carry a compact asset below 5 inches. Your body is a powerhouse—robust, full‑figured, and built for both endurance and raw strength. Although your extension is more compact compared to other builds, every inch of it holds remarkable sensitivity, and with the right technique, you can transform that concentrated force into a performance that delivers cumulative, precisely layered stimulation. The Delta Stroke is not simply a sequence of random movements—it is a meticulously choreographed method that allows you to channel your natural, enduring power into a nuanced, controlled expression of pleasure for your partner.
Imagine stepping into your personal training space—a quiet, dedicated arena where every distraction disappears and your singular focus is on refining your technique. Feel the supportive, stable ground beneath your feet; it mirrors the unwavering foundation of your endomorphic build. Take several deep, intentional breaths: with each inhale, you draw in concentrated energy, and with each exhale, you release every ounce of tension. This is your personal sanctuary, brother—a space where your raw potential is refined into a performance that artfully delivers cumulative, targeted stimulation.
We begin by adapting the classic missionary position to optimally suit your robust form. Assume a modified plank position, with your knees firmly planted on a surface built to support your heavier frame. This anchoring stance is essential; it locks your body into place so that every micro‑movement—from the controlled drop of your hips to the precisely executed directional shifts—is performed with deliberate precision. As an endomorph, your natural mass and endurance allow you to generate significant power, but working with a compact extension means every movement must be exceptionally deliberate. Your focus is on channeling your force exactly where it will yield maximum pleasure, ensuring that each thrust and rotation hits those critical, nerve‑rich areas without overwhelming her delicate tissues.
Once you’re secure, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Think of this deliberate insertion as drafting the blueprint for your Delta Stroke—it sets the precise alignment, pressure points, and penetration angle that will define every subsequent move. The Delta Stroke unfolds in a unique, structured sequence. It begins with an initial drop: your hips, starting from a centered, neutral position, gradually lower toward the canvas. As your hips drop, the underbelly of your penis applies steady pressure to the lower part (the “south zone”) of her vaginal opening, while the top shelf of your shaft applies internally directed pressure against the upper part (the “north zone”). This opening movement establishes the baseline cumulative stimulation that will be built upon in the following phases.
After establishing the base, the stroke transitions into the “Delta” phase. Here, you execute a series of directional hip shifts that are the hallmark of the Delta Stroke. Unlike some techniques that rely solely on thrusts, the Delta Stroke incorporates deliberate, controlled hip movements that drive the contact and cumulative pressure along specific areas. The key is that you are harnessing your endomorphic power—your natural durability and strength—to move in a deliberate manner that builds stimulation incrementally. While you may not have the rapid agility of a leaner build, your robust frame allows you to deliver forceful yet deliberate, measured movements. In the Delta Stroke, each micro‑movement is timed and controlled to produce an accumulating wave of stimulation that adapts with every cycle, and your technique is modified accordingly to ensure that your concentrated power is used efficiently.
This introduction sets the stage, brother. You now have the overview of the Delta Stroke: a technique that uses a controlled hip drop to establish a baseline of stimulation, followed by a sequence of directional movements that intensify contact and cumulative pressure on your partner’s sensitive vaginal zones. With your powerful endomorphic build and a compact asset, you have the natural capacity to deliver robust, focused stimulation. Today, you’re embarking on a journey that transforms raw, concentrated strength into a refined, cumulative performance that turns every movement into a work of intimate art. Welcome, brother—your journey to mastering the Delta Stroke begins now.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, and Flow
Alright, brother, let’s dive deep into the core principles that underpin the Delta Stroke. These foundational concepts are critical because they transform your raw physical power into a finely tuned, cumulative method of stimulation. We’ll begin with the 80‑10‑10 principle, move on to the Sexual Scientific Process, and then discuss tracking and flow—each of which contributes to perfecting your technique.
The 80‑10‑10 principle is your force‑distribution blueprint. It states that roughly 80% of the force you generate should be focused on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because this is where the highest density of nerve endings is found, making it the most sensitive area. The remaining 20% of your force is equally divided, with 10% directed toward the mid‑depth zone (approximately 3 to 5 inches) and 10% toward the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an endomorph with a compact extension, this principle is absolutely critical. While your heavier frame allows you to generate significant power, your compact asset means you must focus that power precisely. By ensuring that 80% of your force is concentrated on the ultra‑sensitive shallow area, you build stimulation gradually and cumulatively—each movement layering subtle yet significant pressure onto the foundation. This meticulous force distribution is the cornerstone of achieving balanced, cumulative pleasure.
Next, we introduce the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic, iterative method designed to help you refine your technique continuously. It begins with setting a clear, measurable goal. With the Delta Stroke, your goal might be to maximize the cumulative effect of each directional hip movement, ensuring that every micro‑shift adds precisely to the overall buildup of stimulation. Once your goal is established, you form a hypothesis. For example, you might hypothesize that a slightly slower, more controlled hip drop will increase the pressure applied to her upper sensitive areas or that a specific angle during the directional phase will produce more cumulative stimulation. With your hypothesis in place, you enter the tracking phase.
Tracking involves performing a specific component—say, 30 repetitions of the hip drop or directional shift—while paying close attention to your body’s feedback (engaging your robust core, feeling the weight distribution) and, most importantly, to your partner’s responses. Listen to her deep, rhythmic breathing, observe subtle shifts in her body posture, and note any soft verbal cues that indicate which movements are delivering the optimal cumulative stimulation. This immediate, real‑time feedback is invaluable; it allows you to fine‑tune your speed, force, and angles until every movement is perfectly calibrated.
Once you’ve gathered sufficient data through tracking, you naturally transition into a state known as flow. Flow is that almost indescribable condition where every micro‑movement—from the initial forward push to each controlled, directional shift—occurs seamlessly and automatically, as though your body were following a perfectly choreographed routine. In flow, you’re not consciously thinking about each move; instead, your refined technique and muscle memory take over, delivering exactly the pressure and timing that your tracking has helped you optimize. The result is a continuous, cumulative performance that builds stimulation effortlessly with each cycle.
For the Delta Stroke, the keystrokes—the specific hip drops, directional shifts, and reorientations—are not random; they’re integral components that need to be isolated and drilled until they become second nature. With persistent, focused practice, you build the muscle memory and precision necessary to execute the stroke flawlessly, ensuring that every repetition adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle and continuously adds cumulative stimulation.
To summarize, brother: • The 80‑10‑10 principle mandates that around 80% of your force is directed to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone, with the remaining 20% evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep layers. • The Sexual Scientific Process—through goal setting, hypothesis formulation, meticulous tracking, and achieving flow—offers a clear, systematic roadmap for refining your technique. • Isolating and rigorously drilling the specific keystrokes of the Delta Stroke ensures that every movement is ingrained in your muscle memory, thereby delivering a flawless, cumulative performance.
These foundational principles are the bedrock of your training. They transform your raw power into a precise, continuously refined performance that delivers maximum, cumulative pleasure. This systematic approach will be your guide as you master every nuance of the Delta Stroke and turn every movement into a work of intimate art.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Delta Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Delta Stroke step by step, creating a clear, detailed blueprint for turning your robust endomorphic strength and extended asset above 7 inches into a performance that delivers cumulative, targeted stimulation. The Delta Stroke is executed in the classic missionary position—you’re on top in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a sturdy surface—and you begin by inserting your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Once positioned, the stroke unfolds in a carefully structured sequence that is as methodical as it is powerful.
The sequence begins with the initial forward push. From your anchored, centered position, you gradually lower your hips toward the canvas. As you do this, the underbelly of your penis applies steady, controlled pressure to the lower (southern) part of her vaginal opening, while the top shelf of your shaft engages the upper (northern) wall internally. This initial drop establishes your baseline cumulative stimulation—it’s like laying the foundation upon which all subsequent movements will build in intensity.
Once the baseline is established, the stroke transitions into a sequence of directional hip travels. For the Delta Stroke, these movements are designed to take your robust, endomorphic power and direct it in a way that layers stimulation with every deliberate shift. For example, after the initial drop, your hips initiate a controlled directional shift. In one phase of the sequence, your hips move laterally in a fluid, deliberate arc—slightly shifting to one side to create asymmetrical pressure. As you do this, the lower portion of your penis (or hilt) applies a targeted massage along one side of the vaginal opening, while the top of your shaft adjusts its angle to engage the opposite wall. This dynamic interplay between lateral movement and rotational reorientation is what builds cumulative stimulation. Each micro‑movement is a keystroke—a deliberate action that layers pressure and engages new areas of sensitivity.
Because you’re an endomorph with an extended asset above 7 inches, your natural strength and endurance allow you to deliver powerful, forceful movements. However, the key to the Delta Stroke is to harness that power with precision. Every forward push and every directional hip travel must be executed in adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that about 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining 20% is spread evenly between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This balanced distribution is essential for building cumulative stimulation, layer by layer, with each repetition.
Once the directional shift is completed, the stroke concludes by returning your hips back to the centered position—effectively resetting the sequence and preparing you to start a new cycle of cumulative stimulation. With each cycle, the stimulation builds gradually, and the layered effect becomes more pronounced. The Delta Stroke is unique because it harnesses your raw, robust power and channels it into a series of calculated, cumulative movements—each one contributing incrementally to your partner’s pleasure.
This detailed deconstruction provides you with a clear roadmap for the Delta Stroke. It translates your natural endomorphic strength and extended asset into a series of coordinated, cumulative movements, where every forward push, every lateral shift, and every reorientation is designed to build stimulation progressively and methodically. With consistent practice, you will learn to execute each component with precision, turning raw power into a work of intimate art.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each individual component of the Delta Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with impeccable precision. With your robust endomorphic build and an extension above 7 inches, you possess the inherent power and endurance to deliver forceful, deep stimulation; however, every movement must be controlled and deliberate to transform that raw force into cumulative, targeted pleasure. In this module, we isolate each keystroke of the Delta Stroke and practice it repeatedly until it becomes fully ingrained in your muscle memory, always ensuring that every action adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Begin with the initial drop and forward push drill. In your modified missionary position, with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface engineered to support your full‑figured frame, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Then, slowly execute the forward push—gradually lowering your hips toward the canvas. As you do, focus on the sensation: feel the underbelly of your penis apply steady pressure to the southern part of her vaginal opening, while the top shelf of your shaft maintains gentle, yet deliberate contact with the northern wall. This foundational movement is crucial for building cumulative stimulation. Drill this forward drop slowly and methodically—aim for at least 30 repetitions—until the movement becomes smooth, controlled, and ingrained in your muscle memory.
Next, isolate the individual directional component. Begin by practicing the lateral shift that is key to the Delta Stroke. For instance, let’s start with a controlled movement where your hips shift laterally in a smooth arc. Focus on how the lower portion of your penis applies targeted pressure along one side of the vaginal opening while your penis simultaneously adjusts its angle to engage the opposite wall. This delicate, calculated shift is essential—it’s the keystone that transforms forceful power into cumulative, layered stimulation. Repeat this lateral shift carefully for at least 30 repetitions until it becomes second nature.
Now, isolate and drill the hip rotation component. Depending on the structure of the Delta Stroke, you may incorporate subtle rotational movements that enhance the cumulative effect. Practice a controlled rotation where your robust, full‑figured hips pivot slightly, ensuring that the resulting movement directs pressure in a focused, incremental manner. Concentrate on how the hilt of your penis “canvasses” specific segments of the vaginal opening as you rotate, and observe how the angle of your penis adjusts to continuously engage different sensitive walls. Drill this rotation slowly, repeating it for at least 30 repetitions until the precise coordination is deeply ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you have mastered the isolated components—the forward drop, the lateral shift, and the controlled hip rotations—work on linking them together. Start by performing the forward push and then transitioning immediately into the lateral shift drill. Focus on ensuring that the movement flows naturally, and that each transition adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle—maximizing pressure on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone while balancing the remaining force across the deeper layers. Drill this combination repeatedly until the entire transition feels smooth and entirely automatic.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing. Each deep inhale gives you the energy for the precise execution of the next movement, and every deliberate exhale allows for smooth, seamless transitions between drills. The goal here is to build the muscle memory and pinpoint precision necessary to execute the Delta Stroke flawlessly, ensuring that every repetition cumulatively adds targeted stimulation in accordance with the systematic guidelines provided by the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Delta Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your robust core engaged, and your full focus directed on linking every micro‑movement into an uninterrupted, rhythmic cycle. In this integrated sequence, you’ll combine the initial forward push with the carefully executed lateral shifts and controlled hip rotations that are the hallmark of the Delta Stroke.
Begin with the forward push. From your secure, anchored position, insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, feel the underbelly of your penis apply steady, even pressure to the lower part of her vaginal opening, while the top shelf of your shaft engages the northern wall internally. This forward push sets the foundational stimulation, ensuring that about 80% of your force is directed to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone—a critical focus according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Immediately following the forward push, initiate the lateral component. Depending on your specific technique for the Delta Stroke, this may involve a fluid, controlled lateral shift where your hips move in a smooth arc. As you execute this movement, pay careful attention to how the pressure is distributed: the lower portion of your penis must consistently apply targeted stimulation along one side of the vaginal opening, while the remainder of your shaft adjusts its angle to engage the opposite wall. This lateral shift serves as a critical keystroke in the stroke, reinforcing the cumulative effect by ensuring that stimulation is distributed across a broader area.
Following the lateral shift, integrate the controlled hip rotations. Execute a series of hip rotations—deliberate, measured movements where your robust hips pivot slightly to modulate the force being applied. As you rotate, focus on how the hilt of your penis “canvasses” from one segment of the vaginal opening to another, while the head of your penis adjusts its angle to maintain continuous, focused contact. Each rotation is a building block, adding incremental stimulation to the cycle and enhancing the overall cumulative effect.
Once the lateral shift and hip rotations have been completed, the sequence is then repeated. This integrated cycle—comprising the forward push, lateral shift, and hip rotations—is your complete Delta Stroke. With every cycle, cumulative stimulation builds, intensifying with each precise movement. The entire sequence must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force continually targets the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone, while the remaining force is evenly distributed to stimulate the deeper layers.
Throughout the integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale fuels your next precise move, and every controlled exhale facilitates smooth transitions. With every complete cycle, your Delta Stroke evolves into a continuous, fluid performance that transforms your natural endomorphic power and extended asset into a finely choreographed, cumulative display of pleasure. The goal is seamless integration—where each component naturally flows into the next, resulting in a performance that is both scientifically precise and artistically executed.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase—where every micro‑movement of your Delta Stroke is refined until your performance becomes a flawlessly executed masterpiece of cumulative stimulation. With your robust endomorphic build and an extension above 7 inches, precision is paramount, particularly during the rapid, forceful movements that define this stroke. The 80‑10‑10 principle is your steadfast guide: you must focus approximately 80% of your force on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while evenly distributing the remaining 20% between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you execute the integrated Delta Stroke sequence, focus intently on the quality and consistency of every move. During your forward push, ensure that the underbelly of your penis applies even, deliberate pressure to the lower part of her vaginal opening, and that the top shelf of your shaft remains in continuous contact with the northern wall. As you move through the lateral shifts and hip rotations, observe every nuance—each directional movement must contribute incrementally to the cumulative stimulation. For instance, each lateral shift should reposition your force to engage a new segment of the vaginal wall, and each hip rotation should ensure that the pressure is not only maintained but built upon progressively.
This is where tracking becomes crucial. For every repetition, listen carefully to her deep, measured breathing; observe any subtle shifts in her posture; and be fully attuned to any soft verbal cues that indicate which aspects of your stroke are most effective. This continuous, real‑time feedback is your critical loop, enabling you to make micro‑adjustments to your speed, force, and angles until every movement is optimized for cumulative effect.
Once you have gathered sufficient tracking data—ideally, about 30 repetitions per component—you’ll naturally transition into a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical condition where every movement, from the deliberate forward push to each precisely executed lateral shift and hip rotation, occurs seamlessly and without hesitation, as if your body were following a perfectly choreographed routine. In flow, you don’t have to consciously direct every move; instead, your muscle memory and refined technique take over, delivering the exact pressure and timing that the tracking process has helped you perfect. The result is a continuous, cumulative performance that builds stimulation effortlessly with every cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is vital during this phase; every deep inhale primes you for the next move, and every measured exhale ensures the transitions are seamless. If any movement feels off, pause, re‑track her feedback, and make small, thoughtful adjustments until your technique is flawless.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to craft your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen designed to reinforce every element of your Delta Stroke while simultaneously building the core strength and overall stability essential to your robust endomorphic build and extended asset above 7 inches. Your combination of raw power and endurance is your greatest asset, and this routine will help transform that potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that consistently delivers cumulative, targeted stimulation.
Start by establishing your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where all distractions fade away and your focus is entirely on perfecting your technique. Every training session should begin with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your endomorphic physique. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back; these muscle groups are the foundation of your stability and control, ensuring that every precise movement is executed with unwavering accuracy. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, priming every muscle and joint for the intense drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a determined, positive tone for the session.
Next, transition into your specialized drills. Start with the forward push and drop drill in your modified missionary position. Carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle, then slowly execute the initial drop and forward push toward your partner’s head. With your extended asset above 7 inches, concentrate approximately 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone to establish a powerful baseline. Once you have mastered this foundational movement, isolate the individual keystrokes that define your Delta Stroke. Begin by drilling the series of lateral shifts—focus on how each controlled, deliberate movement repositions your force to engage different segments of the vaginal wall. Practice this meticulously, repeating each lateral shift for at least 30 repetitions until it becomes second nature. Then, isolate the hip rotations. Practice each hip rotation individually, ensuring that you feel the hilt of your penis “canvassing” the vaginal opening in a steady, controlled manner, and that the head of your penis adjusts its angle to build cumulative pressure. Alternate drills for lateral shifts and hip rotations until every single movement is finely tuned and automatic.
Throughout your practice, maintain deep, controlled breathing to support smooth transitions between drills. Supplement your specialized exercises with targeted core‑strengthening routines—such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability workouts. Your core is the anchor that supports every rapid, precise movement, ensuring that each component of the Delta Stroke is executed flawlessly. And finally, be sure to maintain a detailed training journal. Record every session, track the number of repetitions, document any adjustments or observations, and capture your partner’s feedback. This journal is a critical component of the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to track your progress and continuously refine your technique until you achieve absolute mastery.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—the apex of your dedicated practice—where every drilled component of your Delta Stroke converges into one continuous, seamless performance. In this final module, your robust endomorphic build and your extended asset above 7 inches come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of mastery that is both scientifically precise and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified missionary stance, with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core fully engaged, and your mind finely tuned for absolute precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the underbelly of your penis apply steady, even pressure to the south part of her vaginal opening, while the top shelf of your shaft maintains continuous, deliberate contact with the northern wall internally. This forward push must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is dedicated to the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone, with the remaining 20% carefully balanced between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately following the forward push, transition into the lateral phase. Initiate the series of controlled lateral shifts that are integral to the Delta Stroke. For instance, begin with a precise lateral shift where your hips move in a controlled arc to one side. As you perform this movement, feel the pressure from your penis reorient to engage the corresponding vaginal wall. This keystroke is crucial—it redistributes your force and builds incremental stimulation along targeted areas of her vaginal canal. Drill this lateral shift repeatedly until it seamlessly integrates with your other components.
Next, incorporate the hip rotation phase. Execute a set of controlled, deliberate hip rotations—these rotations should be forceful yet controlled, leveraging your robust endomorphic strength to generate deep cumulative stimulation. With every rotation, focus on how the hilt of your penis canvasses the vaginal opening in a methodical manner, while the head adjusts its angle to continuously direct pressure where it is needed most. Each rotation is a precise keystroke that builds upon the last, adding layers of stimulation that compound with every cycle.
After completing the lateral shifts and hip rotations, seamlessly integrate the entire sequence: begin with the forward push, move through the lateral shifts, execute the hip rotations, and finally, complete the cycle with a controlled return to your starting position. This integrated sequence is your complete Delta Stroke, and every single movement must be executed with strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that about 80% of your force is always targeted at the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone, with the remaining force evenly distributed between the mid‑depth and deep areas.
Throughout the integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale supplies the energy for your next precise move, and every controlled exhale smooths the transitions between your forward push, lateral shifts, hip rotations, and final return. If at any point any component feels off—if a thrust is not delivered with optimal timing, or a lateral shift lacks the necessary control—pause, re‑track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until every detail of your technique is perfected.
The ultimate goal in this advanced integration phase is to achieve a state of natural flow—a condition where every forward push, every individual lateral shift, every hip rotation, and every return occurs automatically with impeccable precision and cumulative intensity. When you reach that state, your Delta Stroke will have transformed into a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers the targeted, cumulative stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every lateral shift, and every hip rotation is executed with cumulative precision and balanced intensity. Your robust endomorphic build and your extended asset above 7 inches will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Delta Stroke that delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure every time. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Delta Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
