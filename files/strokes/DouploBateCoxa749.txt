Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Bata Coxa Stroke! I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to work with you—a lean, agile ectomorph with a penis between 5 and 7 inches. Your naturally slender, energetic body is built for speed and precision. Although your extension is moderate, every inch is incredibly sensitive, and with the proper technique, you can channel this sensitivity into a series of cumulative, controlled movements. Today, we will translate your natural athleticism into a meticulously choreographed performance that fuses scientific principles with intimate finesse.
Before we start, I want you to find your training sanctuary—a quiet, comfortable space where you can focus without distractions. Sit or lie down, relax your lean shoulders, and take several deep, steady breaths so that your mind becomes clear and receptive. This is your time to learn and internalize every detail of the technique we’re about to explore.
We begin by modifying the classic missionary position to suit your ectomorphic build. Start in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. This foundational posture is essential for you—it anchors your long, slender limbs and allows you to execute every micro‑movement with precision. Once you are in position, you will insert your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This precise insertion sets the blueprint for every subsequent action in the stroke.
The first movement is a smooth forward push where you move your entire body slowly northward toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, notice how the top shelf of your compact extension glides gently over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is between 5 and 7 inches, you must focus most of your energy on the shallow vaginal zone—the area that is most sensitive. We achieve this by adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle, which means roughly 80% of your force is directed at the shallow 1–3 inches, and the remaining 20% is split equally between the mid‑depth and deep areas.
After the forward push, the stroke transitions into its signature lateral phase. Here, you’ll use your ectomorphic agility to execute precise lateral movements with your left hip. In this phase, you gently drop your left hip toward the canvas so that the hilt of your penis applies targeted pressure along the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening. Simultaneously, your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right, creating friction and a gentle rocking massage along her right wall. Then, you raise your left hip back to center to reset the movement before repeating the cycle. In the Douplo variation, after completing the entire left-side sequence, you mirror the exact same motions on the right side—ensuring that stimulation is delivered evenly on both sides of the vaginal canal.
This introduction sets the foundation for transforming your natural ectomorphic agility and moderate extension into a meticulously controlled, scientifically optimized performance. Every forward push, lateral drop-and-raise, and reset is designed to target the sensitive shallow zone while maintaining an overall balanced stimulation. Welcome, brother—let’s start transforming your raw potential into a masterful expression of intimate art with the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re going to delve into the core principles that underpin your technique. Understanding these elements is key to ensuring every movement in the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke is executed with surgical precision and cumulative effectiveness.
The 80‑10‑10 Principle At its heart, the 80‑10‑10 principle is a force distribution guideline. It instructs you to concentrate approximately 80% of your applied force on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches, where nerve endings are densest and most sensitive. The remaining 20% of your force should be divided evenly: 10% to the mid‑depth zone (about 3–5 inches) and 10% to the deep area (beyond 5 inches). For an ectomorph with a moderate extension, this is especially critical because your smaller surface area means precision is vital. Every forward push, lateral drop, and reset must be modulated so that the majority of the stimulation is focused where it yields the maximum pleasure.
The Sexual Scientific Process This process is the systematic approach for refining your stroke. It consists of four steps:
Define Your Goal: Identify precisely what you want to achieve with each cycle—for example, optimal friction along the vaginal wall during your lateral drop.
Form a Hypothesis: Based on initial practice and feedback, predict what slight adjustments might enhance the stimulation—perhaps a different pace in your hip movement.
Track: Methodically perform a high number of strokes (ideally at least 30 repetitions per “wall”) and record data from your internal cues (core engagement, pelvic floor strength) along with your partner’s responses (her breathing patterns, verbal feedback, subtle body movements).
Flow: Once you determine the variation that consistently delivers the best results, commit to that automatic, rhythmic sequence. When you are in flow, every movement connects seamlessly, and the 80‑10‑10 distribution is maintained without conscious effort.
Tracking Tracking is the process of meticulously gathering data from each repetition. As you perform the stroke, pay close attention to how your partner’s body reacts and how your body feels internally. Tracking turns subjective sensations into objective information, which you can use to fine-tune your technique.
Flow Flow is achieved when your movements become instinctive and seamless. It is that state where every forward push, lateral drop, and backward shuttle occurs automatically and with perfect rhythm—without you needing to consciously direct each motion. In flow, your stroke continuously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle, delivering cumulative stimulation in a natural, fluid manner.
The Tap Keystroke The tap keystroke is a fundamental drill for mastering lateral movement. It involves starting in a stable position (such as a forearm plank), shifting laterally until your hip gently “taps” the surface, and then returning smoothly to the center. This controlled, minimal movement builds muscle memory and strengthens your pelvic floor—especially when combined with coordinated breathing and kegeling exercises. Mastery of the tap keystroke is essential for executing the lateral portions of the stroke with precise control, ensuring that the cumulative stimulation is focused exactly where it is needed.
Together, these core elements provide the scientific framework for perfecting the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. They ensure that every micro‑movement is deliberate, every force distribution is balanced, and your technique is continuously refined through feedback. With these principles clearly understood, you’re now ready to deconstruct the stroke into its fundamental components.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into its essential building blocks. This stroke is a dual‑phase variation that first operates on the left side and then mirrors exactly on the right side. As an ectomorph with a penis below 5 inches, every micro‑movement must be executed with precision to maximize cumulative stimulation on a compact, sensitive surface. We’ll start by deconstructing the left‑side sequence, then discuss how to mirror it on the right.
Left‑Side Sequence:
Forward Movement: Begin by inserting your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Then, execute a gentle forward push—moving your entire body steadily northward toward her head. During this movement, the top shelf of your compact penis glides softly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Following the 80‑10‑10 principle, approximately 80% of your force here is focused on the shallow zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), ensuring maximum targeted stimulation while the remaining force is distributed to the mid‑depth and deep zones.
Lateral Phase – Left Hip Drop: After the forward push, initiate the lateral phase on the left side by dropping your left hip in a controlled, deliberate manner toward the canvas. In doing so, the hilt of your penis applies focused pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, your penis reorients so its inner surface points to the right, creating friction and a gentle rocking massage along her right vaginal wall—from the eastern to the northern section. This lateral drop is executed using the tap keystroke: a small, deliberate move that ensures the majority of stimulation remains in the sensitive shallow area.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Left‑Side Reversal): Immediately after the left hip drop, raise your left hip back to center. This reversal is key to integrating the cumulative stimulation: the hilt now shifts its pressure from the western section toward the northern section of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients to point straight north, producing a gentle upward massage from the northern wall to the eastern wall. This controlled raise maintains rhythm and ensures that the force distribution follows the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Cycle Repetition with Variations: Repeat the left‑side sequence several times to build cumulative stimulation. In some cycles, you can vary the pace—such as raising your left hip only halfway toward center at a faster rate to intensify friction, then executing another drop—before finally completing the cycle by fully returning your left hip to center. This variation in pace adds dynamic texture to your performance while ensuring that approximately 80% of your force consistently targets the shallow zone.
Right‑Side Mirrored Sequence: After completing the left‑side sequence, you mirror the exact same sequence on the right side.
Forward Movement: Reset your position with a forward push identical to the left‑side sequence—ensuring that the top shelf again glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant contact with her “south wall.” The 80‑10‑10 force distribution must remain consistent.
Lateral Phase – Right Hip Drop: Initiate the right‑side lateral phase by dropping your right hip in a controlled manner. In this mirror movement, the hilt of your penis applies consistent pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so its inner surface points to the left—producing a gentle rocking massage along her left vaginal wall.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Right‑Side Reversal): Immediately, raise your right hip back to center so that the pressure shifts accordingly—from the eastern section toward the northern section—and your penis reorients to point north, producing upward stimulation from the northern wall toward the western wall.
Cycle Repetition (Right Side): Repeat the right‑side sequence—ensuring that your lateral drops, controlled raises, and pacing variations mirror those performed on the left side—so that both sides of the vaginal canal receive balanced cumulative stimulation.
The complete Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke is achieved when the left‑side sequence is performed in full, immediately followed by the right‑side mirror sequence. This dual‑phase approach delivers intensive, balanced stimulation across both sides, with every movement executed in strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as your breath. With your lean ectomorphic build and a penis below 5 inches, precision and consistency are absolutely critical. In this module, we will focus on repetitive, intensive practice of each segmented phase—starting with the forward push, then isolating the lateral drop using the tap keystroke (first for the left side, then for the right), followed by controlled hip lowering and finishing with the backward shuttle—ensuring that every repetition adheres perfectly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Forward Movement Drill: Begin by assuming your modified plank position with your knees securely planted on a stable surface—this provides the solid support needed for your lean frame. Insert your penis at the precise downward diagonal angle into your partner, and then slowly push your entire body forward toward her head. Concentrate on the sensations as the top shelf of your compact extension glides gently over her clitoral region and the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” With your extension being compact, roughly 80% of your force must target the shallow zone. Drill this forward push slowly and deliberately, repeating the movement several times until you can replicate it smoothly and consistently.
Left‑Side Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): Next, isolate the lateral component on the left. From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a small, controlled lateral shift until it gently taps the supporting surface. Visualize how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle rocking massage on her right wall. Coordinate each lateral tap with deep, controlled breathing: inhale before initiating the drop and exhale slowly as you complete the motion. Incorporate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each tap to build extra precision. Drill this movement repeatedly—aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on the left side until the tap keystroke is completely ingrained.
Right‑Side Lateral Tap Drill (Mirrored Tap Keystroke): After you’ve perfected the left‑side lateral tap, mirror that drill on the right side. From your forward position, carefully drop your right hip in a controlled lateral movement until your right hip taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Visualize the hilt applying steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her left wall. Again, coordinate your movement with deep, deliberate breathing and incorporate kegeling for added precision. Drill for at least 30 repetitions on the right side until that movement becomes second nature.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: Following lateral taps, focus on the lowering phase. After each lateral tap, slowly lower your dropped hip until it gently contacts the supporting surface, allowing the underbelly of your penis to apply cumulative, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf maintains continuous contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle—retract your body in a controlled manner so that your penis remains in constant contact with her north wall as you reset your position without fully withdrawing. Repeat the entire sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times on each side until every micro‑movement flows smoothly and adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout your drilling session, maintain deep, deliberate breathing. Each deep inhale should focus your mind and prime your body for the next precise movement, while each controlled exhale ensures a smooth transition between phases. With consistent, focused practice, your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension will integrate into a series of perfectly executed, cumulative movements that become second nature.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all of the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—that’s when the true art of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke emerges. Return to your starting position in your modified plank, with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your focus solely on creating a fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this module, you’ll merge your forward push, lateral taps (first on the left then mirrored on the right), controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle into one unified, rhythmic cycle that forms the distinctive “W” pattern of the stroke.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the optimal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward—moving steadily north toward your partner’s head. As you do so, ensure that the top shelf of your compact penis glides consistently over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push lays the foundation for cumulative stimulation and must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, focusing about 80% of your force on the shallow zone.
Immediately, transition into the lateral phase. First, execute three controlled lateral taps on the left side by dropping your left hip using the tap keystroke. Focus on the way the hilt applies targeted, steady pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, generating a subtle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right wall. Once these left‑side taps are perfected, gently raise your left hip back to center to reset the pressure. Then, perform a slow, deliberate backward shuttle until you return to your starting position, ensuring that your penis remains in constant contact with her north wall.
Immediately after, mirror the sequence on the right side. From your starting position, perform another forward push (maintaining the same 80‑10‑10 distribution), then execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your right hip until it taps the surface—here, the hilt applies pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, and your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left, creating a gentle rocking massage on her left wall. Then, raise your right hip back to center and execute a smooth backward shuttle to reset.
This alternating, “walking” motion—first left, then right—creates a rhythmic “W” pattern that delivers cumulative stimulation across the entire vaginal canal. Every micro‑movement, each forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle, must consistently adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle for maximum efficacy.
Throughout the integrated routine, let your deep, rhythmic breathing serve as your internal metronome—inhale deeply to prime your body for the next phase, and exhale steadily to ensure seamless transitions. With every complete cycle, your natural ectomorphic precision and compact extension converge into one continuous, fluid performance—a Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke that is both scientifically refined and intimately effective.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our aim is to fine‑tune every micro‑adjustment of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your lean ectomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every movement must be executed with impeccable precision to adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle. This means you must ensure that roughly 80% of your applied force is directed to the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, with the remaining 20% evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep regions.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, observe each detail of your performance closely. During the forward push, confirm that the top shelf of your compact penis glides consistently over her clitoral region and that the head maintains steady, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, when you execute your lateral taps via the tap keystroke, pay close attention to the natural, subtle rocking motion produced by your controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even the slightest variation—such as a one or two degree change in your hip drop angle—can significantly affect the cumulative stimulation. Experiment with these minor adjustments and carefully note how they influence the pressure distribution and rocking effect. Rely on your partner’s feedback—her deep, rhythmic breathing, gentle verbal cues, and even subtle body movements provide critical data points. This iterative process of defining objectives, forming hypotheses, tracking outcomes, and refining your technique is the very heart of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout each cycle. Every deep inhale should focus your energy for the upcoming micro‑movement, and every controlled exhale should facilitate a smooth, natural transition between phases. Over time, as you continuously track your internal sensations (such as core engagement and pelvic floor contractions) in tandem with your partner’s responses, you will reach a state of flow—a seamless, automatic performance where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve this state, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will become a continuous, rhythmic expression of scientifically optimized, cumulative stimulation.
Remember, brother, every tiny adjustment matters. Your lean ectomorphic frame and compact extension provide an ideal foundation for delivering intensely focused stimulation, but only if every micro‑movement is executed with consistency and precision. Keep tracking both your internal cues and your partner’s subtle responses, and continually refine your technique until your stroke evolves into a naturally flowing performance that is both scientifically precise and intimately satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a structured and disciplined training regimen specifically designed to reinforce every element of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke while strengthening your core and overall stability, which are vital for your lean ectomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your detailed roadmap for converting your natural athletic precision into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically calibrated stimulation.
First, establish your dedicated training space—a quiet, private area free from distractions where you can focus solely on perfecting your technique. Each training session should start with an extensive warm‑up tailored to your ectomorphic physique. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back; these are the critical support areas necessary for executing every precise micro‑movement in the stroke. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine and preparing every muscle fiber for the rigorous work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for your session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target each individual component of the stroke. Begin with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees securely planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Focus on raising your right hip just enough to gently tap the surface, then returning smoothly to center. Synchronize each lateral tap with deep, deliberate breathing—inhaling deeply before initiating each movement and exhaling slowly as you complete it. To further enhance precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor with each tap. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke becomes ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve perfected the lateral tap, integrate it with your vertical movements. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps, and then finish with a smooth, gradual backward shuttle. Ensure that every micro‑movement strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle—directing about 80% of your force to the shallow zone while gently engaging the mid‑depth and deep areas. Drill this full integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition flows seamlessly. To further bolster your stability and precision, supplement your stroke-specific drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills. A strong core is critical to maintaining both balance and precision in the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. Finally, keep a detailed training journal where you record every session—the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you test, and your partner’s feedback. This journal is an indispensable part of the Sexual Scientific Process, helping you track progress and continuously refine your technique.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of your disciplined practice, where your lean ectomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, core engaged, and your mind entirely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your penis consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone.
Immediately, transition into the lateral phase on one side by executing the tap keystroke—drop your right or left hip (depending on the side you’re beginning with) in a small, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps. With each tap, focus intently on ensuring that the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along the relevant side of her vaginal opening, and that your penis rotates so its inner surface produces a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the corresponding wall. If any lateral tap appears inconsistent—whether due to uneven pressure or a slight misalignment—pause and isolate that movement. Drill it repeatedly until your internal feedback and your partner’s subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced in line with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Next, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you perform the pushout, focus on the contraction of your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for any subtle verbal or nonverbal cues from your partner. This troubleshooting phase is critical; if you notice that the cumulative stimulation isn’t optimized, make slight adjustments—perhaps a minor tweak in your lateral angle or a subtle variation in the pace of your forward push—and track the outcome meticulously using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as a unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation throughout the entire vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you reach this state, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will stand as a testament to your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate finesse—a continuous, fluid performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated training into an art form—a performance in which every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your athletic mesomorph strength and balanced extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure in every movement. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke bring you ever closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
