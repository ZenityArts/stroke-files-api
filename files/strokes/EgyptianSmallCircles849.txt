Module 1 establishes the foundation for Egyptian Small Circles by building perfect posture, pressure awareness, and breath rhythm from the forearm-plank baseline. Begin by lowering onto your forearms, keeping your elbows directly under your shoulders, wrists relaxed, and palms flat on the canvas. Let your chest hover an inch above her body, never collapsing your weight. Your knees stay grounded and wide enough to stabilize, while your hips hover just above hers. From here, take a long inhale, feeling your abdomen expand downward, and exhale slowly through your mouth to settle your pelvis into alignment. This position is your neutral baseline, the body’s “home key.” Every movement will return to this place before beginning again.
In this baseline, you will notice your pelvis naturally pointing at a downward diagonal toward the south wall of her canal. This direction matters. It’s where the Egyptian Small Circles begins its orbit, tracing warmth through subtle rotation rather than force. Before any movement, feel the contact point: shallow depth, about eighty percent entry, light pressure, soft exhale. As an endomorph, your strength is built-in—your task is restraint. Keep your abdomen firm to stabilize your lower back and prevent over-compression of your hips. For a 5–7 inch length, your range fits comfortably in the canal’s sensitive zones, allowing precise control over pressure and angle without reaching too deep.
The first physical cue to master is stillness. Hold plank for three deep breaths, inhaling through the nose, exhaling through pursed lips. Feel where your weight rests—forearms, knees, abdomen, and glans—and adjust until pressure is distributed evenly. You want to feel balanced but not heavy. Think of your hips as a compass suspended in space, pivoting freely between north, south, east, and west. This metaphor keeps you aware of rotational balance instead of linear drive. Every breath begins to teach you how control and freedom coexist in this stroke.
From stillness, begin micro adjustments. On each exhale, allow your hips to lean a centimeter left, then return to center on the inhale. Then lean right and return again. This controlled swaying is the first form of Angling—the body’s way of mapping her walls. Keep the depth shallow at eighty percent and pressure light to medium. Her cues will be subtle: a deeper breath, a faint curl of her hips, or a small stilling of her abdomen. These signs mean the wall contact is clean. If she stiffens or pulls back, reduce angle or lighten pressure. The SSP loop begins even here—Observe, Tweak, Test—always refining.
Your breath acts as the rhythm engine. Inhale to gather, exhale to move, inhale to reset. Never rush the return to baseline. The slower the recovery, the clearer your tactile feedback becomes. For endomorph trainees, focus on keeping hips buoyant by driving motion from the abdomen rather than pushing with thighs or glutes. This keeps weight off her pelvis and protects your knees. If strain builds in your shoulders, press slightly through your forearms to lift the chest a half inch, redistributing load evenly. The priority is endurance through alignment, not force.
As you settle into this orientation, practice transitions between motion and stillness. After each lean, return to baseline and hold for one full breath. Feel how stillness magnifies the next movement’s clarity. Each repetition becomes smoother, more intuitive. Her body will start to mirror you—small breaths syncing to yours, hips gently receptive. This responsiveness is how you know your alignment is correct. The stroke’s efficiency grows from this initial calibration, not from strength or speed.
End each session with a one-sentence reflection in your journal: “Centered forearm-plank, shallow contact, even breath, hips balanced.” This note trains awareness and sets a baseline for the next module. The goal is for your body to memorize this feeling of effortless steadiness before any keystroke work begins.

=============================================================================================


Module 2 isolates and develops the keystrokes that form the Egyptian Small Circles: the Diagonal Lean, the Hip Sweep, and the Center Return. Each keystroke functions as a building block—learned separately, then later combined into the full circular rhythm. You begin each movement from the same neutral forearm-plank baseline, keeping your breath steady, depth shallow at eighty percent, and pressure in the Light-to-Medium range. The goal here is not intensity but accuracy—training your body to move as if drawing circles with the pelvis instead of thrusting forward and back.
Start with the Diagonal Lean. From your neutral plank, inhale to prepare and exhale as you angle your hips left, letting the glans shift toward her right wall. The motion comes from your abdominal compression and side-body control, not from shoulder or leg drive. This keystroke is purely Angling—it tilts the penis toward one lateral wall while keeping full length contact along the lower canal. Maintain a Light pressure, staying shallow so the tip can trace texture instead of pressing into resistance. Her cue will often be a quiet exhale or slight hip press to meet you, signaling that the angle feels natural. For an endomorph, resist letting your body weight sink—lift slightly through the chest and use the belly’s firmness to steer motion. For a 5–7 inch range, the angle allows deep sensation without loss of mobility, preserving precision.
Next, move into the Hip Sweep. From the left lean, rotate your hips to the right in a slow, curved glide. This is a Rocking motion—fluid, rhythmic, and circular. The glans travels across the south wall, brushing through the mid ten percent zone as you complete the arc toward her left side. Pressure here increases to Medium, exhaled smoothly through the mouth. This keystroke trains Flow—it’s what creates the orbit that defines Egyptian Small Circles. For an endomorph body, stability is key: maintain tension through the abs and keep knees grounded so the hips can pivot freely without collapsing the lumbar spine. You’ll know the motion is right when her breath deepens or a soft pelvic curl draws you in. If she tenses or withdraws, reduce pressure slightly and shorten the sweep’s diameter.
The final keystroke is the Center Return. After completing the rotation, inhale to draw the hips back to center, letting the penis re-align with the downward diagonal. This movement is a Rocking-Angling hybrid—it combines backward glide with subtle realignment. Keep pressure Light and reestablish the shallow eighty percent depth. This reset clears sensory noise and keeps the next rotation clean. It’s part of the Tracking phase—building sensitivity to small shifts in texture and pressure. For an endomorph, the main cue is abdominal lift; the motion should feel like gently pulling the hips upward from the core rather than pushing backward with legs. Her signal that the reset worked is usually a sigh or stillness—a readiness for the next pass.
Together, these keystrokes form a rhythm cycle: Lean to angle, Sweep to flow, Return to reset. The body must memorize each one before chaining them. Begin practice by spending two to three minutes per keystroke, keeping breath consistent and range contained. The metaphor here is of polishing a smooth stone—each repetition refines surface feel, eliminating rough edges until motion becomes effortless. The lean shapes the path, the sweep fills it with motion, and the return clears it again for precision.
As your training stabilizes, note how each keystroke feels in relation to her cues. Record single-line reflections like, “Left lean steady, right sweep smoother, return light.” These micro-observations are your tactile journal entries—evidence that sensitivity is sharpening and endurance is forming without overexertion. By mastering these three foundations, you’ll have all the ingredients necessary to build the continuous, circular stroke rhythm in the next module.
Ready to proceed to Module 3 for Egyptian Small Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=============================================================================================




Module 3 teaches you to merge the three keystrokes—Diagonal Lean, Hip Sweep, and Center Return—into one fluid, continuous rhythm. The focus is chaining movement without losing posture, pressure control, or breath integrity. Think of it as drawing a perfect circle with your hips while your upper body remains quiet. You start every repetition from a clean neutral forearm-plank baseline, spine long, knees supporting weight, and breath setting tempo. The transition from separate keystrokes to one circular sequence requires slowing down and letting the motion loop naturally through Rocking and Angling phases.
Begin by taking one full breath to ground yourself. On the inhale, stabilize your abdomen and lift slightly through your chest. On the exhale, let the pelvis lean left into the Diagonal Lean, guiding the glans toward her right inner wall. Without pausing, rotate through the Hip Sweep, curving across the south wall in one smooth arc toward her left wall. Continue the exhale as you complete the sweep; let it feel like tracing a crescent shape along her inner floor. At the end of the rotation, inhale to draw the hips back to center for the Center Return, realigning your body to the downward diagonal baseline. The motion should never stop—it flows seamlessly from lean to sweep to return, creating an unbroken orbit that she feels as a gentle internal spiral.
The key here is breath-timing. Every exhale drives the movement, every inhale resets control. For a 5–7 inch range, stay primarily in the shallow 80% depth with occasional grazing into the mid 10% during the sweep. Endomorph trainees should maintain strong abdominal support to prevent the pelvis from sagging. The goal is not power but roundness—each circle should feel symmetrical in speed and depth. Watch her cues closely. When the rhythm is right, her breath will lengthen and hips will subtly follow your orbit. If she tenses or holds breath, reduce circle size or lighten pressure. The SSP loop applies constantly: observe her response, tweak pressure or angle, and test again until the flow feels mutual.
After several minutes of chaining, you will begin to feel the neural link between motion and breath. The muscles along your abdomen, obliques, and lower back synchronize with the glide of the pelvis. The movement begins to require less thought, allowing sensory focus to shift from technique to texture. For her, this feels like endless motion—each rotation blending into the next, warmth building without abrupt peaks. For you, it feels like steering a slow current, your hips tracing energy rather than force. This is the first sign that the stroke logic has taken hold.
When fatigue sets in, reset to neutral plank. Inhale fully, lift slightly through your core, and let the pelvis rest back on your heels for a few seconds. This rest keeps endurance sustainable and joints safe. Then return to the baseline and rebuild the circle at half tempo, focusing on smoothness instead of speed. Over time, this alternating rhythm—flow, rest, rebuild—builds both stamina and sensitivity. Each repetition engrains the circular pathway into muscle memory, preparing the body for longer, more precise Flow sessions in the next module.
Finish the session by noting a single journal line that captures your tactile feedback. Write something like, “Full rotation smooth, shallow 80%, steady breath, hips stable.” That sentence anchors the feeling for your next session, turning awareness into data.
Ready to proceed to Module 4 for Egyptian Small Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=============================================================================================


Module 4 begins your first full Tracking Phase for Egyptian Small Circles. This is where you run controlled test loops to find the most reliable angle, wall, and pressure for her body. You will operate entirely within the shallow 80% depth, treating each repetition as an experiment. The goal is to use the SSP loop—Define, Hypothesize, Track, Refine—to understand how small variations in your orbit affect her cues and your stability. Every action begins and ends at a neutral forearm-plank baseline.
Start by defining your baseline motion: a small, even circle centered around her south wall, with pressure at a medium band. Your abdomen should be firm but not tense. On the inhale, stabilize; on the exhale, roll through the circle once. Do five cycles at this default setting, keeping your eyes on the rhythm of her breath. A deep inhale or hip pull is a positive cue. A stiffening thigh or stillness is a negative cue. Note what you see without judgment. This is your first data set.
Next, form a simple hypothesis. For example, you might think that increasing pressure slightly at the east wall could trigger a deeper reaction. Run three slow circles with a light-to-medium pressure build on that quadrant only. Observe her response—does her breath deepen, or does she shift away? Record the change. Then return to baseline for two breaths to neutralize the system before trying again. This keeps the data clean and prevents fatigue.
Now test tempo variation. Slow your orbit to half-speed, keeping pressure constant. Endomorph trainees can use the stronger hip mass to their advantage here, letting the body weight carry momentum instead of muscle effort. If her breath synchronizes with yours or her hips follow the motion, mark that as your current best rhythm. Use the journal shorthand: “South wall, med pressure, slow tempo—breath matched@5.” This line preserves your hypothesis for future refinement.
Once you find a stable response, track it for several sets. Do five to seven circles at that setting, pausing for one deep inhale between each set. Stay alert for drift—if her engagement fades, either pressure or compass may have slipped. Reset to neutral plank, exhale tension out, then re-enter the stroke from a clean start. Never chase sensation; your job here is to map patterns, not maximize pleasure. The mapping phase creates the mental model that allows instinctive control later.
Reflection is critical. Ask yourself afterward: which wall made her breathe deeper? Which tempo felt effortless in your hips? Which pressure range caused fatigue or joint strain? For your build, medium pressure with stable breath typically provides the best feedback loop. Endomorph structure gives you mechanical stability; use that to fine-tune precision instead of pushing depth. The 5–7 inch range should maintain full motion in the shallow zone, saving mid and deep for controlled later tests.
End the session by returning to complete stillness. Hold the neutral plank for one full breath, then rest back on your knees. Let the sensations settle. Note one line in your journal like, “Best loop south wall, med pressure, slow pace, deep breath mirrored.” This captures the data cleanly. The next module will teach you how to sustain that discovered flow beyond the testing phase without losing control.
Ready to proceed to Module 5 for Egyptian Small Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=============================================================================================




Module 5 is your Flow Phase—the first time Egyptian Small Circles are sustained as a single living rhythm. You are no longer dissecting motion or testing hypotheses. You are keeping the circle alive, smooth, and self-propelling inside the shallow 80 percent of depth. The goal is to make the movement so steady that breath, hips, and wall contact merge into one continuous pattern you can hold for minutes without collapse.
Begin from a clean forearm-plank baseline. Inhale deeply to lengthen the spine, exhale until the abdomen firms and the pelvis settles into its natural hover. Your 5–7 inch range fits the canal perfectly at this zone; penetration remains full but safe, never bottoming out. For an Endomorph frame, keep the weight distributed forward through the chest and forearms so the hips float rather than sink. That alignment lets you glide without grinding.
Start the circle. On the inhale, stabilize. On the exhale, roll your hips through the orbit once. The motion combines light rocking and subtle angling: forward-right-back-left, like tracing a coin on a table. The head of your shaft massages the right wall during the eastward drift, then the left wall on the westward return, with the south wall kissed lightly at the curve. Pressure stays light-to-medium, guided by breath. Ten slow circles form your first set.
After each set, pause in neutral for one full breath. This pause resets alignment and lets her body signal readiness. Look for cues: hips drawing in, breath lengthening, thighs relaxing. Those are green lights to continue. If she stiffens or exhales sharply, stay shallow for a few rounds until her rhythm softens again. Flow is a conversation, not a push.
Once the motion feels smooth, extend duration. Perform three consecutive sets of twenty circles, resting only two breaths between. Each exhale drives the orbit; each inhale re-centers your spine. Endomorph trainees can use body weight as ballast—let gravity, not effort, maintain the glide. Avoid pressing the belly down; keep a fingertip’s space of air between your abdominals and hers. That micro-gap preserves circulation and stamina.
Halfway through the session, test micro-adjustments. Shift the orbit a few degrees clockwise for five circles, then counterclockwise. You are searching for the axis where her breath deepens most. That’s your flow line. Once found, lock in and maintain it at a constant tempo—roughly one circle per exhale. If you lose rhythm, return to baseline, breathe twice, and restart from stillness. The discipline is in resetting without frustration.
By minute eight or nine, movement will feel automatic. You will sense warmth rising through the pelvis, each rotation pulling her deeper into the pulse. Do not chase speed. Stay slow, supple, circular. When both bodies are breathing together, the stroke becomes self-sustaining; you can hold it indefinitely.
End the session with stillness. Hold plank for one breath, withdraw slowly, and rest back on your heels. Journal one line in shorthand: “Flow held 3 × 20 circles, medium pressure, south wall melt at @18.” That record anchors the feel for your next module, where you will begin exploring depth transitions.
Ready to proceed to Module 6 for Egyptian Small Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=============================================================================================


Module 6 is where you open the deep option for Egyptian Small Circles. You are no longer testing or stabilizing—now you explore expansion into the mid and deep 10% with control. The aim is not to go deeper just because you can, but to understand when the body, breath, and her cues permit it. This module teaches how to enter, hold, and retreat from depth without breaking the circular rhythm or the trust in the motion.
Start from a neutral forearm plank baseline. Inhale deeply to engage your core and lift your sternum slightly; exhale through your mouth to drop your pelvis back into the shallow 80% zone. Run five slow circles to reestablish flow. Once your body feels synchronized, prepare for the first depth test. On your next inhale, compress your abdomen gently and shift your weight a few degrees forward—no thrusting, only an angling adjustment through the hips. On the exhale, trace one circle that extends two finger-widths deeper than before. Maintain light pressure on the entry and let the depth occur naturally on the south wall. If you feel resistance or her breath stalls, return instantly to shallow orbit. The rule is simple: her breath is your depth gauge.
In a 5–7 inch range, the safe deep pocket is often around 90% of full insertion, never full press. You are gliding into the soft back wall, not punching through it. Endomorph stability allows you to control this with weight rather than muscle strain—think of letting gravity settle your hips forward instead of driving them. Keep pressure medium, never hard. The goal is sustained contact with the cervix-adjacent zone without compressing it. The most efficient breath pattern is inhale for half the orbit, exhale for the descent, slight hold at the base, then inhale to draw back. This four-beat rhythm keeps circulation and sensitivity intact.
Lubrication must stay consistent; any tackiness breaks the circle and causes friction spikes. If you feel drag, pause at shallow 80%, re-lubricate, or let her adjust angle. Communication here is subtle—watch for pelvic curls, thigh rotation, or quiet moans. Those mean permission to maintain or repeat that depth. If she freezes or breathes high in her chest, you have hit a boundary; pull back immediately. Treat each deep entry like a guest passing a guarded door.
When done correctly, the deep phase of the Small Circle feels like a gravitational pull inward. You will sense the rear wall receive and roll around the glans; she will often exhale or hum softly. The motion feels tighter, slower, and more magnetic. You must resist the urge to accelerate. Stay within three or four deep rotations before resetting to shallow for a minute. This alternation—deep for three, shallow for twelve—creates a rhythm wave that expands both bodies’ capacity without overstimulation.
After ten minutes, stop completely. Rest back on your knees, breathe into your abdomen, and note how your spine feels. Endomorphs should pay attention to lumbar tension—if it’s tight, add a forward stretch before continuing. Reflect on how your breath timing shifted at depth and what cues she gave you. Write one line in your journal such as, “Depth 90%, south wall contact steady, breath sync intact.” That record preserves the tactile intelligence for future refinement.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for Egyptian Small Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=============================================================================================




Module 7 brings you to Pinning Strategy, where you learn how to use the Egyptian Small Circles after she’s already released. Flow becomes precision now. The purpose is to re-enter her post-orgasmic body with the lightest possible control, to create new waves without breaking the calm. You’re using the same circle logic—but slower, smaller, and with surgical awareness of angle, breath, and pressure.
Start from neutral forearm plank. Both bodies quiet. The canal will feel warmer, looser, and highly reactive. This is not the time for thrusting or speed; it’s about holding presence inside her. Inhale through your nose, expand the abdomen, then exhale slowly as you let the hips sink just enough for full shallow contact. The orbit you trace is miniature now—one-third the original radius. Keep to the shallow 80% zone. The glans should travel only a thumb’s width across the east and west walls.
On the next exhale, begin the circle. Medium pressure on the entry, light across the midline, and a subtle upward angle through the south-east quadrant. That diagonal lifts her internal floor just enough to restart pulsing. Watch for her body’s cues: a deeper breath, a soft pelvic curl, or an unconscious hum. Those signals mean the nerve field is reigniting. Maintain that micro-orbit until her hips begin to follow you. That’s the moment you test the SSP Observe-Tweak-Test loop.
Observe: sense where her tension collects—right wall, left wall, or base.
Tweak: adjust the orbit two degrees toward that wall, keep pressure light.
Test: run three orbits and read the response. If breath deepens, stay. If she exhales sharply or hips pull away, return to baseline. This process is continuous calibration, not performance.
For a 5–7 inch range, your control window is ideal; full depth is unnecessary. The glans alone can restart her contractions. Endomorph structure helps you hover steadily without collapse—use that stability. Keep your spine long, shoulders low, weight through the forearms. Never chase friction; chase stillness that trembles. If you sense her pulse quicken again, drop into two slightly wider circles at medium pressure, then immediately shrink back to miniature orbit. That surge-and-retreat pattern triggers multiple orgasms without overstimulation.
Each burst should last no more than fifteen seconds. Between bursts, hold fully still for two breaths. The stillness is as important as the motion; it lets her nervous system reset. Over five minutes, repeat this pattern three to four times. The arc will feel like waves: rise, crest, dissolve, silence. Your job is to keep the body relaxed enough to follow each wave naturally.
After the final burst, stay inside her at shallow depth and breathe together. Let your heartbeat slow until both rhythms sync. Then withdraw with a single smooth exhale. Endomorph trainees should immediately stretch the lower back to release tension and keep hips loose.
Journal one clear line to capture the test result: “Mini-orbit east-south 2°, light pressure, three bursts, breath sync returned.” That line becomes your cue reference for repetition and refinement.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for Egyptian Small Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=============================================================================================




Module 8 completes the Egyptian Small Circles sequence by turning everything you’ve learned into a four-week training rhythm. The goal now is continuity—building muscle memory, stamina, and sensitivity without strain. You’ll work in daily or alternate-day sessions, always prioritizing baseline alignment, breath discipline, and controlled progression from shallow flow to pinning precision.
Week One is foundation. Every session begins with three minutes of breath anchoring in forearm plank. Inhale through the nose for a four-count, exhale for six. This stabilizes the abdominal wall and trains endurance through the shoulders and core. Practice shallow orbits only—no deeper than 80%. Perform five sets of fifteen circles, pausing between each set for two full breaths. Focus on making every circle smooth and identical. Endomorphs should monitor weight placement: keep the chest light, hips steady, thighs parallel, and distribute contact through the forearms instead of the lower back. Record simple sensory notes like, “South wall clear, no tension, breath matched.”
Week Two is consolidation. Add small variations in compass orientation. Rotate the orbit slightly clockwise for one set, then counterclockwise for the next. This trains directional precision and helps identify which wall responds best. Maintain shallow 80% depth; the 5–7 inch range is optimal here. Use medium pressure throughout, inhaling to rise slightly on the north arc, exhaling to descend south. By now, the circle should feel self-propelled. Avoid forcing intensity. If fatigue builds in your core or wrists, pause and stretch before continuing. Your focus is effortless motion, not power.
Week Three introduces dynamic control. Alternate between full shallow flow sets and micro-pin sequences. Start with two minutes of continuous orbits, then shift to miniature circles for one minute while maintaining penetration. This trains your ability to transition between expansion and containment, mirroring real intimacy. Use the SSP loop during each micro phase: observe her response, tweak angle or pressure slightly, test for resonance. Note what produces breath deepening or pelvic curl. Keep strokes slow and precise; speed erases information.
Week Four integrates everything. Begin each session with breath anchoring, then move through all three layers—foundation flow, dynamic variation, and controlled pinning—in one sequence. Maintain awareness of the 80–10–10 principle: most of your motion shallow, a little midrange, rare touches of deeper testing. This ratio preserves sensitivity and prevents desensitization. For endurance, aim for fifteen total minutes of practice with short pauses every five minutes to reset alignment and observe your own heartbeat. End each session with three full breaths in stillness, spine long, pelvis neutral, mind quiet.
Across these four weeks, progress isn’t about stronger motion but cleaner control. The Egyptian Small Circles should evolve from deliberate practice into intuitive rhythm—a movement that emerges naturally when the body relaxes. Your journal is your map. Each entry should fit in one line, noting compass, pressure, and effect, such as “Clockwise 15°, medium pressure, melt on right wall @rep12.” Review your notes weekly to track refinement.
By the end of the month, your endurance will double, your wall sensitivity will sharpen, and your confidence in micro control will be instinctive. You’ll have transformed the stroke from a learned exercise into a native motion, one you can summon at will, calibrated by breath, guided by feel, and sustained by balance.
