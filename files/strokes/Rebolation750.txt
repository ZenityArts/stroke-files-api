Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Rebloation Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m proud to guide you through this program designed specifically for ectomorphs with an extension above 7 inches. Your lean, agile physique is built for speed and precision; with an extended asset, you have the additional capacity to access deeper zones while delivering stimulus with pinpoint accuracy. Though your frame is slender, every movement you make carries the potential to build cumulative, intense stimulation when executed with the right technique.
Picture yourself stepping into your personal training arena—a quiet, dedicated sanctuary free of distractions, where your complete focus is on mastering this technique. Feel the solid, unwavering ground beneath your feet; it’s as reliable as your own lean frame. Take several deep, centered breaths; with each inhale, draw in pure, concentrated energy, and with each exhale, let go of any tension or distractions. This is your space, brother—a canvas where your natural ectomorphic agility and extended reach transform raw power into a beautifully choreographed performance.
We begin by adopting a modified missionary position that suits your ectomorphic structure. Assume a stable plank position with your knees firmly planted—this anchors your body so that every micro‑movement, from the subtle twist of your hips to the precise directional rotations, is executed with deliberate control. Your long, lean limbs and extended asset allow you to move rapidly and with precision; however, every movement must be calibrated to ensure that your energy is focused where it will deliver maximum stimulation without overwhelming her delicate, nerve‑rich zones.
Once you are firmly in position, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This deliberate insertion is your blueprint—it establishes the precise alignment and pressure points that will dictate the course of your Rebloation Stroke. Your journey begins with a controlled forward push. As you drive your body slowly and deliberately forward toward her head, feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide gracefully over her clitoral region while the head maintains continuous, focused contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, you have the capacity to provide deep stimulation; yet, it is crucial that you adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle by concentrating about 80% of your force on the ultra‑sensitive shallow area (the first 1 to 3 inches) and evenly distributing the remaining 20% between the mid‑depth and deep zones. This balance forms the cornerstone for building cumulative stimulation with every motion.
After that foundational forward push, the Rebloation Stroke unfolds in a sequential pattern of hip rotations. In the first phase, you perform four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation to the right, the hilt of your penis applies focused pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment down through the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. At the same time, the head of your penis changes orientation—initially directing pressure toward the southwestern wall and then shifting to the north‑western wall. Each rotation is a keystroke that layers stimulation, building a cumulative effect as your movement becomes more dynamic.
Next, you transition to the second phase—four individual hip rotations to the left. Here, the process is mirrored: as you rotate to the left, the hilt of your penis canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head first points toward the southeastern wall and then transitions to the north‑eastern wall. This balanced, symmetrical pattern ensures that stimulation is delivered evenly across her entire vaginal opening. After completing the bilateral rotations, the stroke concludes with a lateral shift to the left. This final movement further rounds out the stimulation, ensuring every region receives its cumulative touch.
This introduction lays the foundation for what’s to come, brother. It shows you how to set up your environment, adopt the precise posture, and channel your natural ectomorphic agility and extended asset into the Rebloation Stroke. Welcome, brother—today marks the first step in transforming your raw potential into a masterfully controlled performance of cumulative pleasure.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, and Flow
Alright, brother, let’s break down the core technical principles that underpin your Rebloation Stroke. Understanding these concepts is critical; they form the framework that turns raw power into precise, cumulative stimulation.
Imagine the 80‑10‑10 principle as your force‑distribution blueprint. Essentially, about 80% of the force you deliver should be concentrated on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because this area is packed with nerve endings and is the most sensitive. The remaining 20% of your force is divided evenly so that 10% stimulates the mid‑depth zone (roughly 3 to 5 inches) and 10% is directed to the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an ectomorph with an extended asset above 7 inches, this means that even though your reach allows you to engage deeper areas, the lion’s share of your energy must be focused where it counts the most—in the shallow, ultra‑sensitive region—ensuring a balanced, cumulative build of stimulation.
Next is the Sexual Scientific Process—a methodical approach to refining your technique through continuous feedback and adjustment. The process begins by clearly defining your goal. With the Rebloation Stroke, you might aim to maximize the cumulative effect of each individual hip rotation, so that every movement builds upon the last for a powerful overall result. With your goal set, you form a hypothesis. Perhaps you suspect that a slightly altered rotation speed or a refined hip angle will increase stimulation. Then comes the tracking phase. Here, you perform about 30 repetitions of each movement—each rotation on one “wall” of her vaginal canal—while closely monitoring your body’s responses. Focus on engaging your core and pelvic floor, and most importantly, listen to her feedback. Notice her rhythmic breathing, subtle posture shifts, and any soft verbal signals that point to which actions are most effective. This tracking phase is your real-time feedback loop, allowing you to make precise adjustments as you refine your performance.
Once you have sufficient feedback, you slip into a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical state in which every micro‑movement—from a deliberate forward push to each flawlessly executed hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically in perfect rhythm. When you’re in flow, your body moves as though by instinct, delivering the ideal amount of pressure and timing that tracking has helped you hone. Cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly as your sequence becomes a natural, automatic performance.
While some strokes incorporate a separate “tap keystroke” drill, with the Rebloation Stroke, your focus is on drilling the exact hip rotations and the lateral shift until they become second nature. By isolating and repeating these keystrokes until they are ingrained, you develop muscle memory and the precision required to consistently deliver cumulative stimulation with each rotation.
In summary, the 80‑10‑10 principle ensures that 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, super-sensitive zone, while the remaining force is split evenly between mid‑depth and deep layers; the Sexual Scientific Process—with goal setting, hypothesis, tracking, and flow—provides a systematic roadmap for continuous refinement; and drilling the specific hip rotation keystrokes embeds the necessary precision into your performance. Together, these elements form the complete technical foundation for the Rebloation Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Rebloation Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s deconstruct the Rebloation Stroke step by step to give you a detailed blueprint for transforming your ectomorphic agility and compact extension into cumulative, targeted stimulation. The Rebloation Stroke is executed in the classic missionary position—you're on top in a modified plank with your knees on the canvas, and your penis is inserted at a controlled, downward diagonal angle. The stroke unfolds in a precise, sequential pattern: you perform four individual hip rotations to the right, followed by four individual hip rotations to the left, and then complete the sequence with a lateral shift to the left.
First, you begin with a smooth forward push. From your stable, anchored position, drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head with a steady, deliberate push. As you push, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, intentional contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is below 5 inches, the 80‑10‑10 principle directs that about 80% of your force should target the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining 20% is distributed evenly to the mid‑depth and deep areas. This forward push creates the cumulative base upon which the rotational movements build.
Next, the stroke moves into the directional phase. Begin with four individual hip rotations to the right. As you rotate to the right, focus on the hilt of your penis—feel it apply steady pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment down to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. Concurrently, the head of your penis adjusts its angle: it first directs pressure toward the southwestern wall and then gradually shifts to the north‑western wall with each successive rotation. Each rotation is a distinct keystroke that adds a layer of precise, cumulative stimulation.
After completing the right rotations, smoothly transition to four individual hip rotations to the left. Mirror the process: as you rotate to the left, the hilt canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, and the head initially points toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. This alternating pattern of right and left rotations creates a rhythmic cycle that ensures cumulative stimulation is delivered evenly across her vaginal canal.
Finally, conclude the sequence with a lateral shift to the left. This final movement further enhances the cumulative effect by engaging additional areas of stimulation, ensuring no zone is left untouched. Throughout every part of the sequence, each movement must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is devoted to the sensitive, shallow zone, and the remaining 20% is balanced between the deeper layers.
This step-by-step deconstruction provides a clear roadmap, transforming your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension into a series of meticulously coordinated movements that build cumulative, targeted stimulation with every rotation and shift.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now let’s drill each individual component of the Rebloation Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with absolute precision. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, you’re built for rapid, precise actions—but every hip rotation must be controlled with laser accuracy. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and drill it repeatedly until it’s completely ingrained in your muscle memory, always keeping the 80‑10‑10 principle in mind.
Begin with the forward push drill. In your modified missionary position, with your knees planted on a supportive, stable surface, carefully insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle. Then, slowly execute a forward push toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation—feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head holds steady, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is compact, allocate about 80% of your force to the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. Drill this movement slowly and methodically until your forward push becomes smooth and automatic.
Next, isolate the hip rotations. Start with a single rotation to the right. From your starting position, execute one deliberate hip rotation to the right and concentrate on the hilt of your penis as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head first directs pressure toward the southwestern wall before shifting to the north‑western wall. Perform one rotation slowly, then reset and repeat for at least 30 repetitions until your muscles develop precise memory. Then, switch to drilling a single rotation to the left. As you rotate to the left, feel the hilt canvas from the north‑western to the south‑western segment while the head initially directs pressure toward the southeastern wall and then transitions to the north‑eastern wall. Alternate these rotations until you achieve seamless transitions and every move respects the 80‑10‑10 force distribution.
Once you’ve perfected the individual rotations, drill the final lateral shift to the left. Practice moving your body laterally until you complete a fluid shift to the left, ensuring that the force distribution stays consistent with the 80‑10‑10 principle. Repeat this movement until it blends naturally with the rotations.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing—each deep inhale fueling your next move, and every deliberate exhale ensuring smooth transitions between actions. Although the Rebloation Stroke’s keystrokes are inherent to the hip rotations rather than a separate drill, rigorous repetition of each component will build the requisite muscle memory to deliver cumulative stimulation with consistency and precision.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to synthesize all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Rebloation Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance, with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your focus entirely on linking every micro‑movement into an uninterrupted, rhythmic cycle. In this integrated sequence, you will combine your deliberate forward push with the sequence of four hip rotations to the right, followed by four hip rotations to the left, and then finish with a lateral shift to the left to complete the stroke.
Begin with the forward push. From your secure, anchored position, insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push, executed according to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensures that about 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone—setting a cumulative base for the rotations that follow.
Immediately after the forward push, initiate the first phase: four individual hip rotations to the right. As you perform each rotation, focus on the hilt steadily canvassing the vaginal opening from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment, while the head transitions its pressure from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. These rotations are executed sequentially, with each repetition adding to the cumulative stimulation.
Then, without delay, transition to the mirror phase: four individual hip rotations to the left. As you rotate left, let the hilt canvas from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head first points toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall. This alternating pattern creates a rhythmic balance in stimulation across her vaginal canal.
Finally, complete the sequence with one smooth lateral shift to the left. This final shift helps round out the stroke, ensuring that every section of her vaginal canal receives its share of the cumulative stimulation built during the hip rotations. Throughout the integrated sequence, every movement adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that the shallow, ultra‑sensitive area receives about 80% of the force while the remaining force is balanced to provide a controlled, cumulative effect.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale primes you for the next precise motion, and every controlled exhale facilitates smooth transitions between the forward push, the hip rotations, and the lateral shift. With every complete cycle, your Rebloation Stroke transforms into a continuous, fluid performance that fuses your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension into a finely choreographed display of cumulative stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase—where every micro‑movement of your Rebloation Stroke is refined until your performance becomes a seamlessly executed masterpiece. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, precision is paramount. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains your guiding star: around 80% of your applied force must focus on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you perform your integrated cycle, pay close attention to each detail. During your forward push, ensure the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region, and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” In executing the four hip rotations to the right followed by four to the left, observe carefully how the hilt canvasses each segment of her vaginal opening, and how the head adjusts its orientation—first pressing toward one wall and then shifting to the opposite wall. This is where tracking becomes indispensable. With each repetition, listen intently to her deep, rhythmic breathing, note any subtle shifts in her posture, and focus on soft verbal cues that indicate which aspects of your stroke build the most cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your immediate feedback loop—allowing you to make fine-tuned adjustments to your speed, force, or angle as needed.
Once you’ve gathered enough tracking data—aiming for about 30 repetitions per phase—you naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical state where every micro‑movement—from your forward push to each meticulously executed hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically. In this state, you deliver the exact pressure and timing that your tracking has refined, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with every cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is crucial during flow; every deep inhale prepares you for the next movement, and every controlled exhale smooths out the transitions. And if any movement seems even slightly off, pause, track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is flawless.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training program designed to reinforce every element of your Rebloation Stroke while strengthening your core and overall stability. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, your speed, precision, and rapid responsiveness are your greatest assets. This routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that consistently delivers cumulative, targeted stimulation.
Begin by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where your full focus is on honing your technique. Every training session should start with an extensive warm‑up tailored to your ectomorphic structure. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these muscle groups form the basis of your stability, ensuring that every precise movement is executed with perfect accuracy. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the rapid drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and establish a determined, positive mindset.
Next, move into your specialized drills, beginning with the forward push. In your modified missionary position, carefully insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and practice a smooth, deliberate forward push toward your partner’s head. Ensure that about 80% of your force is directed toward the shallow, sensitive zone. Once you’ve mastered this, proceed to drill the individual hip rotations. Start by isolating the right rotations—practice each rotation slowly and with complete control until the hilt consistently canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, while the head shifts from the southwestern to the north‑western wall. Repeat for at least 30 reps. Then, mirror the process with left hip rotations until the movement is seamless. Finally, drill the lateral shift that completes the stroke, ensuring it flows naturally with your rotations. Alternate these drills until every keystroke of the Rebloation Stroke is ingrained in your muscle memory.
Throughout your training session, maintain deep, controlled breathing—each deep inhale fuels your precise movements, while every slow exhale ensures smooth transitions. Supplement your drills with core-strengthening exercises like planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability workouts—your core is the anchor that guarantees every rapid movement is executed with maximum precision. Lastly, keep a detailed training journal where you log every session—record repetitions, note adjustments, and capture her feedback. This journal is an essential component of the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to track progress and continually refine your technique until it’s perfected.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we enter the advanced integration phase—the culmination of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Rebloation Stroke merges into one continuous, flawless performance. In this final module, your lean, agile ectomorphic build and your compact extension come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of mastery that is both scientifically refined and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified missionary stance—with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core fully engaged, and your mind tuned for absolute precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you drive forward, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone, while the remaining force is carefully balanced to stimulate the deeper layers.
Immediately, transition into the hip rotation phase by executing four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation, focus on the hilt applying consistent, targeted pressure—canvas it from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment—while the head first directs pressure toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall. Then, seamlessly transition into four individual rotations to the left—mirroring the process, with the hilt canvassing from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and the head shifting from the southeastern to the north‑eastern wall. Finally, complete the cycle with one controlled lateral shift to the left to round out the sequence. Throughout the entire performance, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale energizes your precise movement, and each controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions.
If any aspect of your performance is even slightly off—if a rotation lacks precision or the pressure distribution seems unbalanced—pause, re-track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is flawless. The ultimate goal is to reach a state of natural flow—a condition where every forward push, every hip rotation, and every lateral shift occurs automatically with impeccable precision and cumulative intensity. When that state is achieved, your Rebloation Stroke will have evolved into a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers targeted, cumulative stimulation that drives her to climax.
