Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Rebloation Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m excited to work with you on a program designed especially for mesomorphs with an extension below 5 inches. Your physique represents a perfect blend of muscular definition and balance. While your extension might be compact compared to others, every inch of it holds tremendous sensitivity that, when harnessed correctly, can deliver remarkably cumulative stimulation. Today, we’re going to show you how to channel your natural strength and refined motor control into the Rebloation Stroke—a technique that uses sequential hip rotations to build layered, precise stimulation throughout your partner’s canal.
Picture yourself stepping into your personal training space—a quiet, dedicated sanctuary where all distractions fade away and your focus is entirely on mastering this skill. Feel the firm, supportive ground beneath you; it mirrors the stability of your mesomorph build. Take several deep, measured breaths; with each inhale, draw in concentrated energy, and with each exhale, release every trace of tension. This is your arena, brother—a space where your raw, honed potential is transformed into a performance that delivers cumulative, targeted stimulation with every deliberate movement.
We begin with a modification of the classic missionary position to suit your athletic mesomorph frame. Assume a modified plank position with your knees on a stable surface that supports your moderate mass. This anchoring stance is critical—it locks your body into position so that every micro‑movement, from the controlled twist of your hips to the final lateral shift, is executed with deliberate precision. Your natural muscularity provides you with both agility and power; however, with a compact extension below 5 inches, precision becomes your guiding principle. Every move must be controlled, ensuring that your force is delivered exactly where it is most effective without overwhelming her sensitive, nerve‑rich areas.
Once you’re securely anchored, you carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Think of this insertion as the blueprint for your stroke—it establishes the precise alignment and pressure points for every subsequent movement. Your journey with the Rebloation Stroke follows a structured sequence: you start with a forward push, then perform four individual hip rotations to the right, followed by four individual hip rotations to the left, and finally, you complete the cycle with a lateral shift to the left. In each hip rotation, the hilt of your penis applies focused pressure along a specific segment of her vaginal opening, while the head adjusts its angle—first pressing toward one side and then shifting to the opposite side, building cumulative stimulation steadily with each rotation.
Because you’re a mesomorph with a compact extension, you have excellent muscular control and agility—but precision is crucial. You must ensure that approximately 80% of your force is dedicated to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone (the first 1 to 3 inches) while the remaining 20% is carefully distributed between the mid‑depth and deep zones. This balanced force allocation is the cornerstone of cumulative stimulation, ensuring that every rotation adds layer after layer of targeted pleasure.
This introduction sets the stage for your training, brother. Here, you learn how to establish your environment, adopt the ideal posture, and channel your natural mesomorph power into a Rebloation Stroke that transforms raw strength into a refined, cumulative performance. Today marks the beginning of turning your potential into a true work of intimate art—a performance that proves every inch counts when executed with precision and cumulative intent.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, the Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, and Flow
Alright, brother, let’s break down the core technical principles that underpin your Rebloation Stroke. Understanding these concepts is essential for turning raw power into cumulative, targeted stimulation. We’ll cover the 80‑10‑10 principle, outline the Sexual Scientific Process, and explain how tracking and flow contribute to perfecting your technique.
Imagine the 80‑10‑10 principle as your force‑distribution blueprint. Essentially, about 80% of the force you deliver should be concentrated on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because this is the area with the highest density of nerve endings, making it extremely sensitive. The remaining 20% isn’t lost; it’s split evenly with 10% directed toward the mid‑depth zone (roughly 3 to 5 inches) and 10% toward the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as a mesomorph with a compact extension below 5 inches, this principle is crucial. While your naturally athletic build allows you to generate quick and powerful movements, most of your energy must be concentrated on that ultra-sensitive shallow area to create cumulative stimulation. This careful balancing ensures that stimulation builds gradually and evenly, preventing any one area from becoming over- or under-stimulated.
Next, let’s delve into the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic, iterative method for refining your technique over time. This process begins by clearly defining your goal. In the context of the Rebloation Stroke, your goal might be to maximize the cumulative impact of each individual hip rotation. With your goal in place, you then form a hypothesis. For example, you might suspect that slightly slower, more controlled rotations would increase the pressure on the sensitive shallow zone or that adjusting your hip angle can enhance overall stimulation. Once your hypothesis is established, you move into the tracking phase. During tracking, you methodically perform around 30 repetitions of each segment—each individual hip rotation—while closely monitoring your body’s cues (engaging your strong core and pelvic muscles) and, most importantly, listening to your partner’s feedback. Her deep, rhythmic breathing, subtle postural shifts, and gentle verbal cues provide real‑time data that you use to fine‑tune your technique. Tracking is that immediate feedback loop that lets you adjust your movements until each rotation is perfectly calibrated.
Once you’ve gathered enough data through tracking, you eventually slip into a state of flow. Flow is an almost magical state of seamless, automatic performance where each micro‑movement—from your deliberate forward push to every precisely executed hip rotation—occurs in perfect harmony. When you’re in flow, your body no longer hesitates or overthinks each movement; it executes them with the refined pressure and timing that tracking has helped you achieve, resulting in effortless cumulative stimulation.
For the Rebloation Stroke, your keystrokes are inherent in the controlled hip rotations and the final lateral shift; these are the core movements you drill until they become second nature. It’s not a separate drill like the tap keystroke in other strokes—the precision comes from repeating the exact rotations until the cumulative pattern is ingrained in your muscle memory.
To summarize: • The 80‑10‑10 principle directs 80% of your force to the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone, with the remaining 20% equally split between the mid‑depth and deep areas. • The Sexual Scientific Process—through goal setting, hypothesis formation, meticulous tracking, and transitioning into flow—provides the step‑by‑step roadmap to refine your technique continuously. • Drilling the specific keystrokes of the Rebloation Stroke (the individual hip rotations and the concluding lateral shift) embeds the necessary precision into your performance, ensuring each move builds cumulative stimulation effectively.
These principles form the foundation of your training—ensuring every move you make is scientifically sound and artistically executed to maximize pleasure.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Rebloation Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Rebloation Stroke into a clear, detailed sequence so that you have an exact roadmap for turning your natural mesomorph agility and compact extension into cumulative, targeted stimulation. The Rebloation Stroke is performed in the classic missionary position: you’re on top in a modified plank with your knees planted on the canvas, and your penis is inserted at a controlled, downward diagonal angle. Once inserted, the stroke unfolds in a very structured pattern: first, you execute four individual hip rotations to the right; then, you perform four individual hip rotations to the left; and finally, you complete the pattern with one lateral shift to the left.
Let’s begin with the forward push—the essential foundation of the stroke. From your secure, anchored position, drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head in a smooth, deliberate motion. As you move forward, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head maintains continuous, targeted contact with her “south wall.” Since your extension is below 5 inches, the 80‑10‑10 principle tells you to focus around 80% of your force on the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining force is evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This forward push creates a strong cumulative base upon which the subsequent hip rotations will build additional layers of stimulation.
Next, we move into the first phase of the rotational sequence: performing four individual hip rotations to the right. As you initiate each rotation to the right, concentrate on how the hilt of your penis applies consistent pressure—as it “canvasses” from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, note how the head of your penis adjusts its direction—first pressing toward the southwestern wall and then gradually shifting to the north‑western wall with each successive rotation. Each rotation is a precise keystroke that adds a distinct layer of stimulation, so that the overall effect builds cumulatively, stroke after stroke.
After finishing the right-side rotations, transition immediately to the second phase: performing four individual hip rotations to the left. In this phase, mirror the process: as you rotate to the left, the hilt applies pressure by canvassing from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head initially directs its pressure toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. This alternating pattern of right and left rotations creates a rhythmic, cumulative cycle that ensures stimulation is evenly distributed across her vaginal canal.
Finally, round out the pattern with one additional lateral shift to the left. This final move further reinforces the cumulative effect by ensuring that any areas that may have received less stimulation during the rotations are engaged, completing the overall stroke.
Throughout every movement in the sequence, each keystroke is performed in strict accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring approximately 80% of your force is directed at the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone, with the balance spread evenly across deeper layers. This deconstruction gives you a precise, step‑by‑step roadmap for the Rebloation Stroke, transforming your natural mesomorph agility and compact extension into a series of carefully coordinated movements that deliver cumulative, targeted stimulation with every rotation and shift.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now let’s drill each individual component of the Rebloation Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with flawless precision. With your lean, agile mesomorph build and a compact extension below 5 inches, you’re built for quick, precise actions—but each hip rotation must be controlled with surgical accuracy. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and repeat it until it’s fully ingrained in your muscle memory, always keeping the 80‑10‑10 principle in mind.
Start with the forward push drill. In your modified missionary position, with your knees firmly planted on a supportive, stable surface, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Then, slowly execute a forward push toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation—feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head remains in consistent, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is compact, ensure that around 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. Repeat this forward push slowly and methodically until the motion becomes smooth, steady, and completely automatic.
Next, isolate the hip rotation drills. Begin with a single rotation to the right. From your secure position, initiate one deliberate hip rotation to the right and focus on how the hilt of your penis applies steady pressure—“canvassing” from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, observe how the head first directs pressure toward the southwestern wall and then gradually transitions to the north‑western wall. Perform that one rotation slowly, then pause, reset, and repeat for at least 30 repetitions until the movement is fully ingrained in your muscle memory. Then, switch to a single rotation to the left. As you rotate left, ensure that the hilt canvasses smoothly from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head initially directs its pressure toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. Alternate these rotations until you can transition seamlessly between right and left, with each movement adhering strictly to the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
After mastering the individual hip rotations, practice the final lateral shift drill. Slowly shift your entire body laterally to the left, ensuring that the movement is controlled and that your force distribution remains consistent with the 80‑10‑10 principle. Repeat this lateral shift until it naturally flows with the rotations.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing—each deep inhale powers the next precise movement, and every deliberate exhale ensures smooth transitions between actions. By rigorously repeating these keystrokes—the forward push, the right and left hip rotations, and the lateral shift—you build the muscle memory and precision needed to deliver cumulative stimulation flawlessly with your Rebloation Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to bring together all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Rebloation Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance, with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your full focus on linking every micro‑movement into an uninterrupted, rhythmic cycle. In this integrated cycle, you combine a deliberate forward push with four hip rotations to the right, followed by four hip rotations to the left, and you finish with one precise lateral shift to complete the stroke.
Begin with the forward push. From your secure, anchored position, insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide effortlessly over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, intentional contact with her “south wall.” This forward push, executed according to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensures that roughly 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone, creating the strong cumulative base for the subsequent rotations.
Immediately after the forward push, enter the first phase by performing four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation to the right, concentrate on the hilt steadily canvassing from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head transitions smoothly from pointing toward the southwestern wall to shifting toward the north‑western wall. Each right rotation incrementally builds cumulative stimulation.
Once you have completed the right rotations, smoothly transition to four individual hip rotations to the left. As you rotate left, ensure that the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head initially directs its pressure toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. This balanced, alternating pattern ensures that cumulative stimulation is delivered evenly across her vaginal canal.
Finally, complete the integrated sequence with one controlled lateral shift to the left. This final movement reinforces the cumulative effect by ensuring that every part of her canal receives the cumulative stimulation built up by the rotations. Every element of your sequence—forward push, hip rotations, and lateral shift—must conform to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is dedicated to the shallow zone while the rest is evenly distributed across the deeper layers.
Throughout the integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale energizes your next move, and every controlled exhale smooths the transitions. With every complete cycle, your Rebloation Stroke evolves into a continuous, fluid performance that transforms your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension into a finely orchestrated display of cumulative, precise stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase—where every micro‑movement of your Rebloation Stroke is fine-tuned until your performance becomes a flawlessly executed masterpiece of cumulative stimulation. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, every detail is vital, especially during those individual hip rotations. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains your guiding star, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is applied to the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone while the remaining force is evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you perform your integrated cycle, focus intently on the quality and consistency of each movement. During your forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your compact extension glides effortlessly over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When you execute your four right and four left hip rotations, carefully observe how the hilt canvasses the vaginal opening and how the head shifts its focus—first directing pressure toward one wall, then transitioning to the opposite wall. This is where tracking comes into play; every repetition provides immediate, real‑time feedback. Listen closely to her deep, rhythmic breathing; note any subtle shifts in her posture; and be highly attuned to soft verbal cues that indicate which elements of your stroke are most effective. Tracking is your crucial feedback loop, allowing you to make precise, on-the-fly adjustments.
Once you have collected enough tracking data—ideally around 30 repetitions per phase—you’ll naturally transition into a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical condition where every micro‑movement—from your deliberate forward push to each meticulously executed hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically in perfect rhythm. In flow, your body delivers exactly the pressure and timing that your tracking has helped you refine, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with every cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is indispensable during this phase; every deep inhale prepares you for the next movement, and every deliberate exhale smooths the transitions. And if any rotational movement seems slightly off, pause, re‑track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is flawless.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to create your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training program designed to reinforce every element of your Rebloation Stroke while also strengthening your core and overall stability. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, your speed and precision are your greatest assets. This routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that consistently delivers cumulative, targeted stimulation.
Begin by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions fade away and your focus is entirely on perfecting your technique. Every session should begin with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your ectomorphic physique. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these muscle groups form the foundation for your stability and control, ensuring every precise movement is executed flawlessly. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, priming every muscle and joint for the rapid, precise drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and establish a determined, positive tone.
Next, move into your specialized drills. Start with the forward push drill in your modified missionary position. Carefully insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and practice a smooth, deliberate forward push toward your partner’s head. Since your extension is compact, focus approximately 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone. Once you’ve mastered the forward push, isolate and drill the individual hip rotations. Begin with the right rotations—practice each rotation slowly and with full control until the hilt consistently canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment while the head shifts precisely from the southwestern to the north‑western wall. Repeat for at least 30 repetitions until you can execute it naturally. Then, mirror the process with left hip rotations until your movements are seamless. Finally, practice the concluding lateral shift, ensuring it integrates naturally with your rotations. Alternate these drills until every keystroke of the Rebloation Stroke is permanently ingrained in your muscle memory.
Throughout your practice session, maintain deep, controlled breathing to support every movement. Supplement your drills with targeted core-strengthening exercises—such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability workouts—because your core is the anchor that ensures every rapid movement is executed with maximum precision. Lastly, keep a detailed training journal where you record each session, note the number of repetitions, document any adjustments you make, and capture her feedback. This journal is an essential tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, allowing you to track progress and continuously refine your technique until it’s perfected.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—the pinnacle of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Rebloation Stroke converges into one continuous, seamless performance. In this final module, your lean, agile ectomorphic build and compact extension come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of mastery that is both scientifically refined and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified missionary stance—with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core fully engaged, and your mind locked in on perfection. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is directed to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone while the remaining 20% is carefully distributed to stimulate the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately after your forward push, transition into the hip rotation phase by executing four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation, focus on the hilt applying consistent, targeted pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head gradually shifts from directing pressure toward the southwestern wall to moving toward the north‑western wall. Then, seamlessly transition into four individual hip rotations to the left. As you rotate left, ensure that the hilt canvasses smoothly from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head initially points toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall. Finally, complete the integrated sequence with one controlled lateral shift to the left. This final move reinforces the cumulative effect by ensuring that all areas of her vaginal canal receive the targeted stimulation.
Throughout the entire sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale energizes your next precise movement, and every controlled exhale facilitates a smooth transition between the forward push, hip rotations, and lateral shift. If any component of your performance seems off—if a rotation is not perfectly executed or the pressure distribution feels unbalanced—pause, re‑track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is flawless.
