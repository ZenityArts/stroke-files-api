Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Bata Coxa Stroke! I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m truly excited to work with you—an athletic mesomorph with a penis below 5 inches. Your body is finely tuned for agility and precision: your lean and muscular build offers you excellent balance and rapid responsiveness, while your compact extension may be small, it carries intense sensitivity and potential for cumulative stimulation. Today, we’re going to transform your natural athleticism into a meticulously choreographed sequence that leverages every quality you possess to achieve an intimate performance that’s scientifically precise and profoundly satisfying.
Before we begin, find a quiet, comfortable space—a training sanctuary—where you can focus without distractions. Settle into that space, relax your well-defined shoulders, and take several deep, slow breaths to clear your mind and center your thoughts. This moment is all about you and the journey ahead. In our session today, we’re modifying the classic missionary setup to suit your mesomorphic profile. You’ll start in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface. This base is critical; it stabilizes your lean, athletic frame and allows you to execute even the smallest movements with precision.
Once you’re in position, you will insert your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This precise angle is the blueprint for everything that follows in the stroke. Your first movement is a gentle forward push—moving your entire body slowly northward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, the top shelf of your compact penis glides softly over her clitoral region, while the head maintains steady, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is below 5 inches, it is essential that you concentrate most of your energy on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. We achieve this using the 80‑10‑10 principle, which means that approximately 80% of your stimulation is focused on the shallow (typically the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining 20% is divided equally between the mid‑depth (about 3–5 inches) and the deep (beyond 5 inches) zones. This careful distribution ensures that despite having a compact extension, the most sensitive area is stimulated intensely without neglecting the overall balance.
After your forward push, you transition into the lateral phase of the stroke. This is where your natural mesomorphic agility comes into play. You’ll initiate a series of controlled lateral movements using your left hip. Because you have a lean, athletic body, these movements should be quick, precise, and economical. For example, you’ll gently drop your left hip toward the surface—this controlled drop allows the hilt of your penis to apply steady pressure along the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening. At the same time, as your left hip drops, your penis will reorient so that its inner surface points to the right, creating friction and a gentle rocking massage along her right wall. Then you reverse the motion by raising your left hip back toward center, which smoothly shifts the stimulation pattern and resets the forces applied. The alternating, “walking” motion of your hips—tracing out a subtle “W” pattern—is the hallmark of the Bata Coxa Stroke. It builds cumulative stimulation rhythmically and efficiently, tailored to the concentrated, sensitive zones due to your compact extension.
This introduction sets the stage for converting your natural athletic prowess into a scientific, cumulative performance. Our aim is to harness your lean and agile form with precision so that every forward push, lateral drop, and reversal is executed with unwavering control and targeted intensity. Welcome, brother—let’s begin transforming your raw potential into an artful, intimate masterpiece with the Bata Coxa Stroke!
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re diving deep into the core principles that form the backbone of your training for the Bata Coxa Stroke. These elements will provide you with the scientific precision needed to enhance your performance every step of the way.
The 80‑10‑10 principle is the cornerstone of our approach. It instructs you to direct about 80% of your applied force to the shallow vaginal zone, which comprises roughly the first 1 to 3 inches. This zone is packed with nerve endings and is thus the most sensitive. The remaining 20% of your force is divided equally, so that 10% reaches the mid‑depth (about 3–5 inches) and 10% reaches the deep (beyond 5 inches) areas. For you, with a compact extension below 5 inches, this means that every movement must be executed with a laser focus on concentrating the majority of stimulation where it has the most impact—ensuring that you deliver intense, cumulative pleasure without overstimulation beyond that small sensitive area.
Next, we have the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic, iterative method for refining your technique. This process involves four key steps:
First, Define Goal: Clearly articulate what you aim to achieve with your stroke, such as maximizing gentle friction along a specific region of the vaginal wall.
Second, Form Hypothesis: Based on your observations, predict how a slight adjustment—maybe a minor change in the angle or pace of your lateral drop—could enhance the cumulative stimulation.
Third, Track: Methodically perform a high number of repetitions (ideally, at least 30 strokes on each “wall” of the vaginal canal) and record your internal sensations (like the engagement of your core and pelvic floor) as well as your partner’s responses (her breathing patterns, subtle shifts, or quiet verbal feedback).
Fourth, Flow: Once you’ve discovered the stroke variation that yields optimal results, commit to that automatic, rhythmic repetition until every movement is executed seamlessly.
Tracking is all about gathering data during your practice. As you perform each stroke, pay close attention to how your partner responds and how your body feels. This data guides you in determining which parts of your stroke need adjustment. Tracking is critical because it transforms subjective feelings into actionable information that you can use to fine‑tune your technique.
When everything is optimized, you enter a state of flow—where every micro‑movement (from your forward push to your lateral shifts and backward shuttle) occurs automatically and rhythmically. In flow, your stroke becomes a continuous, seamless expression of cumulative stimulation, all while faithfully adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
The tap keystroke is a fundamental drill for perfecting your lateral control. In practice, this drill involves starting in a stable position (like a forearm plank), then shifting laterally until your hip “taps” the supporting surface lightly, before returning smoothly to the center. This controlled, minimal movement trains your lateral muscles and pelvic floor, building the muscle memory needed for those precise lateral drops and raises in the stroke. Coordinating this action with synchronized, deep breathing and kegeling is essential for achieving the exact pressure and rocking motion required.
Combined, these core elements—the strict stimulation distribution of the 80‑10‑10 principle, the systematic refinement of the Sexual Scientific Process with precise tracking and flow, and the essential drill of the tap keystroke—form the foundation upon which you will build your Bata Coxa Stroke. They ensure that every movement is scientifically calibrated to deliver intense, cumulative stimulation exactly where it counts. With these principles firmly in place, you’re now ready to deconstruct the stroke into its individual components.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, it’s time to break down the Bata Coxa Stroke into its fundamental building blocks so that you can master each individual element before integrating them into a seamless, continuous performance. Picture yourself once again in the classic missionary position—on top in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. As an athletic mesomorph with a compact extension below 5 inches, every micro‑movement is crucial in delivering precisely focused, cumulative stimulation. We will isolate each phase so you have a clear, detailed blueprint for executing the stroke.
Forward Movement: The stroke begins by inserting your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. From this starting position, you execute a smooth forward push—moving your entire body steadily northward toward her head. During this phase, the top shelf of your compact penis glides gently over her clitoral area, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push is foundational; it creates the initial stimulation zone and sets the stage by ensuring, per the 80‑10‑10 principle, that approximately 80% of your applied force targets the shallow, most sensitive vaginal zone (roughly the first 1 to 3 inches). Because your extension is below 5 inches, precision in this movement is key: every inch forward must be controlled to concentrate stimulation where it’s most potent.
Lateral Phase (Left Hip Drop): After the forward push, the stroke transitions into the lateral phase. From your forward position, initiate a controlled lateral shift by dropping your left hip toward the canvas. In this movement, the hilt (the base) of your penis applies steady, focused pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right, generating friction and a gentle rocking massage along her right wall. This lateral drop is executed using the tap keystroke—a small, deliberate movement that must be performed with precision, ensuring that the majority of the force is still directed to the shallow, sensitive zone. Given your compact extension, even the slightest deviation in this lateral movement can affect the cumulative stimulation, so each drop must be carefully controlled.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Reversal): Immediately after the lateral drop, raise your left hip back toward the center. In doing so, the hilt shifts its pressure—now from the western section toward the northern section of her vaginal opening—and your penis reorients to point north, producing a gentle upward massage along the northern wall toward the eastern wall. This hip raise is vital for integrating the cumulative stimulation established during the lateral drop, ensuring a smooth transition and maintaining a rhythmic balance in your stroke. Every raise must be executed with the exactness required to preserve the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Cycle Repetition with Variations: The stroke continues with repeated cycles of left hip drops and raises. In some iterations, you may choose to raise your left hip only halfway toward the center at a slightly faster pace, adding a subtle variation in pressure that intensifies the friction and cumulative stimulation. After this rapid half-raise, you then drop once more, and finally complete the cycle by fully raising your left hip back to center, ensuring that your pressure is evenly distributed. This series of controlled variations—each meticulously timed—creates the dynamic “W” pattern central to the Bata Coxa Stroke. It builds cumulative stimulation by targeting the sensitive shallow zone while gently engaging the deeper tissues.
By deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into these distinct phases—forward push, lateral drop using the tap keystroke, controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle—you establish a clear, methodical roadmap for your training. Every element of the movement must be performed with unwavering precision, ensuring that approximately 80% of your applied force is focused on the shallow, sensitive area while the remaining force is distributed evenly to the deeper layers. This detailed breakdown is your blueprint for transforming your raw, natural energy into a refined, cumulative performance that is both scientifically optimized and intimately effective.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each component of the Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as your own breath. With your athletic mesomorph structure and a penis below 5 inches, precision, control, and consistency are absolutely crucial. In this module, we’re going to focus on repetitive, intensive practice of each segmented movement—starting with the forward push, then isolating the lateral drop (via the tap keystroke), followed by controlled hip lowering, and finally the backward shuttle—making sure every repetition adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Forward Movement Drill: Begin by assuming your modified plank position with your knees securely planted on a stable, supportive surface—this anchors your lean, athletic frame. Insert your penis at the precise downward diagonal angle, and then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus intently on the sensations: feel the top shelf of your compact penis glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is small, about 80% of your force must be channeled into the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. Execute this forward push slowly and deliberately, and repeat it several times until you can consistently replicate the motion with smooth, controlled precision.
Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): Next, isolate the lateral component by performing the tap keystroke. From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a small, controlled lateral shift until your hip gently taps the supporting surface. Visualize how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Synchronize each lateral tap with deep, controlled breathing: inhale deeply before initiating the shift and exhale slowly as you complete the tap. For enhanced precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each lateral movement. Drill this lateral tap repeatedly—aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side—until the tap keystroke becomes an ingrained, automatic part of your muscle memory.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: After mastering the lateral tap, focus on the lowering phase. Following each lateral tap, slowly lower your dropped hip until it gently contacts the supporting surface, maintaining control at every step. Concentrate on how the underbelly of your penis begins to apply a gentle, cumulative pressure against her lower wall while the upper shelf remains in consistent contact with her upper wall. Then, practice a slow, deliberate backward shuttle—retract your body in a controlled manner so that your penis stays in continuous contact with her north wall as you reset your position without fully withdrawing. Repeat the full sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times until every transition is smooth and every micro‑movement is executed perfectly according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout your drilling session, maintain deep, deliberate breathing. Let each deep inhale sharpen your focus and prepare you for the next micro‑movement, while every controlled exhale guarantees a smooth transition between phases. With disciplined, repetitive practice, your natural mesomorphic agility and compact extension will merge into a series of movements that are executed with unwavering precision and cumulative intensity.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now it’s time, brother, to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—this is where the art of the Bata Coxa Stroke truly emerges. Return to your starting position in your modified plank, with your knees firmly planted, your core engaged, and your mind solely focused on creating a fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this module, you will merge your forward push, lateral taps (performed via the tap keystroke), controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle into one unified, rhythmic cycle that forms the distinctive “W” pattern of the stroke.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward—moving steadily north toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your compact penis consistently glides over her clitoral region, and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push lays the foundation for cumulative stimulation and must strictly follow the 80‑10‑10 principle, allocating about 80% of your applied force to the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase. Execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip using the tap keystroke. With each lateral tap, focus intently on how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Once these lateral taps are completed, gradually lower your dropped hip so that the underbelly of your penis maintains steady, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf sustains continuous contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a smooth, deliberate backward shuttle until you return to your starting position, ensuring that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall throughout the retraction.
After you complete one full cycle on one side, reset and mirror the entire sequence on the opposite side. Now, raise your right hip laterally and perform three deliberate lateral taps—with the right side of your penis engaging the left vaginal opening and the left side providing a complementary, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall—then lower your hip in a controlled manner and shuttle backward until you return to your original starting position. This alternating “walking” motion of your hips creates the rhythmic “W” pattern that is the hallmark of the Bata Coxa Stroke, ensuring that cumulative stimulation is delivered evenly in strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated sequence, let your deep, rhythmic breathing serve as your internal metronome: inhale deeply before each phase to prepare your body, and exhale steadily to ensure smooth transitions between every micro‑movement. With each complete cycle, your natural mesomorphic precision and compact extension will converge into a continuous, fluid performance—a Bata Coxa Stroke that is both scientifically refined and intimately satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our focus is on fine‑tuning every micro‑adjustment of your Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every movement must be executed with impeccable precision to maintain the 80‑10‑10 principle. That means approximately 80% of your applied force should be concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone, with the remaining force evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep areas.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, observe every nuance of your performance. During the forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your compact penis consistently glides over her clitoral region while the head maintains continuous, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you execute your lateral taps using the tap keystroke, pay close attention to the subtle, natural rocking motion produced by your controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even the slightest change in your lateral angle can have a significant impact on cumulative stimulation. Experiment with minor adjustments—a slight change in the degree of your hip drop, for example—and carefully monitor how these modifications affect the pressure distribution and the rocking effect. Use your partner’s feedback—her deep, steady breathing, soft verbal cues, and any slight physical adjustments—as valuable data points. This iterative process—defining your objective, hypothesizing a small modification, meticulously tracking the outcome, and refining your technique—is the essence of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout every cycle. Each deep inhale should focus your energy and prepare your body for the upcoming micro‑movement, while every controlled exhale facilitates smooth, natural transitions between phases. Over time, as you continuously track your internal sensations (like core engagement and pelvic floor contraction) along with your partner’s responses, you will eventually reach a state of flow—a state where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed seamlessly and automatically. When you achieve this flow, your Bata Coxa Stroke will become a continuous, rhythmic expression of scientifically optimized, cumulative stimulation that perfectly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Remember, brother, that every tiny adjustment counts. Your athletic mesomorph build and moderate extension provide you with the ideal foundation to deliver intensely focused stimulation—but only with perfect consistency and precision in every micro‑movement. Keep tracking your internal cues and your partner’s feedback; this will allow you to refine your technique continuously until your stroke evolves into a naturally flowing performance that is both scientifically precise and deeply intimate.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to create your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen designed to reinforce every element of the Bata Coxa Stroke while also strengthening the core and overall stability essential for your athletic mesomorph build with a penis size between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your comprehensive roadmap for transforming your natural physical prowess into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically calibrated stimulation.
Begin by establishing your own dedicated training space—a quiet, private area where distractions are minimized and your focus is entirely on honing your technique. Each training session should start with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically for your mesomorph physique. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back—these areas provide the vital support needed for every precise micro‑movement during the Bata Coxa Stroke. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the intricate work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for your session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target each component of the stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees firmly planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis between 5 and 7 inches, each lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface and then return smoothly to center. Synchronize every movement with deep, deliberate breathing—inhaling deeply before initiating the lateral shift and exhaling slowly as you complete the tap. For enhanced precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor with each lateral tap. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke becomes completely ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve mastered the lateral tap, integrate it with the vertical movements. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and then a smooth, gradual backward shuttle—ensuring that every micro‑movement strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this full integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition flows seamlessly. To further improve your stability and precision, supplement your stroke‑specific drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises—such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills—because a strong core is essential to maintaining both balance and exact control during the Bata Coxa Stroke. Keep a detailed training journal where you record every session—note the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you experiment with, and your partner’s feedback. This journal is an indispensable tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, allowing you to track your progress and continuously refine your performance.
Your personalized practice routine is your blueprint for mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a performance that’s fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of your disciplined practice, where your athletic mesomorph build and your penis size between 5 and 7 inches converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly on a stable surface, core engaged, and your mind entirely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, make sure that the top shelf of your penis consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward drive must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle—roughly 80% of your force is directed to the shallow, sensitive zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your right hip. Raise your hip in a small, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps. With each tap, focus intently on ensuring that the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. If any lateral tap appears inconsistent—whether due to uneven pressure or a slight misalignment in your lateral angle—pause and isolate that specific movement. Drill it repeatedly until both your internal signals and your partner’s subtle feedback confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, focus on the contraction of your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor, and listen carefully to any subtle cues from your partner—her measured breaths or slight shifts in posture can indicate whether adjustments are needed. This troubleshooting stage is critical; if the cumulative stimulation isn’t optimal, make small modifications—perhaps a slight tweak in your lateral angle or a change in the pace of your forward push—and track the outcomes carefully using the iterative cycle of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as a unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation throughout the entire vaginal canal. Achieving a state of flow—where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the pinnacle of your training. When you reach that state, your Bata Coxa Stroke will stand as a testament to your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate precision—a continuous, fluid performance that is both scientifically refined and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements turn your dedicated practice into an art form—a performance in which every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your athletic mesomorph strength and balanced extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure in every movement. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Bata Coxa Stroke bring you ever closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
