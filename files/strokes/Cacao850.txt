Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformative journey with the Cacao Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to work with you—a strong, full‑figured endomorph blessed with an extension above 7 inches. Your powerful, robust body is built for endurance and raw force; you have a rock-solid, stable frame that provides a superb base for every move. With your extended asset, you have a remarkable range that, when harnessed correctly, can deliver intensely focused, cumulative stimulation in a way that’s uniquely yours. Today, we’re going to take that inherent power and convert it into a precise, rhythmic performance that merges scientific technique with intimate finesse.
Imagine stepping into your personal training space—a quiet sanctuary where you can set aside all distractions and focus solely on building your mastery. Take a moment to settle in, relax your broad, steady shoulders, and take several deep, slow breaths. Let your mind clear, preparing to dedicate yourself entirely to the process at hand. In this session, we modify the classic missionary position to perfectly accommodate your endomorphic structure. You begin by assuming a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface. This position is vital because it anchors your heavy‑set frame, ensuring that every micro‑movement is executed with deliberate control and precision. Your body, with its natural mass, requires controlled motions so that your immense strength is directed exactly where it’s needed without overwhelming the delicate sensitivity of your partner’s anatomy.
Once you’re firmly in position, you insert your penis at a precisely controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This isn’t random placement—it is your blueprint, a carefully calculated alignment that sets the stage for every movement to follow. Your stroke begins with a smooth, deliberate forward push. As you gradually move your entire body forward towards your partner’s head, the top shelf of your extended asset glides effortlessly over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, purposeful contact with her “south wall.” In your case, with an extension above 7 inches, it’s critical that you channel approximately 80% of your applied force into the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone (the first 1–3 inches), as this is where sensitivity peaks. The remaining 20% is evenly distributed between the mid‑depth and deep areas. This is the essence of the 80‑10‑10 principle, which ensures that every forward push is focused precisely for maximum stimulation.
After the forward push, the Cacao Stroke unfolds into its signature full‑body phase. Your stroke is characterized by a series of coordinated movements that harness your entire physique: two slow stirs to one side, followed by two slow hip rotations, and finally a leg raise as you shuttle your body forward. Because you are an endomorph, your natural strength and stability allow you to generate powerful yet controlled movements. However, you must remain mindful that your robust build can deliver overwhelming force if not precisely managed, especially with an extension that stretches beyond 7 inches. That’s why every micro‑movement—every stir, every rotation, and every leg raise—is executed slowly and deliberately, ensuring that your force is distributed in perfect harmony with the sensitive shallow zone while gently engaging the deeper tissues.
The “douplo” component of this stroke means that after you complete the entire sequence on one side, you mirror that exact sequence on the opposite side. This dual‑phase approach ensures that both halves of the vaginal canal receive balanced, cumulative stimulation. Every forward push, every stir, every hip rotation, and every leg raise builds layer upon layer of focused pleasure. In this introduction, you’re laying the foundation to transform your raw, endomorphic power into a refined technique that is both scientifically precise and deeply satisfying. Welcome, brother—let’s begin turning your immense potential into a masterful expression of intimate control with the Cacao Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke Alright, brother, now that you’ve set the stage in your training space, let’s dive into the core principles that underlie your technique. These concepts form the backbone of the Cacao Stroke and ensure that every movement is executed with precision and cumulative effectiveness.
First up is the 80‑10‑10 principle. Think of it as your force distribution roadmap. It instructs you to concentrate about 80% of your applied force on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—where nerve endings are the densest and sensitivity is at its highest. The remaining 20% of your force must be split evenly, with 10% targeting the mid‑depth region (approximately 3–5 inches) and 10% going to the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an endomorph with an extension above 7 inches, this balanced approach is critical. You have the raw power and mass to generate a lot of force, so it’s essential to direct most of it to the most sensitive area while still gently engaging the deeper layers. This measured distribution prevents overstimulation of one area and ensures that the cumulative effect is focused and highly effective.
Now, let’s talk about the Sexual Scientific Process. This process is our systematic method of refining your technique through constant feedback and adjustment. It begins with defining your goal. For example, you might set an objective to maximize the friction delivered during your stir movements. Once your goal is clear, you form a hypothesis—perhaps you believe that a slightly slower pace during the stirs will increase the cumulative effect or that adjusting the angle of your hip rotation will bring more pleasure. Then comes tracking, which is a vital step. Here, you perform your stroke repeatedly—ideally about 30 strokes on each “wall” of your partner’s vaginal canal—and carefully observe her responses. Tracking is primarily about finding out exactly which areas she enjoys being massaged most on that particular day. You note her breathing, slight shifts in her body, and any verbal cues she gives, and you pay close attention to how your body feels—ensuring your core is engaged and your pelvic floor is working in unison. That real-time feedback is invaluable as it tells you where to focus your force for maximum cumulative stimulation.
Once you gather enough feedback from tracking, you then enter a state of flow. Flow is when your stroke becomes automatic and perfectly rhythmic—when every forward push, every lateral stir, every hip rotation and leg raise happens seamlessly without you having to consciously think about it. In flow, you are consistently massaging that specific area she loves the most, with the perfect pressure and pace that you’ve identified during tracking. The beauty of reaching flow is that she can concentrate fully on the sensation, and that focused, consistent stimulation is what ultimately brings her to climax.
Last but not least, we have the tap keystroke—a critical drill for honing your lateral control. Imagine yourself in a steady forearm plank. You then shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface before returning smoothly to center. Although it’s a small and seemingly simple movement, it is absolutely essential. This drill builds the muscle memory and strengthens your pelvic floor, ensuring that every lateral shift in your stroke is executed with pinpoint accuracy. When practiced with synchronized deep breathing (what we call stroke breathing) and kegeling exercises, the tap keystroke drill becomes the backbone of your lateral movement. It guarantees that every sideways motion is controlled, precise, and perfectly aligned with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
To sum it up, the 80‑10‑10 principle instructs you to devote roughly 80% of your force to the shallow, most nerve‑rich zone while balancing the remaining force between the mid‑depth and deep areas. The Sexual Scientific Process helps you refine your stroke by defining your goal, forming a hypothesis, tracking her feedback to pinpoint her sweet spots, and then entering a state of seamless flow. And the tap keystroke drill ensures that your lateral movements are executed with surgical precision. Together, these components form the foundational framework that will allow you to perform the Cacao Stroke with scientific precision and cumulative intensity. With these principles firmly ingrained, you’re ready to break down the stroke into its fundamental components.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Cacao Stroke into Its Fundamental Components Alright, brother, let’s break down the Cacao Stroke into every single movement so you have a crystal‑clear blueprint. This stroke is crafted specifically for ectomorphs with an extension between 5 and 7 inches, blending full‑body dynamics with targeted, cumulative stimulation. The stroke is executed in two halves—the right‑side sequence followed by an exact mirror on the left—to ensure balanced stimulation across the vaginal canal.
You start in your modified missionary position, with your knees firmly planted on the canvas and your penis inserted at a precisely controlled downward diagonal angle. This initial setup is your blueprint. It sets the stage for everything that follows, dictating the angles, force distribution, and pressure points according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Your stroke begins with a deliberate forward push. Slowly, you move your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. During this push, the top shelf of your extension glides gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head stays in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” In this phase, roughly 80% of your force is focused on the shallow zone—the most sensitive area—ensuring that maximum stimulation is delivered. The remaining 20% is distributed evenly to gently engage the mid‑depth and deep zones. This forward push sets up a foundation of deep, cumulative pleasure.
Immediately after the forward push, you transition into the lateral phase on the right. For the right‑side sequence, you perform two slow stir movements to the right. In these stirs, envision your body drawing a perfect circle on the z‑axis from your belly button, as if a pencil were extending from your midline and drawing an elegant circle on the ground. As you move in this circle, the hilt of your penis canvases the entire perimeter of her vaginal opening, applying gentle, cumulative pressure to each segment. These stirs ensure that even as you move, your force remains concentrated on the shallow zone, building cumulative stimulation with every controlled rotation.
Following the stirs, you then move into two slow, controlled hip rotations to the right. As you execute these rotations, your hips move in a measured arc, and the hilt shifts its pressure along her vaginal opening—from the northwestern segment gradually to the southwestern portion. Meanwhile, your penis reorients so that the head points toward the southeastern wall and then gradually shifts upward to massage the northeastern wall. These hip rotations are executed with precision to modulate the force without losing the focus of stimulation on the shallow zone.
After completing the hip rotations, you incorporate a right leg raise as you shuttle your body forward toward your partner’s head. As your right leg lifts slowly, your body continues its forward motion, and the hilt applies additional targeted pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening. At the same time, your penis, now slightly reoriented, creates focused friction against her northwestern wall. This leg raise combined with the forward shuttle adds a dynamic element, ensuring that cumulative stimulation builds with every measured repetition.
Once you have completed the entire right‑side sequence—forward push, stirs, hip rotations, and leg raise—you then mirror the same series of movements on the left side. For the left side, you again start with a forward push that adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle, then perform two slow stirs to the left, letting your body draw a circular motion that canvases her vaginal opening with gentle pressure. Next, you carry out two slow, controlled hip rotations to the left, where the hilt shifts pressure from the northeastern segment to the southeastern segment, with your penis adjusting to massage the opposite wall. Finally, you execute a left leg raise as you shuttle forward, ensuring targeted friction along the left side. This mirroring creates a rhythmic “W” pattern, delivering balanced, cumulative stimulation to both halves of her vaginal canal.
This complete deconstruction offers you a step‑by‑step roadmap for every micro‑movement in the Cacao Stroke. Every forward push, every stir, every hip rotation, and every leg raise is precisely calibrated according to the 80‑10‑10 principle to maximize stimulation in the shallow zone while gently engaging the deeper layers. With this detailed blueprint in hand, you’re fully equipped to drill each element and eventually integrate them into a fluid, continuous performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention Alright, brother, it’s time to drill every single component of the Cacao Stroke until the movements are as natural as your own breath. With your ectomorphic build and a moderate extension between 5 and 7 inches, precision and repetition are key to building perfect muscle memory and control. In this module, we’ll work on each segment individually and then gradually combine them into a seamless routine—all while strictly adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Start with the forward push drill. Settle into your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a sturdy, supportive surface. Insert your penis at the carefully calculated downward diagonal angle, and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus intensely on the sensation as the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region and the head maintains deliberate, uninterrupted contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is moderate in length, about 80% of your force should be concentrated on the shallow, sensitive vaginal zone. Repeat this forward push slowly and deliberately, ensuring that every repetition is executed with smooth, controlled precision until you feel the motion become second nature.
Next, move on to your right‑side lateral drills. Begin by performing two slow, deliberate stirs to the right. Visualize your body drawing a perfect circle around your belly button—as if you were drawing with a pencil on the floor. As you move in this circular motion, feel the hilt of your penis actively canvassing the entire perimeter of her vaginal opening, applying a gentle, cumulative pressure to each segment. Maintain deep, steady breathing throughout each stir, and practice until the motion is completely ingrained.
After perfecting the stirs, transition to the hip rotation drill on the right. Slowly execute two controlled hip rotations, focusing on the hilt’s pressure shifting from the northwestern segment to the southwestern segment of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, allow your penis to reorient so that the head gradually points toward the southeastern wall and moves upward to massage the northeastern wall. Repeat these rotations until you can perform them with a smooth, rhythmic cadence while maintaining the 80‑10‑10 force distribution.
Then, work on the right leg raise combined with the forward shuttle. As you execute a slow forward push, gradually lift your right leg until your knee is raised and your body shuttles forward toward her head. Focus on the sensation as the hilt applies additional, targeted pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis adjusts its angle to create consistent friction on her northwestern wall. Drill this sequence repeatedly until you can perform the leg raise and shuttle with the same fluid, controlled timing as the stirs and hip rotations.
Once you’ve honed the right‑side movements, mirror the drills on the left side. Practice two slow stirs to the left, then two controlled hip rotations to the left, and finally a left leg raise with forward shuttle. Repeat each drill at least 30 times until the motions on both sides become ingrained in your muscle memory. Throughout every repetition, keep your breathing deep and deliberate—each inhale primes you for the next movement, and every exhale ensures seamless transitions. With disciplined practice, your ectomorphic agility and moderate extension will merge into a set of precise, cumulative motions that define the Cacao Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to bring it all together into one seamless, continuous performance—the complete Cacao Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your mind laser‑focused on integrating every movement. In this integrated cycle, you will combine your forward push with the right‑side sequence (two stirs, two hip rotations, and a right leg raise with a forward shuttle) and immediately mirror the same sequence on the left side, creating a rhythmic “W” pattern that delivers balanced cumulative stimulation across the entire vaginal canal.
Begin with the forward push: insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides effortlessly over her clitoral region and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push sets the foundation and is executed according to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with about 80% of your force focused on the shallow, most sensitive area.
Immediately transition into your right‑side sequence. Execute two slow, deliberate stirs to the right, visualizing your body drawing perfect circles on the z‑axis from your belly button. Feel the hilt canvassing her vaginal opening with gentle, cumulative pressure as you complete each stir. Next, perform two controlled hip rotations to the right, where the hilt’s pressure shifts gradually from the northwestern to the southwestern segment, while your penis reorients to produce a subtle upward massage. Then, incorporate the right leg raise and forward shuttle—lifting your right leg slowly while shuttling forward toward her head, ensuring that additional targeted pressure is applied along her right side. Once you’ve completed the right‑side sequence, reset quickly and mirror the identical sequence on the left side: a forward push, followed by two slow stirs to the left, two controlled hip rotations to the left, and a left leg raise with forward shuttle. The mirror image creates a rhythmic “W” pattern that ensures both sides are stimulated equally and cumulatively.
Throughout the integrated sequence, your deep, rhythmic breathing acts as your internal metronome. Every deep inhale primes your body for the next movement, and every controlled exhale enables smooth transitions between movements. With each complete cycle, your entire Cacao Stroke becomes a fluid, continuous performance that adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, delivering targeted stimulation in perfect harmony.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where we fine‑tune every micro‑adjustment of your Cacao Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your endomorphic build—robust and full‑figured—and your moderate extension between 5 and 7 inches, every movement must be executed with pinpoint precision. The 80‑10‑10 principle is your guide: 80% of your force goes to the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is distributed evenly between the mid‑depth and deep areas.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, pay close attention to each sensation. During the forward push, verify that the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region, and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, during the stirs, hip rotations, and leg raises, be mindful of the subtle rocking and cumulative effects produced by your controlled lateral movements. Tracking is critical here—it’s your method of gathering real-time feedback from both your own body and your partner. As you perform about 30 repetitions along each wall, focus not only on how stable your core and pelvic floor feel but also on which exact movements elicit her most pleasurable reactions. Tracking is essentially your way of discovering her sweet spots in that very moment—those specific areas where the stimulation is most intense.
Once you’ve gathered enough feedback through tracking, you’ll eventually enter a state of flow. Flow is that magical condition where every forward push, every stir, every hip rotation, and every leg raise occurs seamlessly and automatically. In flow, you consistently and continuously massage her preferred spots with the ideal pressure and pace, allowing her to concentrate fully on the sensations that drive her to climax. Your deep, rhythmic breathing is crucial during this phase—each inhalation preps your body for the next movement, and each exhalation smooths the transition.
Throughout your practice, the tap keystroke drill remains an essential component. This drill, where you shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface and then return smoothly to center, builds the muscle memory and pelvic strength needed to execute every lateral move with precision. When integrated with synchronized deep breathing and kegeling, it ensures that every lateral shift is as precise as possible, reinforcing your ability to adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Ultimately, this advanced phase is about constant refinement. By tracking every tiny detail—the firmness of your core, the engagement of your pelvic floor, and her exact responses—you can make slight adjustments that bring your stroke closer to perfection. As you evolve your technique, you’ll find that your Cacao Stroke flows naturally, delivering cumulative, focused stimulation that drives her steadily toward climax.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a disciplined training regimen that not only reinforces every element of your Cacao Stroke but also builds the core and overall stability essential for your robust endomorphic physique and moderate extension. This routine is your roadmap to transforming your natural power into a flawless, repeatable performance that delivers optimal, cumulative stimulation.
Start by establishing your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are minimized and your focus is entirely on your technique. In this space, every session begins with an extensive warm‑up specifically designed for your full‑figured endomorphic build. Engage in dynamic stretching that targets your core, hips, and lower back; these muscle groups are the foundation of your stability and control. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the rigorous work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a positive intention for the session.
Next, move into specialized drills that hone each individual component of the stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees planted firmly on a solid surface—practice controlled lateral taps. With your compact extension in the 5 to 7‑inch range, each lateral shift must be executed with pinpoint precision. Focus on gently shifting your body until your hip lightly taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Synchronize every movement with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale deeply before each shift, and exhale slowly afterward. Incorporate kegeling exercises to further strengthen your pelvic floor and hone your control. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the movement becomes ingrained.
Once you’ve mastered the tap keystroke, integrate it with the forward push and lateral components. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, followed immediately by your series of lateral taps and a smooth backward shuttle. Maintain strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle throughout, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force targets the shallow, sensitive zone. Drill this integrated sequence repeatedly until every transition is smooth and the entire stroke becomes second nature.
To further bolster your performance, supplement your drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills. A strong core is non-negotiable—it anchors every micro‑movement and ensures your overall precision and balance. Finally, maintain a detailed training journal. Record every session—note the number of repetitions, document any slight adjustments you experiment with, and capture her feedback. This journal is an invaluable tool as part of the Sexual Scientific Process, guiding your continuous refinement and ensuring that every bit of feedback is used to fine‑tune your technique.
Your personalized practice routine is your cornerstone, brother. With dedicated, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural, robust endomorphic power and moderate extension into a flawless performance—a Cacao Stroke that is fluid, scientifically optimized, and deeply satisfying for both you and your partner.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—the moment where every drilled component of the Cacao Stroke merges into one seamless, continuous performance and every slight imperfection is refined until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of all your disciplined practice, where your powerful, full‑figured endomorphic frame and moderate extension combine in a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank, with your knees firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface, your core engaged, and your mind honed for precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must follow the 80‑10‑10 principle rigorously, directing about 80% of your force to the shallow, nerve‑rich zone, while the remaining 20% is carefully balanced to engage the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase on one side by performing the tap keystroke with your chosen hip. Drop your hip in a small, deliberate lateral shift until it gently taps the supporting surface, then return smoothly to center. Focus intently on how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening, and watch as your penis rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. If any lateral tap feels inconsistent—if the pressure is uneven or the angle seems off—pause, isolate that movement, and drill it repeatedly until your internal feedback and her subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to collect precise internal feedback. As you perform the pushout, focus on contracting your core and engaging your pelvic floor. Listen closely for her responses—her steady, deep breathing or soft verbal cues will indicate whether each element is perfectly calibrated. If you notice that the cumulative stimulation isn’t quite where it needs to be, make slight, mindful adjustments—perhaps a minor tweak in your lateral angle or a subtle change in the pace of your forward push—and track your outcomes rigorously using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re confident that every adjustment is fine‑tuned, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every movement flows seamlessly as a unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror this complete cycle on the opposite side, ensuring balanced, cumulative stimulation throughout her entire vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where each micro‑movement occurs automatically, with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal. When you reach that state, your Cacao Stroke will be a continuous, fluid performance that not only adheres rigorously to the 80‑10‑10 principle but also delivers the exact, focused stimulation that leads her effortlessly to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your disciplined training into a true work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every stir, every hip rotation, and every leg raise is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your robust, full‑figured endomorphic strength and moderate extension will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Cacao Stroke that delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure every single time. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother, and let every flawless cycle of your Cacao Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery
