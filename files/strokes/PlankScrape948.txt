Module 1 teaches how to build the plank posture for the Plank Scrape—your foundation for pressure, angle, and rhythm control. The posture must distribute load evenly through the shoulders, core, and hips, allowing the stroke to form from torque, not brute force. Start by lowering into a forearm-plank on a soft but stable surface. Elbows align directly beneath the shoulders, forearms parallel, hands relaxed. Inhale through the nose, tightening the abdomen as if bracing for a light punch, then exhale slowly and feel the pelvis level. The hips should hover in a straight line with the spine, neither sagging nor arched. This neutral baseline is where every movement begins and ends. Think of it as the “home frequency” that keeps your control sharp and your pressure predictable.
From this neutral plank, explore the feeling of balance between your core and hips. Rock slightly forward and back—Light pressure only—to learn where your center of gravity rests. When forward, the pelvic bone tips down, and when back, the glutes engage slightly. This is how you sense the difference between Rocking and Angling before any real stroke begins. Inhale as you tip forward, exhale as you draw back. Your breathing and your pelvis must move as one, a loop of effort and release. The moment your exhale ends, your hips should float in stillness—the resting point that tells you you’ve found the neutral reset position.
Next, engage the shallow zone of your range, the 80% of depth that forms the Plank Scrape’s core. Because your length is below five inches, staying shallow allows maximum wall contact without collapsing her interior tension. The goal isn’t depth; it’s consistent pressure along the same surface. Inhale to prepare, then exhale as you lower your hips just enough to feel weight transfer into your thighs and abdomen. You should feel your shaft pressing lightly into one wall—no more than Medium pressure. That’s the zone where nerve mapping happens. She’ll feel warmth, not intrusion. Watch for her breath deepening or a subtle pelvic lift; those are the signs your pressure is aligned.
Mesomorph structure brings symmetry and power but can also create excess torque if not checked. Keep shoulders quiet and let the core do the work. The motion source must always come from your lower abdomen, never your back. If your shoulders start to sway or elbows shift outward, reset to neutral immediately. Each reset is a breath—inhale, align, exhale, settle. Practicing these resets between short motion sets prevents strain and builds rhythm reliability. Over time, the body learns to self-correct mid-stroke without thought.
Finally, check your wall clarity. From plank, lean slightly left until you feel the right wall’s friction. Return to neutral, then lean right to feel the left wall. Keep the angle shallow, around twenty degrees, and always exhale through the lean. Each wall will feel subtly different; your task is to memorize the response of her hips and breath to each side. This sensitivity training is the reason plank orientation matters—it teaches how to move from stillness, not from guessing.
To protect joints, distribute load evenly across forearms and toes, never the wrists. Keep the neck neutral and gaze slightly ahead of your hands. After each one-minute cycle, rest on your knees, roll your shoulders back, and breathe three times through the diaphragm to discharge tension. A simple journal entry might read, “Left lean, shallow, Medium pressure, hips aligned at rep six.” Each note locks a sensory memory for future modules.
The Plank Scrape starts with orientation to posture. Your goal in this module is to build a forearm-plank foundation that lets the stroke happen with precision, not force. Start in a firm forearm plank, elbows under shoulders, hips level, spine neutral. Imagine your body as a bridge—solid at both ends, light in the middle. The stability must come from your core, not your shoulders or lower back. For a mesomorph, strength comes naturally but tension can collect fast; your job is to hold the line, not to flex through it. Keep your breath long and smooth, inhaling through the nose to expand the ribs, exhaling through the mouth to soften the lower abdomen. This breath rhythm is your pressure dial.
Drop your focus to the pelvis. The Plank Scrape uses a low, gliding motion—Rocking, not Angling. Your hips slide slightly forward and back across the compass line of the north wall, maintaining light to medium pressure through the shallow 80% of your depth zone. Because your size is below five inches, this shallowness is your advantage. You will feel more wall feedback and can stay in contact without bottoming out. Think of the motion like sharpening a blade on a stone—steady, rhythmic, no jabs. Every forward glide is an exhale; every backward reset, an inhale. The motion should feel smooth, like the pelvis is tracing the inside of a curve rather than pushing into it.
To test the alignment, pause every five cycles at neutral. Neutral means hips square, weight evenly balanced, abs engaged, no forward drive. From this position, notice whether your shoulders begin to sag or your glutes tighten too early. Reset by drawing your belly in slightly and pressing your forearms into the ground until you feel the core take the load again. This is your joint protection. For mesomorphs, the hips tend to dominate—so remind your upper body to carry part of the tension. Keep the neck relaxed. The power should live between sternum and pubic bone, not in the traps or thighs.
Now focus on the scrape quality. The motion should skim, not punch. The glans should feel like it’s brushing a low shelf—the anterior wall’s inner edge—without lifting out or breaking rhythm. The pressure remains light to medium, never hard. You’ll know it’s right when imaginary feedback from her body would feel like suction on the forward exhale and gentle slide-back release on the inhale. If this were live, her breath would deepen and hips might subtly curl toward you; those are your tracking cues for future modules. For now, just visualize that connection while staying disciplined in your rhythm.
Finish each practice set by holding neutral for three breaths. Let your body settle. Notice the warmth in your abdomen and the length in your spine. That heat means blood flow is building along your pelvic line—your nervous system is learning to differentiate tension from control. Journal it in shorthand as: “N@5 → light scrape, stable hips, breath matched.” This will help you recall the state later during Tracking.

========================================================================================
The Plank Scrape’s keystrokes are the foundation of its rhythm. You’ll train them like scales on an instrument—each movement clean and distinct before chaining them together later. The first keystroke is the Core Rock. From your forearm-plank baseline, exhale and shift the hips forward a finger’s width, letting the pelvis glide toward the north wall. The motion comes from the abs contracting, not the legs. Keep the spine neutral and eyes down. As you inhale, rock back to baseline, keeping the glans in light contact with the wall plane. This Rocking motion should stay inside the shallow 80%—a pressure band of light to medium—and build a feeling of traction, not thrust. The breath is your metronome: one breath per full rock.
The second keystroke is the Scrape Draw. From the same plank, exhale and subtly angle the hips down by rotating the tailbone a few degrees toward the floor. This shifts contact from the anterior ridge to the undercurve, engaging the ventral side. Then, on the inhale, release back to neutral. This movement adds an Angling quality to the stroke—small, deliberate, smooth. Because your size is below five inches, this scrape engages more sensory area along the top and underside without losing rhythm. Keep the motion contained to a fingertip of travel. You’re teaching your pelvis to make micro-adjustments while staying grounded through the core.
The third keystroke is the Anchor Reset. Every five to seven Rock + Scrape cycles, inhale and drive the forearms gently into the floor, locking the ribs down and bringing the hips fully back to baseline. This creates a moment of stillness where the core takes the load and all lower muscles reset. For mesomorphs, who tend to overdrive power from the hips, this reset prevents burnout and keeps the nervous system sharp. Think of it as a heartbeat of stillness between movements.
When practiced together, the Core Rock builds forward drive, the Scrape Draw adds contour control, and the Anchor Reset keeps rhythm integrity. You’ll begin to feel how they feed each other—the rock pulling, the scrape refining, the reset rebalancing. Each breath cycle teaches your system to distinguish between pressure, motion, and grounding. Because your leverage is shorter, stay faithful to the 80% shallow plane and let repetition deepen sensation instead of distance. Over time, this creates finer wall discrimination and higher endurance without fatigue.
End your practice with a three-breath neutral hold. Feel the abdominal tone and subtle heat along your pelvic seam. Record your entry as: “R/S@10 → stable, smooth, no bounce.” That shorthand locks in the learning phase.

========================================================================================
Now that your body understands each keystroke, you’ll combine them into a single, flowing rhythm. The Plank Scrape’s full sequence feels like a pulse through the hips rather than a thrust. Begin from your neutral forearm-plank. Inhale deeply to anchor, ribs expanding sideways, spine long. As you exhale, let the Core Rock pull you forward a finger’s width, the glans brushing the north wall in that shallow 80% zone. Keep the pelvis level and the abs tight enough to guide the motion rather than force it. Without pausing, transition into the Scrape Draw by rotating the tailbone slightly downward, tracing the undercurve of the wall as you maintain contact. On the next inhale, pull back through the Anchor Reset, bringing the hips home to baseline. That full sequence—forward rock, downward scrape, anchored reset—forms one complete stroke.
The rhythm should feel like a triangle drawn through space. The forward rock is one edge, the scrape down another, and the reset the third. Each edge gets one breath: exhale through the forward glide, inhale through the scrape return, hold a soft pause at the neutral reset. The timing should be slow enough that your body can sense the shift of pressure from the anterior ridge to the ventral line and back. When you link cycles, aim for five continuous sequences before resting in neutral. Keep pressure light to medium; anything heavier breaks rhythm and burns endurance too soon. Mesomorph frames can overengage hip flexors—counter this by spreading the effort through the abs and upper thighs so you stay smooth instead of jerky.
If you feel tension building in the shoulders, press the forearms down and slightly forward, letting the chest lengthen. That tension release should happen before restarting. This movement pattern teaches your nervous system to rely on stability, not power, to create sensation. Because your size is below five inches, focus on staying glued to the wall rather than diving for depth. Each scrape should feel like your body polishing a narrow groove—steady, friction-rich, rhythmic. Over many repetitions, that control will give you micro-pressure mastery that deeper strokes can’t match.
End each set by returning to full neutral and breathing three times through the nose. Let the abs soften and the pelvic floor release. You should feel warmth in the lower belly and a kind of elastic recoil under the skin, the sign that your body is learning to cycle power and rest within a single motion. Journal in shorthand: “PS chain@5 → stable groove, smooth reset, no hip fatigue.” That’s your checkpoint before the Tracking phase begins.

========================================================================================
Now you begin the Tracking phase—where movement becomes measurement. You’re not chasing sensation; you’re collecting data through feel. The Plank Scrape will now run entirely within the shallow 80%, because that’s where your wall clarity and control are sharpest. Begin in forearm-plank, breathe deep into the ribs, exhale and glide forward through your Core Rock. Hold that light to medium pressure and notice exactly where the contact is strongest. Is it high on the ridge or lower under the curve? That point of maximum feedback is your reference mark. Stay on that same line for five slow strokes, exhaling forward, inhaling back to neutral.
Each set is a small experiment—your SSP in motion. Define what you’re testing: maybe angle, pressure, or breath rhythm. For example, you might hypothesize that a slightly slower exhale produces smoother wall traction. Run five controlled cycles to test it, then pause at neutral and observe the internal difference. Does the glide feel more continuous, or does friction fade? Track the outcome by noting it in shorthand, like “N→S slow exhale = steadier wall feel.” Then refine and retest. This loop—define, test, observe, refine—is the Tracking discipline.
As you work, your breath and motion should begin to merge into one unbroken pulse. The motion should feel like a steady hum, not a repetition of effort. Each forward rock is a small promise; each return to neutral, a moment of truth. Mesomorph builds can trick the mind into pushing harder when feedback fades, but restraint is your mastery. Keep pressure below the urge threshold—light enough that the wall feels like a living surface, not an obstacle. Because your size is below five inches, you’ll sense the wall’s microtextures more clearly. Use that advantage to map which direction—slightly north-northeast or north-northwest—gives the richest feedback.
Your body will start giving subtle cues. When alignment is right, your breath stays even and heat pools behind the pubic bone instead of in the thighs. If it drifts, your shoulders tense or the glans loses consistent traction. Every ten strokes, reset at neutral, draw one full breath, and let the core soften before resuming. This rhythm of testing, noting, and resting builds precision. You’re training awareness like a craftsman feeling grain through sandpaper. The better your sensory map, the more refined your later flow will be.
Finish by lying flat for three breaths, eyes closed, attention centered on the pelvis. Notice how stillness now carries a faint vibration—the residue of tuned rhythm. Write your final shorthand: “Track@20 → steady heat, north wall grip, smooth breath.” That becomes your entry data for the next phase.

========================================================================================
This phase is about sustaining the Flow—where tracking ends and rhythm begins. You already know the line of movement; now you live inside it. Begin from your forearm-plank, neutral and still. Inhale to set the ribs, exhale through the Core Rock into the shallow 80%. Keep that same light to medium pressure band you found in Tracking. The goal is to hover there, grazing the north wall without bouncing. Let each exhale melt you forward; each inhale brings you home to baseline. The movement should now feel continuous, like a slow heartbeat in your hips. You’re no longer analyzing; you’re staying inside the pulse.
Because you’re a mesomorph, your body can generate steady torque easily, but that power must stay contained. Think of the stroke as a tide, not a piston. Each rock is a rise and fall, guided by breath rather than muscle. Keep your spine long and belly tight enough that the motion begins from the core, not the glutes. The Plank Scrape’s Flow is delicate work—less thrust, more drag. With a penis under five inches, staying in shallow territory is your advantage; it lets you maintain full contact from ridge to base without slipping past the zone of richest friction. Feel that even texture across the front ridge and underside—like skimming a fingertip over glass warmed by breath.
Your rhythm should find its natural pace in about five cycles. If you notice your breath getting ragged, slow it until every inhale-exhale lasts about four seconds each. The exhale pushes the rock forward; the inhale draws you back. Over time, the stroke becomes self-sustaining—motion and breath locked into a single pattern. When the rhythm lands, you’ll see subtle external cues: the hips pulse evenly, your core stays still, and the motion feels circular rather than linear. That’s Flow. Stay there for up to twenty strokes, then release into neutral and breathe naturally.
As the body warms, the pelvic muscles begin to loosen, and heat pools lower in the abdomen. You’ll sense a shift from muscular effort to floating ease. This is where endurance lives—not in tension but in precision. If your forearms shake or hips sag, that’s your signal to reset, not push through. For your frame, it’s better to do shorter, cleaner flows than long, sloppy ones. Re-enter the pattern only when breath and form return to calm.
When you finish, hold still for three breaths and feel the low hum beneath the navel. You should sense stability and subtle aftershock along the ventral line. Write a single note in your journal: “Flow@20 → smooth tide, shallow zone steady, breath synced.” That’s your evidence of sustainable rhythm.

========================================================================================
This module is about exploring the deep option without forcing it—expansion through awareness, not drive. Begin as always in neutral forearm-plank, steady and lined up. Inhale to fill the ribs, exhale and glide forward through your Core Rock. This time, after three or four shallow cycles, allow the next forward rock to carry a little more weight down through your hips, just enough to enter the mid 10% zone. The angle shifts subtly—tailbone tilts down, spine lengthens, and the pressure along the ventral ridge grows heavier. Keep the breath steady; inhale to prepare, exhale through the entry. The deeper you go, the slower you move.
Because your length is below five inches, true deep penetration isn’t the aim. You’re exploring mid-range tension—the moment just before the wall resistance gives way. Think of it as brushing the edge of a boundary, not breaking through it. For your mesomorph build, the challenge is to stop your hips from overdriving the motion. Spread the load by firming the core and letting the shoulders bear part of the push. The sensation should feel like a smooth descent into thicker air rather than a collision. Pressure stays medium; anything harder disrupts the surface you built in Flow.
At this depth, lubrication and wall traction matter more. If the glide feels sticky or skips, pause in neutral and re-center. On the next attempt, adjust the angle a few degrees—north-northeast if the contact needs more lateral grip, north if you’re losing wall touch. Stay present to her likely cues: a low exhale, hips pressing in, or stillness under your weight. These are signs that the deeper rhythm is landing. If her breath shortens or the pelvic line stiffens, back out immediately to shallow 80%—that’s your safety gate.
Hold each mid-depth sequence for no more than six continuous strokes, then pull back to shallow zone to reset. The alternation between shallow and mid acts like a temperature regulator—warmth rises, then settles. Over time, your body learns to read that edge precisely. The metaphor here is diving in clear water: the goal isn’t depth, it’s clarity. See how far you can glide while keeping sight of the surface.
When the session ends, return to full neutral, rest your weight back, and breathe three slow times through the nose. Feel how the lower abdomen now carries a deep, slow heat. Write your shorthand note: “Deep@6 mid-zone steady, core stable, wall contact clear.” That’s your marker that you’ve expanded range safely without losing precision.

========================================================================================
This phase is about mastery after the crest—Pinning as post-orgasm strategy. You’ve built Flow and explored depth; now you learn to re-enter rhythm in short, intelligent bursts. Begin in forearm-plank, breathing slow, spine long, belly tight enough to keep your hips from sagging. The goal now is not endurance but control—using micro-adjustments in angle, pressure, and tempo to trigger secondary waves without losing presence. From neutral, exhale and glide forward into the shallow 80%. Hold the contact point for one full breath cycle, then draw back just half an inch, enough to maintain friction but regain control of the breath. This is your Pinning baseline.
Each pulse should feel deliberate, almost surgical. Because your mesomorph frame can easily overpower, keep every movement anchored in the abdomen rather than the hips. The motion comes from the exhale, not from muscle strain. Apply medium pressure with the front ridge angled slightly north-northeast or north-northwest, depending on where traction felt richest in Flow. The rhythm should resemble a heartbeat—press, hold, release, reset. If Flow was a tide, Pinning is a metronome.
For a penis under five inches, the precision of these micro-angles is your greatest advantage. You can shift between left and right wall with only a small hip tilt. When you feel her breath deepen or her body still under your weight, that’s your cue to stay still—no extra stroke, just pressure through the exhale. This is how you spark the second and third waves: not through movement, but through held contact. If her hips begin to curl toward you, respond with a single light Core Rock instead of a thrust. That contrast between stillness and glide restarts the charge without breaking rhythm.
You’ll cycle between motion and stillness like a pendulum—Observe, Tweak, Test. If friction fades, angle one or two degrees tighter to the wall. If breath sync breaks, pull back to neutral, breathe twice, and re-enter. This loop builds the sensitivity that separates rough repetition from refined control. Mesomorph strength makes fatigue deceptive here; when your shoulders start to tremble, it’s time to reset. Pinning isn’t about duration, it’s about decision.
When you’re done, rest belly-down, palms open, and breathe low into the pelvis. Feel the slow spread of warmth where effort once lived. Write one journal note: “Pin@12 → hold steady, soft pulse, north wall lock.” That’s your trace of discipline under pressure.

========================================================================================
This final module integrates everything into a four-week rhythm of practice—how you build, rest, and return sharper each time. Begin every session the same way: neutral forearm-plank, breath anchored, joints aligned. Week one is for orientation and load control. Keep each session short—ten minutes of posture, baseline rocking, and breath work. Focus on how your wrists, shoulders, and hips line up. Your goal is not arousal, it’s structure. Think of this as calibrating the instrument before the song. If your mesomorph body wants to muscle through, resist. Let the breath, not the biceps, hold you up. End each session with a single note like, “Baseline stable, breath full, shoulders steady.”
Week two introduces the keystrokes—the building blocks you’ve already trained in isolation. Alternate between left-lean and right-lean versions of the Plank Scrape, ten cycles each, keeping every forward motion slow enough that you can name what wall you’re touching. Work only in the shallow 80%. Each exhale carries you forward; each inhale resets you. Your size means control beats range, so favor clarity over depth. If fatigue hits your forearms or abs, drop to knees for a few breaths, then resume. The pattern here is effort, awareness, rest—never strain.
Week three is your Flow week. The sessions lengthen to about fifteen minutes, and your goal is to find that self-sustaining rhythm. Enter the shallow zone for twenty cycles, rest, then test a mid-zone glide for six cycles. Alternate twice. When rhythm locks in, let your breath lead; when it falters, reset immediately. You’ll notice her cues becoming predictable—hips pulse, breath steadies, stillness grows. These signs tell you your rhythm integrity is landing. Journal in shorthand: “Flow@20+6 → clean tide, wall steady.”
Week four adds the deep and pinning elements together in a single sequence. Start with your usual baseline, then alternate six mid-zone strokes with twelve shallow ones to re-balance. After that, enter the Pinning phase for twelve steady pulses at light-to-medium pressure, exhaling through each hold. End by resting fully, belly to canvas, and breathing until the heartbeat slows. For your mesomorph frame, that final stillness is as important as the motion—it teaches your nervous system to recover fast and stay precise under load.
Repeat this full cycle weekly for a month, then test one extended Flow session without counting. That’s the proof of integration—when technique becomes instinct. Write one last reflection line after each week like, “Week3 → rhythm autonomous, shoulders loose, depth safe.” Over time these short notes become your body’s data map, showing endurance, clarity, and control tightening together.
You’ve now completed the Plank Scrape system, full cycle. Every stroke, every breath, every rest point is yours to refine.
