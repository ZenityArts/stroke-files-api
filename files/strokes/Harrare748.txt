Module 1 for The Harrare is about setting your body up so the stroke can be performed safely and clearly from start to finish.
Begin in forearm plank with your knees supported on the canvas. As an ectomorph, you have less natural cushioning in your joints, so the load must be distributed evenly across elbows, shoulders, and core. Keep your shoulders stacked directly over your elbows, spine aligned in a straight line, and hips level to the canvas. This posture prevents energy leaks and protects your wrists and shoulders from unnecessary strain. Before beginning any stroke sequence, always find this neutral baseline so your penis enters at the same downward diagonal and you can feel exactly how contact shifts when you drop or sweep a hip.
Depth control is critical with a penis below five inches. The shorter length allows sharper contact with the canal walls, but only if you stay within the shallow 80% zone where clarity is strongest. Mid depth can be tested later if her cues open, but early training must stay shallow to avoid slippage. Keep pressure light-to-medium at first, pairing each movement with your breath. Inhale to prepare, exhale as you angle or rock. This rhythm prevents rushing and teaches your body that the stroke is built on steadiness, not drive.
As you settle into plank, think of your hips as a compass dial that can point north, south, east, or west within her canal. Your job is to keep the dial steady when in neutral, so every deviation—dropping one hip, sweeping across, or lifting diagonally—creates a deliberate stroke. With your body type, staying compact and precise works better than trying to stretch the range. Each motion should be at least a finger-width, never smaller, so you feel and she feels a clear change of angle.
Posture here also supports stamina. An ectomorph’s lighter frame can fatigue quickly if the core is not engaged. Tighten your abdomen slightly, draw the navel toward the spine, and let your breath expand the ribcage rather than arching your back. This small adjustment reduces joint pressure and lets you sustain long sets without collapse. She will feel the steadiness in how your weight distributes over her, which builds trust in the motion.
The reflection piece in this module is noticing how alignment gives you clearer wall feedback. In the first cycles, focus only on staying in plank, breathing into your ribcage, and keeping the penis angled downward without slipping deeper than intended. Watch for her cues—if she exhales slowly or her hips rise into you, that tells you the posture is giving her consistent stimulation. Your journal after practice can be as simple as: “Neutral plank held, shallow angle steady, breath matched, hips stayed level.”

Module 2 for The Harrare will take the raw setup from Module 1 and break it down into keystrokes that you can practice as individual building blocks.
The first keystroke begins with a left hip drop. From neutral plank, exhale and let the left hip sink toward the canvas. This angles the head of your penis to the right, pressing into her right wall at the shallow 80% depth zone. Because of your ectomorph build and below 5-inch length, the angle here gives sharper wall contact. Keep pressure light-to-medium so the motion feels like a clear brush, not a jab. She is likely to respond with a deeper breath or hips nudging back. Reset to neutral before moving on.
The next keystroke flows from that drop into a sweep. Allow the right hip to follow down, joining the left so both hips hover close to the canvas. This movement shifts the penis diagonally, sweeping across her canal and gliding up into her north wall. The motion is mostly rocking with a trace of angling, still in the shallow zone. Medium pressure paired with an exhale gives a steady glide that she may answer with a pelvic curl or stillness. As an ectomorph, avoid collapsing your frame here—keep your core braced so the motion stays smooth.
From that joined-hip sweep, raise your right hip back up to its starting height while keeping the left hip low. This keystroke sweeps the penis back from the north wall to the right wall, a lateral rocking motion that maintains shallow depth. This motion fits best in Tracking, teaching you how different compass walls respond. For your build and size, clarity comes from tempo control—slower sweeps make each wall distinct. She will often soften her breath here, signaling the wall hit is exact.
The reset keystroke lifts the hips back into a clean plank. From there, a finishing angle guides your penis to massage between her right wall and the south wall. This keystroke mixes angling with rocking, and because your length is below 5 inches, the shallow reach makes this diagonal stand out. Keep pressure light, let the breath exhale through, and feel for her body pressing subtly back to you.
On the other side, the mirror sequence begins with a right hip drop. Exhale as the hip lowers toward the canvas, angling the penis left into her left wall. The same jointed sweep follows: the left hip joins down, sweeping across to the north wall. This is rocking again, shallow zone, with medium pressure. Reflection here is about symmetry—notice if her cues differ left-to-right, and adjust angle or tempo in response.
The return sweep lifts the left hip while the right stays low, guiding you from north wall back to the left wall. Hold medium pressure, keep tempo steady, and return to plank at the end. The final diagonal reset massages between the left wall and the south wall, again in shallow range. Think of it as drawing a clean corner of the compass with your hips, always returning to the baseline.
Taken together, these keystrokes build the full Harrare sequence. The training map begins with mastering the hip drop on each side—left hip, then right hip—because they teach you how angling creates wall contact. Once comfortable, add the joined sweep motions to feel the diagonal pull across the north wall. Only after those are steady should you practice the return sweeps and diagonal resets, as they require cleaner control. Practicing in this order ensures your body learns to stabilize, then sweep, then combine into rhythm. In time, these keystrokes interlock into a flowing stroke that can sustain Tracking, enter Flow, and later create Pinning pressure.
Critical adaptations for an ectomorph with below 5-inch size are clear. Keep every keystroke shallow at first, pressure never beyond medium, and tempo slower so each compass wall is distinct. Guard the wrists and shoulders by always re-engaging your core at reset, keeping hips from sagging. Your stamina protection lies in breath timing—inhale before movement, exhale through it, never holding tension in the spine. A simple journal entry might read: “Left drop, shallow, light pressure, hips nudged back on third rep.”

Module 3 for The Harrare is where the isolated keystrokes are woven into a complete rhythm. The goal here is to make each motion flow into the next without losing the clarity of wall contact, depth control, or breath timing. Think of it as stringing beads on a cord—each bead is a keystroke, but the cord is your breath and the plank baseline that holds them in sequence.
Begin by chaining the left hip drop into the joined sweep. From neutral plank, inhale to prepare, then exhale as you drop the left hip toward the canvas. This is an angling action that steers the head of the penis into her right wall at the shallow 80% zone with light to medium pressure. Without pausing, let the right hip lower so both hips meet the canvas, rocking you through a sweep across the north wall. Inhale as you return to plank. Inside her body this feels like a gliding arc from right wall into north wall, and she may show cues such as a softening belly or a steadying exhale. The journal tag for this chain could read, “Right→North, shallow, Medium, cue at rep three.”
Mirror the sequence on the opposite side. From neutral, exhale into the right hip drop, angling into her left wall at shallow depth with controlled light pressure, then follow into the joined sweep across the north wall. Inhale as you reset into plank. This chain draws her left wall into the rhythm and balances your patterning. With penis length under five inches, the sweep will remain in the shallow zone, which actually sharpens wall contact instead of blunting it. She may answer with a subtle pelvic curl as you cross the north wall. A short record might read, “Left→North, shallow, Light, pelvic curl at rep four.”
Next, connect the joined sweep with the return sweep. Inhale at neutral, exhale through the joined sweep across the north wall, then lift one hip back to original height while the other stays low, creating a diagonal return glide. This is both a rocking and angling quality, brushing the north wall back into the side wall at shallow 80%. Reset in plank with an inhale. This motion often sparks a sigh or a long exhale from her as the direction change hits different muscle bands. Write it simply: “North→Side, shallow, Medium, exhale at rep two.”
Finally, link the return sweep into the diagonal reset. After finishing the return glide, exhale into the hip drop that aims you into the south wall at shallow 80%, using light pressure. Inhale as you fully reset to plank before starting again. For an ectomorph, this sequence requires guarding against collapsing shoulders—keep elbows firm and spine straight. For below-five-inch length, the south contact should stay shallow; chasing depth risks losing clarity. She may pull you subtly inward if the contact is clean. Record it as: “Side→South, shallow, Light, pull-in at rep three.”
Across all sequences, the emphasis is on rhythm integrity. Each chain is two keystrokes long, with an inhale at plank, an exhale through action, and a full reset before repeating. Five cycles per side with short rests builds neural memory without overloading ectomorphic joints. The metaphor to carry here is tracing clean diagonals with a paintbrush—every stroke should begin and end cleanly, not smear. The steadier your chains, the more her cues will confirm compass accuracy.

Module 4 for The Harrare is about running the first full Tracking phase, where you use the shallow 80% zone to test compass accuracy and refine execution with the SSP loop. The emphasis is not on sustaining long Flow yet, but on forming hypotheses about wall response, testing them in short sets, and journaling clear cues.
Start in the neutral forearm-plank, inhale to stabilize, and exhale into the left hip drop leading into the joined sweep. Work only in shallow depth with light to medium pressure, keeping the contact sharp against the right and north walls. Run three to five repetitions, watching for signs such as a deeper breath or hips settling. If she shows a pelvic curl or exhale when you cross north, note that as your first hypothesis: north sweep with light pressure holds her attention. Journal something like, “Right→North, shallow, Light, pelvic curl at rep four.” Reset to plank after each mini set to keep joints safe.
Mirror the test on the right-to-left chain. Exhale into the right hip drop, sweep across the north wall, and inhale back to baseline. Again, limit depth to shallow, using light pressure, and keep cycles short. You may notice a soft sigh or her hips pressing back toward you on the second repetition, which suggests the left wall entry is sharpening her arousal. Record it simply, “Left→North, shallow, Light, hips back at rep two.” These repetitions are not about speed but about feeling how her canal reacts to each directional arc.
Add return sweeps to the loop, always shallow and controlled. Exhale through the joined sweep, then lift one hip while the other stays down, brushing the north back into the side wall. Inhale at reset. Her response here may be a pause or stillness, which is often a sign the change of direction hits deeper muscle tension. For ectomorphic frames, shoulder fatigue can build, so after five cycles rest elbows lightly on the canvas before restarting. A simple log might read, “North→Side, shallow, Medium, stillness at rep three.”
Run each of these sequences twice, never more than five reps at a time, keeping the breath anchors strict: inhale at plank, exhale through action, inhale again on reset. This pacing prevents stamina loss and protects ectomorphic joints. The penis size under five inches makes shallow testing more precise because the head stays snug on each wall without sliding into mid zones prematurely. That precision is your advantage in this phase.
By the end of Tracking, you should have at least two or three walls that show consistent cues—deeper breath, pelvic curl, hips pressing, or a sigh. These are your compass points to carry into Flow later. Keep journaling in short one-line notes to mark which arc drew the clearest signal. The SSP loop here is simple: define the arc, hypothesize how she may respond, test a short set, observe her cue, and refine the next pass.

==========================================================================================================






Module 5 for The Harrare is where you shift from short tracking sets into true Flow, sustaining a rhythm that stays inside the shallow 80% and occasionally brushes into mid-zone when the canal response calls for it. The focus is on breathing into tempo, keeping pressure steady, and learning how to hold a groove long enough for her body to start pulsing back at you.
Begin in neutral plank, inhale to stabilize, and exhale as you drop one hip into the first diagonal sweep. Instead of stopping after three or four reps, keep the cycle running at a calm pace, always exhaling through the sweep and inhaling as you return to baseline. Keep pressure light to medium, never hard, because your below-five-inch size makes shallow strokes most effective. The snug canal grip will highlight every small angle, so staying shallow protects precision. She is likely to answer with deeper breathing or a pelvic curl as she adjusts to the steady tempo. When you notice her hips pressing in rhythm, that is the sign that Flow is beginning to take hold.
Alternate the left-to-right and right-to-left chains, keeping the compass arcs consistent. A metaphor here is like tracing the edge of a bowl with water inside—if you keep a smooth glide around the rim, the water keeps circling without spilling. The canal walls respond in the same way; when you sustain pressure on the north wall or return arcs toward the side walls, her muscles begin to catch the rhythm. As an ectomorph, your shoulders and elbows need rest hygiene, so every ten cycles reset to plank, take two full breaths, and then re-enter Flow. This preserves stamina without breaking rhythm for her, because she will feel your return as a re-entry rather than a pause.
When cues show she is ready—her breath deepens, hips settle, or a sigh escapes—you can let one or two cycles brush into the mid 10% depth. Keep the entry slow, exhaling fully, then retreating to shallow. This should feel to her like a sudden pressure bloom before you return to lighter contact. Do not chase deep insertion; your strength is in staying shallow and precise. Journal an observation like, “Left→North arc, shallow with one mid brush, Medium pressure, hips pressed back at cycle seven.”
Sustaining Flow means holding tempo with breath anchors, Light-to-Medium pressure, and shallow arcs that repeat long enough to let her nervous system sync with yours. The goal here is not to surprise her but to create predictability that her body can ride. This predictability is what unlocks the deeper reflex responses you’ll use in later modules.

==========================================================================================================




Module 6 for The Harrare is where you carefully test whether her body will allow expansion into the mid or deep ten percent of depth. This module is less about adding power and more about learning how to open the door and close it again without strain. You are still working in forearm plank, but now every drop of your hip and sweep of the arc is done with full breath control and deliberate pacing.
Start from neutral baseline, inhale through the nose, and as you exhale drop your hip into the first diagonal sweep as you would in shallow Flow. After a few cycles, allow one arc to slide a little deeper, brushing into mid-zone. Because you are below five inches, this movement will not threaten cervix contact, but you must still gate the depth so that pressure remains Medium and never Hard. Think of it like gently pressing into a soft clay mold—enough to leave a mark, not enough to deform the shape. She will let you know if the deeper zone is welcomed: hips pressing back, breath catching and releasing, or her pelvic floor curling upward around you. If she stiffens or pulls away, retreat immediately to shallow arcs and re-establish Flow.
As an ectomorph, your frame can hold plank well, but your joints can fatigue quickly. Do not chase deep repetitions for long. Two or three deep brushes inside a ten-cycle set are enough. Reset to baseline fully, take a slow inhale, and then resume shallow rhythm. This protects your elbows and spine while also keeping the experience for her sharp and noticeable, not dull through repetition. Keep pressure at Medium on entry and lighten as you return shallow; this creates a wave effect that her body can ride without bracing. Journal with something simple like, “North wall brush mid, Medium pressure, hips pulled in, retreat at cycle five.”
The purpose here is not to live in the deep ten percent but to explore it safely and create contrast. For her, the sudden swell of depth followed by the return to shallow feels like a tide rolling in and slipping back. This contrast builds anticipation and makes her more responsive when you stay shallow afterward. For you, it sharpens depth control, breath timing, and the ability to make quick adjustments if cues show discomfort. When practiced correctly, this module teaches that depth is a tool, not a constant, and that your strength lies in controlling when and how it appears.

==========================================================================================================




Module 7 for The Harrare is where you step into post-orgasm strategy and use Pinning to spark multiple waves. The goal now is not building momentum but holding her in the sensitivity pocket and shifting pressure in small, controlled bursts that keep her body responding after climax. You will still be in forearm plank, but your hips and pelvis work in much tighter arcs, always returning to baseline so that you never collapse form or overload your joints.
Begin in shallow Flow until her breathing deepens and her body gives the signal of release—a soft exhale, a tremor, or her hips tightening and then loosening. As soon as that moment hits, exhale yourself and drop into the Pinning pattern. Here you choose one keystroke, such as the diagonal sweep across the north wall, and hold it steady with Medium pressure. The pressure is constant, but every three or four breaths you tweak either angle, depth, or tempo slightly. This could mean a one-finger-width shift deeper into mid zone, or a subtle angling of the hip so that the head drags along a new corner of the wall. Because your size is below five inches, these tweaks must be precise and clear, not wide or forceful, so she feels definition rather than blunt pressure.
As an ectomorph, you have the advantage of keeping form light and steady, but your frame can fatigue fast if you overstay. Keep each Pinning burst to about five or six breaths, then retreat to baseline and reset with a slow inhale. If her hips curl up toward you, or she presses down into the contact, that is the cue to extend the burst another cycle. If she stills or her breath goes shallow, pull back to Flow or Tracking and give her space before attempting again. Journal a line like, “Right wall pin, shallow to mid, Medium pressure, hips curled at rep three, retreat after rep six.”
Think of Pinning like placing a warm iron on fabric—you are not pressing to crush, you are holding to smooth and release. The steadiness is what allows her body to unfold into multiple orgasms, and the micro-tweaks give each one a slightly different flavor so her nervous system stays engaged. Done correctly, you will feel her body clench and release in waves, and she may ride into another orgasm without needing a full reset.

Module 8 for The Harrare ties everything together into a four-week training plan so you can grow from keystroke isolation into confident rhythm mastery. The plan works in waves: you start with clarity of posture and baseline resets, layer in keystroke accuracy, then build sequencing and rhythm integrity, and finally move into sustainable Flow and controlled Pinning. Think of it as walking the path from learning single notes to playing an instrument smoothly—each week builds the muscle memory, stamina, and subtlety you will need for her body to respond reliably.
In the first week your focus should remain on setup and keystroke training. Every session begins with a neutral forearm-plank hold, shoulders stacked and wrists aligned, then five or six clean executions of each keystroke into the shallow 80% zone. For an ectomorph, this is critical because your lighter frame can drift or over-extend if you skip baseline resets. Keep sessions short and purposeful, pausing after each cycle to log a simple journal line like, “Left hip drop, shallow, Light pressure, no cue.” These logs are what give you feedback to refine.
Week two blends keystrokes into short stroke chains. You should select two or three movements and run them back-to-back, always with breath anchoring the rhythm: inhale to prepare, exhale through the sweep, then return to baseline. Because your size is below five inches, clarity of angle matters more than sheer depth, so focus on sharp compass definition—north wall sweeps, side-to-side transitions, and diagonal pivots that create contrast she can feel. Partner cues in this phase are often subtle, like a deeper exhale or a pelvic curl, so watch closely and adapt pressure from Light to Medium accordingly.
Week three is where rhythm training expands into Flow. Here you work in sustained sequences of ten to twelve cycles, keeping pressure in the shallow zone and allowing only brief dips into mid when her body signals receptivity. For your frame, manage stamina by using the hips and core more than the shoulders, and by resting in baseline every third or fourth breath. You should notice her cues grow clearer here—hips pressing in, a stilling body, or repeated exhales as she locks onto the rhythm. Journal lines like, “North wall sweep, shallow-mid, Medium pressure, hips pressed at rep eight.”
In the final week you practice integrating Pinning bursts after Flow. As her body climbs toward release, you switch from sequencing to holding one keystroke steady, layering micro-shifts in angle or pressure every three or four breaths. For you, depth gating is essential: never push past shallow or controlled mid. Instead, let the definition of your angle create the intensity. Your lighter frame gives you precision here, and her body will show it through trembling, curling, or soft vocal releases. End each session with reflection, noting which keystrokes carried her deepest and which fatigued your frame most, so you can refine pacing for the next round.
If you hold to this four-week cycle—baseline first, then keystrokes, then chains, then Flow with Pinning—you will arrive at a place where The Harrare is not just a learned stroke but a living rhythm her body trusts. Each adaptation—stamina pacing for ectomorph build, angle clarity for below five inches—becomes the guardrail that keeps you safe and effective. Done steadily, this plan turns keystroke mechanics into an automatic body-language skill.
