Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Bata Coxa Stroke! I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m excited to work with you—an ectomorph with a penis between 5 and 7 inches. Your naturally lean, agile physique combined with your moderate extension gives you fantastic finesse and speed. Though your extension is moderate, each inch is packed with sensitivity, and with the right technique, you can create a cumulative performance that is as effective as it is refined.
Before we begin, please find a quiet, comfortable space where you can focus completely without distractions. Sit or lie down, relax your lean shoulders, and take several deep, controlled breaths until your mind is clear and ready to absorb every detail of our session. Today, we’re going to transform your natural athleticism into a meticulously choreographed sequence that will maximize intimate pleasure through scientific precision.
We begin with the classic missionary position—but with modifications designed especially for your ectomorphic build. Start by getting into a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface. This foundational stance is critical for your lean frame because it gives you the stability to execute the micro‑movements necessary for the Bata Coxa Stroke. Next, insert your penis at a precise downward diagonal angle into your partner. This insertion sets the blueprint for your stroke, as the angle determines the dynamics of your subsequent movements.
Your first action is a smooth forward push—moving your entire body north toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, the top shelf of your penis glides gently across her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is moderate, it’s essential that you direct the majority of your stimulation to the shallow, highly sensitive zone. We achieve this by applying the 80‑10‑10 principle, which dictates that about 80% of your force should be focused on the shallow (1–3 inches) zone, with the remaining force evenly split—10% for the mid‑depth (approximately 3–5 inches) and 10% for the deep (beyond 5 inches). This controlled distribution is key to ensuring that every forward push delivers maximum impact where it counts most without overwhelming any particular area.
After you complete the forward push, you transition into the lateral phase—the hallmark of the Bata Coxa Stroke. Here, you’ll use the versatility of your ectomorphic agility to perform a precise lateral movement with your left hip. During this phase, as you drop your left hip toward the canvas, the hilt (base) of your penis adds steady pressure and friction, beginning from the northern section of your partner’s vaginal opening and traveling toward the western section. Simultaneously, your penis reorients so that its inner surface points east, generating heat and upward friction that massages from the eastern wall to the northern wall of her vaginal canal. This carefully controlled movement is then reversed by raising your left hip back toward center, altering the pressure so that the stimulation shifts from the western section to the northern section, with your penis now pointing north to massage from the northern wall up toward the eastern wall.
You then repeat a similar cycle at varying paces—the drop and raise of the left hip at a faster, half-distance movement, followed by another drop—and finally a full raise back to center. The combination of these variations creates a rhythmic “W” pattern that is the signature of the Bata Coxa Stroke. Each micro‑movement in this cycle works cumulatively, ensuring that the stimulation is continuously built and remains balanced. Through these deliberate movements, you convert raw, natural power into a finely tuned performance that is both controlled and cumulative.
This introductory module sets the stage for everything that follows. Our goal is to transform your natural ectomorphic agility and moderate extension into a stroke that is both scientifically precise and deeply intimate. Every forward push, lateral shift, and reversal is designed with the 80‑10‑10 principle in mind, ensuring that maximum stimulation is delivered right where it counts. Welcome, brother—let’s begin this journey toward intimate mastery with the Bata Coxa Stroke!
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Before we fully break down the Bata Coxa Stroke, it’s essential to understand the core principles that will guide your technique. These include the 80‑10‑10 principle, the Sexual Scientific Process (which encompasses tracking and flow), and the tap keystroke drill. Let’s explore each element in detail.
The 80‑10‑10 Principle: This principle is the cornerstone of our technique. It instructs you to allocate approximately 80% of your applied force to the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches—which is the most sensitive area. The remaining 20% is divided equally between the mid‑depth (about 3–5 inches) and the deep (beyond 5 inches) zones. In practice, this means every movement you make must be precisely calibrated so that the majority of the stimulation is focused on the most sensitive area. For the Bata Coxa Stroke, this controlled distribution is crucial in allowing you to build cumulative stimulation without overwhelming any part of the vaginal canal.
The Sexual Scientific Process: This is a systematic, iterative method for refining your technique. It has four key steps:
Define Goal: Identify exactly what you want to achieve—for example, maximizing stimulation along a specific vaginal wall during a left hip drop.
Form Hypothesis: Based on your observations and feedback, predict which slight adjustments in your movement might enhance stimulation.
Track: Methodically perform your stroke—aiming for at least 30 repetitions on each “wall”—and record data from both your internal cues (how your muscles feel, your core engagement, etc.) and your partner’s responses (her breathing, subtle verbal cues, or changes in posture).
Flow: Once you find the stroke variation that consistently produces the optimal response, commit to that rhythm until your movements become automatic and fluid.
By cycling through these steps, you continuously refine your technique until it becomes an instinctive part of your performance.
Tracking: Tracking is the process of gathering and analyzing data from your repeated strokes. As you perform each variation of the Bata Coxa Stroke, pay close attention to your partner’s reactions—does her breathing become more rhythmic? Do her subtle movements indicate increased stimulation? Additionally, pay attention to how your body feels: is your core stable? Are your lateral movements precise? This feedback is vital as it informs you what works and what requires adjustment, allowing you to fine‑tune your technique over time.
Flow: Flow is the state in which your stroke becomes a seamless, automatic sequence. After rigorous tracking and refining, you’ll reach a point where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed in a continuous rhythm without conscious thought—every movement perfectly in sync. This state of flow guarantees that the 80‑10‑10 distribution is maintained consistently, producing a stroke that is both efficient and deeply pleasurable.
The Tap Keystroke: The tap keystroke is a foundational drill to perfect your lateral control. In simple terms, it involves starting in a stable position (often a forearm plank), then shifting laterally until your hip makes a gentle “tap” on the surface before returning smoothly to center. This controlled, minimal movement trains your lateral muscles and pelvic floor, building the muscle memory required for consistent, deliberate shifts that form an essential component of the Bata Coxa Stroke. The synchronization of deep, controlled breathing with this movement further enhances precision, ensuring that every lateral shift contributes effectively to cumulative stimulation.
Together, these elements form the backbone of your training process. They ensure that every movement of the Bata Coxa Stroke is executed with scientific precision—focusing the majority of the force on the shallow, most sensitive areas while still engaging the deeper layers effectively. With a clear understanding of the 80‑10‑10 principle, the Sexual Scientific Process (including tracking and flow), and the tap keystroke drill, you’re now fully prepared to execute the Bata Coxa Stroke with technical mastery.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Bata Coxa Stroke into its fundamental components so you can master each individual element before uniting them into a fluid, cumulative performance. Picture yourself in the missionary position once again—on top in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable canvas. For an ectomorph with a penis below 5 inches, precision is critical. We’re going to isolate each phase of this stroke, which is designed to trace a dynamic “W” pattern across your partner’s vaginal canal, and examine exactly how each micro‑movement contributes to cumulative stimulation.
Forward Movement: The stroke begins with a careful insertion—your penis is inserted at a precise, downward diagonal angle into your partner. From this starting point, you gently push your entire body forward, moving northward toward her head. During this forward push, the top shelf of your compact penis glides gently across her clitoral area, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push primes the area so that, according to the 80‑10‑10 principle, about 80% of your applied force is concentrated on the shallow zone (roughly the first 1 to 3 inches), where sensitivity is at its peak. Since your extension is shorter, every inch of that forward movement must be executed with utmost precision to make the most of that concentrated stimulation.
Lateral Shift (Left Hip Drop): After the forward push, you transition to the lateral phase by dropping your left hip toward the canvas. In this phase, the hilt (or base) of your penis applies focused pressure to the left side of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, your penis reorients—its inner surface points to the right, creating friction and a gentle rocking effect along the right wall of her vaginal canal. As you shuttle your body laterally upward toward her head, this drop produces friction, heat, and cumulative stimulation across that region. This lateral drop is precise and must be performed with steady control so that the stimulation follows the 80‑10‑10 distribution, focusing most of the force in the shallow, sensitive area.
Hip Raise Back to Center (First Reversal): Immediately after the left hip drop, you raise your left hip back toward the center. In doing so, the hilt of your penis applies pressure starting from the western section of her vaginal opening and moving toward the northern section. Concurrently, your penis reorients so that it points north, producing an upward massage along the northern wall toward the eastern wall. This reversal is critical—it shifts the stimulation pattern and helps to integrate the cumulative effects from the previous phase. Precision in timing and movement is key so that the delicate balance is maintained.
Repeating with Variations in Pace: The stroke then repeats the drop and raise sequence. At times, you may raise your left hip only halfway toward the center, moving faster to introduce a variation in pressure—this faster pace intensifies friction and creates a different pattern of cumulative stimulation. In one phase, the hilt’s pressure starts from the western section and moves to a midpoint before reaching the northern section, with your penis maintaining an upward massage on the eastern wall. The sequence is then repeated: a full drop, followed by a half-raise at a faster pace, then a drop again—all creating subtle variations that keep the cumulative stimulation evolving.
Final Full Return to Center: After these variations, the stroke is completed by fully raising your left hip back to center, applying consistent pressure that moves from the western section of the vaginal opening up through the northern section, with your penis aligned to direct stimulation from the northern wall to the eastern wall. This final phase resets the cycle, and the entire sequence is then repeated, ensuring continuous cumulative stimulation.
By deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into its discrete components—forward push, lateral tap (via the tap keystroke), controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle—you create a clear, step‑by‑step blueprint for your training. Each phase must be performed with absolute precision and strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that roughly 80% of your force is delivered to the shallow zone while the mid‑depth and deep zones are engaged gently. This detailed breakdown is your roadmap for transforming raw, concentrated energy into a rhythmically cumulative performance that delivers profound, targeted stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each component of the Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as breathing. With your lean ectomorphic build and a penis below 5 inches, precision and consistency are absolutely paramount. In this module, we’re going to engage in repetitive, focused practice for each segmented phase, ensuring that every repetition adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and that your compact extension is handled with exacting care.
Forward Movement Drill: Get into your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface to support your agile frame. Insert your penis at the predetermined downward diagonal angle, then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Concentrate on the sensation as the top shelf of your compact penis glides gently over her clitoral area, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is compact, about 80% of your force must be focused on that shallow, nerve‑rich zone. Execute this forward push slowly and with deliberate control, and repeat the motion several times until you can replicate it with consistent, smooth precision.
Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): From your forward position, carefully raise your left hip in a small, controlled lateral shift until your hip makes a gentle tap on the supporting surface. Visualize the mechanics of the movement: as you drop your left hip, the hilt of your penis applies targeted pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening, while the shaft rotates slightly so that its inner surface points to the right, generating a subtle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Coordinate each lateral tap with deep, controlled breathing—inhaling deeply before the shift and exhaling slowly as you complete the tap. To further enhance your precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor with every lateral shift. Drill this lateral movement repeatedly, aiming for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke becomes a natural component of your muscle memory.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: After you complete the lateral tap, focus on the lowering phase. Slowly lower your raised hip until it gently contacts the supportive surface. As you lower, pay close attention to the sensation of the underbelly of your penis beginning to apply controlled, cumulative pressure against her lower vaginal wall, while the upper shelf maintains consistent contact with her upper wall. Next, practice the backward shuttle by slowly and deliberately retracting your body so that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall, allowing you to reset your position without fully withdrawing. Repeat the complete sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times until every transition is fluid and every micro‑movement strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Throughout each drill, ensure that your breathing remains deep, slow, and synchronized with every movement. Each deep inhale should focus your concentration on the next micro‑movement, while each controlled exhale facilitates smooth, natural transitions between phases. With disciplined, focused practice, your lean ectomorphic agility and compact extension will merge to produce a series of precise, cumulative movements that become second nature.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—that’s the true art of the Bata Coxa Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your entire focus dedicated to fluid integration. In this module, you’ll merge your forward push, lateral taps (executed via the tap keystroke), controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle into a unified, rhythmic cycle that forms the “W” pattern inherent in the stroke.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the optimal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward—moving north toward your partner’s head. As you do so, ensure that the top shelf of your compact penis consistently glides over her clitoral area and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward drive lays the foundation for cumulative stimulation and must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, concentrating about 80% of your force on the shallow, sensitive zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase. Execute three controlled lateral taps by raising your left hip in that practiced tap keystroke. Focus intently on how the hilt of your penis applies targeted pressure on the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Once you’ve completed these lateral taps, gradually lower your raised hip so that the underbelly of your penis maintains consistent, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf remains in solid contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a smooth, deliberate backward shuttle until you return to your starting position, ensuring that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall throughout.
After one full cycle on one side, reset and mirror the entire sequence on the opposite side. Now, raise your right hip laterally and perform three deliberate lateral taps—ensuring that the right side of your penis engages the left vaginal opening while the left side delivers a complementary, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall—then lower your hip in a controlled manner and shuttle backward until you return to your original position. This alternating “walking” motion of your hips creates a rhythmic, cumulative pattern that ensures balanced stimulation across all areas, in perfect adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout this integrated routine, let your deep, rhythmic breathing serve as your internal metronome—each deep inhale prepares your body for the next micro‑movement, and each controlled exhale facilitates smooth transitions. With every complete cycle, your natural ectomorphic precision and compact extension will merge into a continuous, fluid performance—a Bata Coxa Stroke that is both scientifically refined and deeply intimate.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, we focus on fine‑tuning every micro‑adjustment of your Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimum cumulative stimulation. With your lean ectomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every movement must be executed with exceptional precision to adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that approximately 80% of your applied force targets the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep zones.
As you cycle through your integrated routine, observe every nuance of your movement. During the forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your compact penis consistently caresses her clitoral region while the head remains in deliberate, constant contact with her “south wall.” Then, when executing your lateral taps using the tap keystroke, pay close attention to the natural, subtle rocking motion generated by your precise, controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even slight modifications in your lateral angle can have significant impact on the overall stimulation. Experiment with minute adjustments—a change of one or two degrees in your hip lift, for example—and carefully observe how these adjustments affect the distribution of pressure and the rocking effect. Use your partner’s feedback—her deepened breathing, subtle verbal cues, or gentle shifts in her posture—as critical data points. This iterative process of defining your objective, hypothesizing slight modifications, tracking the outcomes, and refining your technique is the essence of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout each cycle. Every deep inhale should channel your focus and prepare your body for the next micro‑movement, while each deliberate exhale should facilitate smooth transitions between phases. Over time, as you continuously track your internal sensations and your partner’s responses, you will enter a state of flow—a seamless, automatic performance where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with flawless precision. When you achieve this state of flow, your Bata Coxa Stroke becomes an effortless, rhythmic expression of cumulative stimulation that is both scientifically optimized and deeply intimate.
Remember, brother, every tiny adjustment counts. Your athletic ectomorphic build and balanced extension allow you to deliver precise stimulation if every micro‑movement is executed with consistency and finesse. Monitor your internal cues—your core contractions, the engagement of your pelvic floor—and align them with the subtle feedback from your partner. With persistent refinement and continual tracking, your stroke will evolve into a naturally flowing performance that maximizes pleasure while maintaining meticulous control.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen designed to reinforce every element of the Bata Coxa Stroke while simultaneously strengthening the core and overall stability that are essential for your lean ectomorphic build with a penis between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your comprehensive blueprint for transforming your natural athletic precision into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically optimized stimulation.
Begin by creating your own dedicated training space—a quiet, private environment where you can focus exclusively on perfecting your technique, free from distractions. Each training session should commence with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically for your ectomorphic physique. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back—these muscle groups are the foundation that supports every controlled micro‑movement in the Bata Coxa Stroke. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle fiber for the intricate work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for the session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target each component of the stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees securely planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis size between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Synchronize each lateral tap with deliberate breathing—inhale deeply before the shift and exhale slowly as you complete the movement. To further ensure consistency, incorporate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each lateral tap. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke is completely ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve mastered the lateral tap, integrate it with vertical movements. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps, and then finish with a smooth, gradual backward shuttle. Make sure that every transition adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle—directing about 80% of your force to the shallow zone while evenly engaging the mid‑depth and deep layers. Drill this integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until every movement flows seamlessly together. To further enhance your balance and precision, supplement your stroke‑specific drills with targeted core strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills. A strong core is essential for maintaining both the stability and control needed for the Bata Coxa Stroke. Keep a detailed training journal where you record every session, noting the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you make, and the feedback you receive from your partner. This journal is a crucial tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, helping you track your progress and continuously refine your technique.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With consistent, disciplined practice, you’ll transform your natural athletic mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of your dedicated training, where your athletic ectomorphic build and your penis size between 5 and 7 inches converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your mind solely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, make sure that the top shelf of your penis consistently caresses her clitoral region and that the head maintains firm, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward drive must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with about 80% of your force focused on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone while the remaining force is delicately balanced to stimulate both the mid‑depth and deep areas.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your right hip. Raise your hip in a controlled, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps. With every tap, focus intently on ensuring that the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening, while the inner surface of your penis produces a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. If any lateral tap seems inconsistent—if the pressure is uneven or the angle is slightly off—pause and isolate that specific movement. Drill it repeatedly until both your internal feedback and your partner’s subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position and allows you to gather precise internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, pay close attention to the contraction in your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor. Listen carefully to any subtle feedback from your partner—her breathing, slight body movements, or soft verbal responses indicate whether adjustments are needed. This troubleshooting moment is essential; it’s where you make minor modifications (such as a slight tweak in your lateral angle or a change in the pace of your forward push) to further optimize cumulative stimulation. Utilize the iterative cycle of the Sexual Scientific Process: define your objective for that cycle, hypothesize a small adjustment, track the outcome meticulously, and refine your technique accordingly.
Once you have fine‑tuned your technique, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the entire cycle on the opposite side to ensure that balanced stimulation is achieved across the full expanse of the vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every micro‑movement is executed automatically with flawless precision—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you reach that state, your Bata Coxa Stroke will stand as a testament to your discipline, technical mastery, and intimate sensitivity—a continuous, fluid performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your achievement, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements are what transform your dedicated training into an art form—a performance where every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and deeply balanced stimulation. Your athletic mesomorph strength and balanced extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure in every movement. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Bata Coxa Stroke bring you closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
