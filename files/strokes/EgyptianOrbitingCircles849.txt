Module 1 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles teaches your body how to set up and stabilize before movement begins. The goal is to create a solid base—your neutral position—so every orbit feels anchored and effortless. Begin on a mat in forearm plank. Elbows sit directly under shoulders, hands relaxed and facing inward, forming a triangle that supports your chest. Your feet should be slightly wider than hip distance; this stance is ideal for the endomorph body type because it distributes weight evenly and prevents joint strain. Inhale through your nose and feel your abdomen expand toward the floor; exhale through your mouth and let your hips find their natural midpoint—not sagging, not lifted. This is your baseline.
The Egyptian Orbiting Circles demand precision in posture before power. Imagine your pelvis as a bowl of water—your job is to move the water without spilling it. This single metaphor helps you feel the control required in every orbit. As an endomorph, your larger muscle groups—glutes, thighs, and shoulders—carry more mass, which can create leverage but also fatigue if alignment slips. Keep pressure in your forearms Light to Medium. If your shoulders start to shake or your lower back feels pinched, that’s your cue to pause, exhale fully, and reset to neutral. This rhythm of exertion and reset builds stamina safely.
Each breath organizes your motion. Inhale as you prepare; exhale as you stabilize. Keep the breath smooth and rhythmic. The Egyptian Orbiting Circles are built around shallow circular motion that will later expand into angled orbits, so begin now with awareness of the compass. The shallow 80% of your depth zone is where orientation practice happens. Rock gently north and south, then east and west, never exceeding a finger-width shift in any direction. Each micro orbit is a rehearsal for the precision to come. Maintain Medium pressure through the core and Light through the elbows.
Your anatomy—five to seven inches—means moderate penetration length later in practice, which gives you an advantage in control and balance. This range allows clean engagement with both anterior and posterior walls without collapse or hyperextension. For now, you’re training that same principle in plank: balance between drive and restraint. Notice how your center of gravity changes with each micro tilt. When it drifts too far forward, pressure rises through your forearms; when it shifts back, your hips lift and rhythm breaks. Your task is to find the sweet spot where all points feel evenly loaded.
If fatigue sets in, drop your knees softly to the mat while keeping the forearm angle intact. Breathe through the pause, let tension drain, and re-engage only when breath steadies. For endomorph frames, these pauses prevent joint overload and preserve clarity of movement. Treat rest as part of the rhythm, not failure. Over time, your neutral position becomes second nature—stable, strong, and ready for orbit.
When you finish this module, record a short line in your journal: “Baseline stable @60s, breath steady, no joint strain.” This note marks the first data point in your training loop, showing that your foundation is set.

======================================================================================
Module 2 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles focuses on learning the keystrokes that build the full stroke. Each keystroke is a fundamental movement your body must master before the orbits can flow together. Think of them as letters in an alphabet—you can’t write words until you know how each one feels. Begin each practice by returning to your forearm-plank baseline. Breathe in through your nose, exhale through your mouth, and feel your core settle evenly between your elbows and knees. This is where precision starts.
The first keystroke is the Lateral Rock. It trains the hips to glide side to side without twisting the spine. From baseline, inhale to prepare. As you exhale, shift your hips slowly toward the east wall, keeping both forearms pressed lightly into the mat. You’ll feel the left oblique shorten and the right lengthen. Inhale again and drift to the west wall, reversing the compression. The movement stays in the shallow 80%, Light pressure through the core, Medium through the arms. The endomorph body must watch for shoulder fatigue—if it starts, lower your hips slightly and take a full breath reset. Over time, this keystroke teaches lateral awareness and balance across the compass.
The second keystroke is the Forward Angle Press. This one introduces a Rocking quality, training the pelvis to shift forward and return without losing control. From neutral, inhale to gather strength through your abdomen. Exhale and glide your hips north as if tracing a slow arc toward the top wall. Pressure moves from Light to Medium, with the core firming to protect your spine. Only travel as far as your 80% shallow range allows; never strain for depth. For a penis size of five to seven inches, this angle later aligns with clean anterior wall contact—comfortable, full, and sustainable. When you exhale through the motion, your breath sets the rhythm; when you inhale back, you reset your center.
The third keystroke is the Drop-and-Roll Reset. This one brings Angling into play. From baseline, inhale, then exhale as you let your hips drop slightly toward the mat—south and down—before rolling them back up toward neutral. The drop creates a stretch through the lower abdomen; the roll restores pressure. Keep it in the shallow to mid 10% zone, Light pressure only. Endomorphs should pay close attention to back tension—if the lumbar area tightens, shorten the drop distance. This keystroke builds the elasticity that later turns orbits into seamless circles.
Each keystroke requires full control and clarity. The goal is not to move fast but to understand direction, pressure, and recovery. Use the SSP loop here: define what you’re training, hypothesize how it should feel, track the sensations, refine on the next rep. Observable partner cues at mastery level will include deeper breath, steady eye contact, or subtle pelvic tilt—but for now, your feedback comes from your own rhythm and breath steadiness.
Finish each session with a reset. Drop back to neutral, rest forearms, inhale fully, and exhale all tension. Journal one line after your session: “Lateral Rock@20, Forward Press@20, Drop-and-Roll smooth.” This shorthand tells you which keystrokes are becoming stable. Once they feel automatic, you’ll be ready to start building the full orbit sequence.

======================================================================================
Module 3 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles is where the keystrokes start to link together into one smooth rhythm. You are no longer just performing isolated movements—you’re beginning to feel how each one locks into the next. The goal here is to build the neural path for the orbit itself, teaching your body to move in controlled, continuous loops rather than disconnected shifts. Begin in your forearm-plank baseline. Knees down, core lightly engaged, spine long, breath calm. Inhale to feel weight balanced between elbows and knees, exhale to settle your hips into the center line. This is your launch pad.
Start with the Lateral Rock. Inhale, exhale to drift your hips to the east wall. At the far edge, pause for a heartbeat and slide into the Forward Angle Press. Keep your hips tracing the north arc as you exhale; the pelvis now glides slightly upward, pressing through Medium pressure into the north wall at the shallow 80% zone. As you reach the crest of this forward press, you’ll feel your abdomen contract naturally—don’t force it. Inhale back through center, then roll softly into the Drop-and-Roll Reset. This drop feels like a pendulum swinging southward, Light pressure, restoring the hips to baseline. The entire sequence should feel like drawing an oval on its side with your pelvis—one continuous orbit, never jerky, never rushed.
For endomorph bodies, stability is the priority. Your hips carry more weight, so your shoulders must share the load evenly. Keep your elbows pressing lightly into the mat to offload tension from your lower back. Depth control is critical; never exceed shallow 80% during these early flow tests. For a penis size of five to seven inches, you will feel a full anterior and lateral wall contact at this shallow zone, which allows you to develop rhythm without over-penetrating or compressing the cervix. The sensation should be full but smooth—her body will read it as a massage, not an impact.
As you cycle through the orbit—east to north to south—breathe with intention. Inhale through the lateral glide, exhale through the forward press, inhale through the drop reset. Each breath shift defines the tempo. This rhythm also defines her cues: deeper breathing, subtle hip lift, a small stillness before the next loop. When those appear, you know your rhythm is tuned. Reflect in real time—if her hips pull inward or her exhale extends, you’re in sync. If her breathing shortens or her body stiffens, ease pressure and return to neutral to reestablish safety and control.
Practice in short sets of ten orbits, resting after each. Endomorph structure benefits from rest hygiene—if your arms or hips start to tremble, stop, reset, and stretch the spine long. Journal your progress in one clean line, such as “Orbit@10, shallow, Medium pressure, smooth return.” This lets you track whether your transitions are even or rushed. With consistency, your nervous system will begin to map this as a natural rhythm.
Once these orbits flow cleanly without thought, you’ll be ready to test them under observation in the next phase—tracking. Ready to proceed to Module 4 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


======================================================================================
Module 4 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles brings the SSP framework fully into play. You are no longer learning the movement—you are studying it. The goal now is to apply Tracking: Define, Hypothesize, Test, and Refine within the shallow 80% zone. This phase transforms repetition into data. Each orbit becomes a study in precision, pressure, and partner response. Begin in your forearm-plank baseline. Elbows stacked under shoulders, knees lightly resting, breath deep and even. Feel the weight distributed through your core. That balance is the first thing you track.
Define what you’re testing. In this case, you’re studying smoothness of the orbit in the shallow 80%. Inhale to prepare, exhale through the Lateral Rock east to west. Keep each motion small and even. You’re feeling for drag—any catch in the hips or uneven tension across your forearms signals imbalance. Endomorph structure makes you powerful but demands patience; weight shifts can exaggerate rhythm if rushed. Use Light pressure through the arms and Medium through the core. When movement feels balanced, note that sensation mentally. That’s your first data point.
Now hypothesize. Tell yourself: “If I exhale more slowly during the forward press, I should feel smoother return control.” Then test it. Inhale, exhale through the Forward Angle Press toward the north wall, keeping the motion slow enough that the breath finishes just as you return to neutral. Observe the result. If your body glides without jerks, hypothesis confirmed. If not, shorten range or lighten pressure. The 5–7 inch length helps you stay well within shallow tolerance—never strain for depth, as doing so distorts orbit rhythm and overloads your shoulders.
Refine with micro-corrections. Use your next ten orbits as a mini-set. Inhale through the Lateral Rock, exhale through the Forward Press, inhale through Drop-and-Roll. Feel how breath length governs tempo. If your exhale shortens before the movement ends, your tempo is too fast. If you feel shoulders lifting, your core has softened; re-engage gently. The SSP method teaches that awareness is more important than endurance. The body learns most when the mind observes closely.
As you run your sets, watch for physical fatigue or heat in your shoulders. When it builds, pause and rest. Endomorph frames benefit from 20-second resets after every 10 orbits. Rest on forearms, breathe deeply, and visualize the orbit as a circle of light—steady, even, controlled. This metaphor helps anchor smooth continuity without overthinking mechanics. Return to practice only when breath is quiet again.
When you finish, record one clean line in your journal: “Tracking 80%@10, smoother exhale → balanced orbit.” That shorthand notes your tested variable and result. Over time, these entries show patterns—pressure, breath, and wall choice aligning toward mastery. Tracking builds intelligence into your movement; nothing is wasted, every loop becomes feedback.
Once you can sense and correct your own deviations in real time, you’re ready to move into sustained Flow, where motion carries its own intelligence. Ready to proceed to Module 5 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


======================================================================================
Module 5 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles is where control turns to continuity. This is the Flow phase—the body’s shift from deliberate correction to effortless rhythm. You’ve already mapped each keystroke and tested them through Tracking; now you’ll learn to let them connect in an unbroken cycle. Begin in your forearm-plank baseline, elbows under shoulders, spine neutral, breath slow and anchored. Inhale deeply to center, exhale to settle into the shallow 80% depth zone where this phase takes place. This is where smooth repetition teaches stamina, rhythm, and emotional pacing.
Start the orbit as one long breath sequence. Inhale through the Lateral Rock eastward, exhale through the Forward Angle Press north, inhale through Drop-and-Roll south. Don’t stop between these—let breath and movement blend. Each cycle is an orbit around her inner walls: east to north to south to west, back to center. The goal is to sustain at least ten full orbits without breaking baseline. For the endomorph body, stability must stay central. Keep hips level—if your lower back starts to tighten, micro-adjust by slightly widening your knee stance. That change redistributes load and preserves flow. For a penis size of five to seven inches, the shallow 80% range will feel full, smooth, and controlled without pressure spikes. This lets you sustain rhythm long enough for Flow to take over.
As Flow builds, your breathing and her breathing begin to mirror. When you exhale through the forward press, she’ll often inhale deeply or let out a soft exhale. When you inhale during the lateral rock, her hips may follow the motion slightly, rotating under you. These are confirmation cues. If her body stills or her breath deepens, maintain tempo—this means her nervous system is syncing with yours. Flow is about keeping her suspended in sensation without breaking the circuit.
Pressure stays Medium throughout. Too Light and the rhythm loses meaning; too Hard and it breaks the trance. Think of it like tracing a perfect circle on the surface of water—you want motion without splash. Endomorph stability helps here: your grounded frame gives the orbit weight, while your breath keeps it from feeling heavy. If fatigue starts creeping into shoulders or hips, shorten the orbit slightly—trim the east and west sides, focusing more on north-south movement for a few cycles. This adjustment maintains rhythm while buying recovery time.
The SSP loop now shifts from observation to refinement in motion. You are not stopping to analyze; you are testing within Flow. Ask silently, “Does this tempo hold her breath?” If yes, continue. If no, change the breath ratio—slower exhale, gentler press. Observe, tweak, test—all within motion. This is Flow intelligence.
End each session with a soft landing. Slow the orbit until hips rest at neutral. Drop your chest slightly, inhale deeply through the nose, and exhale through the mouth. Let your body settle before you rise. Journal one short note in prose: “Flow 80%, 10 cycles, Medium pressure, hips synced.” That tells you the rhythm held.
Flow teaches what control cannot—that rhythm is a form of listening. When your body moves without needing correction, awareness becomes connection. Ready to proceed to Module 6 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


======================================================================================
Module 6 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles opens the gate to depth. You’ve mastered shallow Flow in the 80% zone; now we test the deeper 10%—slowly, precisely, and only under full awareness. Deep work is not about thrusting further; it’s about layering intensity without losing rhythm. Begin in your neutral forearm plank. Inhale to lengthen the spine, exhale to settle your hips into the shallow orbit you already know. From here, every deeper movement must emerge from breath, not force.
Start with three clean orbits at shallow range to reestablish rhythm. Inhale through the Lateral Rock, exhale through the Forward Angle Press, inhale through Drop-and-Roll. On the fourth orbit, as you press north, let your hips advance slightly—no more than one thumb’s length deeper. This is your mid-zone entry, the first slice of the 10%. Keep pressure Medium and breath steady; if you feel the forward motion outpacing your exhale, stop and reset. Endomorph builds generate natural momentum, so stability is your responsibility. Keep elbows pressing lightly into the mat, core engaged, and glutes active to prevent collapse.
In this deeper zone, sensation changes. The walls feel denser and resistance more pronounced. For a penis length of five to seven inches, this is your advantage: you can reach mid-depth without striking the cervix. She will likely respond with a sharper inhale, a pelvic curl, or a stilling of movement. Those are green lights—her body saying “stay there.” If you feel her breath shorten or hips retreat, retreat yourself. Always return to shallow orbit for two full cycles before reattempting depth. That reset stabilizes both nervous systems.
Pressure can graduate to Hard only in short bursts—one or two forward presses—before easing back to Medium. Treat these deeper presses like punctuation, not paragraphs. The purpose is to stimulate her deep north wall and trigger the full-body contraction reflex, then immediately return to rhythmic orbit to soothe. Think of the motion like dipping a brush into thicker paint: deeper color, same stroke shape.
Use your breath to govern depth. Inhale on the lateral rock; exhale slowly as you move into the north press. The moment your breath finishes, your motion stops. Never move without breath. That rule protects the spine, keeps joints aligned, and ensures depth never becomes violence. When fatigue builds—shoulders tightening or hips shaking—pause fully. Endomorph joints need respect; widen the knees, rock back, stretch, and reengage only after stability returns.
End your deep-phase training with a gentle cool-down: five shallow orbits at Light pressure, long exhale, soft re-centering. The goal is to leave your nervous system calm, not amped. Journal it simply: “Depth test 10%, Medium-Hard@2 reps, clear response, safe return.” That tells you control held.
Depth work, when done correctly, doesn’t chase pleasure—it commands it. It teaches you how to wield pressure as language, how to bring weight without chaos. Ready to proceed to Module 7 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


======================================================================================
Module 7 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles teaches control after climax—the art of Pinning. This phase is where rhythm and awareness converge to create extended pleasure, both in her and in your capacity to stay present beyond the first peak. You’re learning how to use micro-adjustments in angle, pressure, and tempo to re-ignite flow instead of collapsing into stillness. Begin from your forearm-plank baseline. Inhale to stabilize, exhale to feel the weight settle evenly between your arms and core. Let your breath calm before beginning.
After climax, the body wants to drop. Resist that impulse. Stay in plank, spine straight, hips low. Inhale, lift your core slightly—just enough to relieve excess pressure—then exhale through a slow Forward Angle Press toward her north wall at Light pressure. This resets circulation and keeps connection alive. When her body softens instead of tightening, begin the first micro-correction. Shift your hips one inch east. Inhale through the Lateral Rock, exhale through a smaller orbit. You’re now working with Rocking energy more than thrusting, tracing micro-circles that stroke sensitivity back awake.
Observe her cues. A steady exhale or pelvic curl means her body is re-opening. If she goes still or her breathing shortens, pause—stay pressed lightly against the wall and simply breathe together. This still pressure, held with awareness, is the Pin. It allows her nerves to repolarize and sensations to rebuild without overstimulation. When she begins to move again, match that rhythm immediately. The goal is to spark a second wave, not force it.
Endomorph structure provides natural weight for Pinning. Use that gravity strategically. When you hold pressure on the north wall, let your hips sink only through breath—not muscular push. This prevents joint fatigue and ensures pressure stays constant. A five-to-seven-inch length allows precise wall contact without jarring depth, ideal for stimulating the midline of her cervix zone safely. During the Pin, Light to Medium pressure is optimal. When her breath deepens or her legs tighten, gradually transition into a small Flow orbit again—just two or three rotations—before returning to stillness. These brief reactivations extend arousal without draining your stamina.
Your breath anchors every decision. Inhale when lifting pressure; exhale when pressing or circling. Keep exhalations longer than inhalations—this lowers heart rate and restores control. The SSP principle of Observe → Tweak → Test guides every adjustment. You’re no longer tracking performance; you’re tracking her body’s dialogue. Observation: her hips pull in. Tweak: lighten pressure. Test: she exhales deeper—keep that.
End the sequence by returning to baseline slowly. Drop your hips, rest forearms flat, and take three long breaths. The goal is calm energy, not exhaustion. Record the result in one journal line: “Pin hold north, Light pressure, reflow@2, regained sync.” That note marks that you sustained connection past climax—a sign of mastery.
Pinning teaches restraint, presence, and attunement. It’s what separates a controlled lover from a sovereign one. Ready to proceed to Module 8 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


======================================================================================


Module 8 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles integrates everything you’ve trained—posture, keystrokes, rhythm, breath, and awareness—into a single four-week progression you can follow without lists or complexity. This is your full practice plan. The goal now is endurance through consistency, refinement through repetition, and presence through simplicity. You’re not chasing novelty anymore; you’re cultivating precision.
Each session begins the same way. Start in a neutral forearm plank with your elbows stacked beneath your shoulders, knees comfortably apart to protect the lower back. Inhale deeply through the nose, exhale through the mouth, and feel the spine lengthen. Begin with shallow orbits at Light pressure to wake the body—two minutes of soft Lateral Rocks and Forward Angle Presses just to find your breath again. As your body warms, increase to Medium pressure, establishing clean Flow across the shallow 80% zone. These opening sets are where your nervous system remembers the language of movement.
In the first week, focus entirely on posture and breath. Your goal is to maintain plank stability and breath synchronization for five-minute intervals without collapsing or arching your spine. Endomorph bodies can use their weight to advantage here; ground your hips and feel that mass as stability, not burden. If fatigue builds in the shoulders, shorten your stance and return to Light pressure. Each rep is about clarity—can you feel every wall distinctly? Journal one sentence after each session: “Baseline held, 80%, Medium pressure, smooth cycles.”
In the second week, begin chaining keystrokes deliberately—Lateral Rock into Forward Angle Press, then Drop-and-Roll back to center. Flow for ten full orbits at Medium pressure, exhaling through each forward press. This trains rhythmic memory. Your penis length of five to seven inches will reach all key zones without strain; maintain the 80–10–10 depth logic to preserve rhythm integrity. You can test mid-depth entry once per session, exhaling through the motion, but always return to shallow Flow immediately afterward.
By the third week, endurance becomes the focus. Aim for longer Flow sets—three to five minutes uninterrupted—without sacrificing angle accuracy. When breath syncs perfectly, your motion will feel almost circular, like painting with your hips. Keep the compass consistent: east-south-west-north and back. If her breath deepens or she quiets, stay steady; that’s Flow intelligence. Rest when needed—Endomorph frames require joint recovery. Stretch the wrists, hips, and lower back before continuing.
In the final week, integrate the Pinning strategy. After your Flow sessions, finish with two minutes of post-climax awareness work. Light pressure, slow Rocking, matched breath. Inhale through release, exhale through gentle return. Use the SSP principle in real time: observe her cues, tweak angle, test subtle pressure changes, and record your findings in one clean journal sentence: “Pin hold north, Light, reflow sustained.” This teaches your body how to maintain presence even when intensity fades.
Across these four weeks, you are forging rhythm mastery. The stroke ceases to be a pattern and becomes a state of precision. Your body learns the geometry of pleasure, your breath teaches endurance, and your control creates emotional gravity. Maintain neutral baselines, honor depth gates, and stay aware of the difference between weight and strain. Over time, The Egyptian Orbiting Circles becomes not just movement—it becomes your signature rhythm.
