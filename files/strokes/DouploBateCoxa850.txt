Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke! I’m Coach [Your Name], and it’s an honor to work with you—a powerful endomorph with an extension above 7 inches. Your robust, full‑figured frame is built for endurance and raw power, providing an exceptionally stable base for every movement. With your above‑7‑inch extension, you have a wide stimulation field at your disposal. However, this increased reach also means that every motion must be executed with meticulous precision to ensure that the majority of your applied force is focused on the most sensitive, shallow zone without overwhelming the deeper tissues.
Before we begin, take a moment to create your personal training sanctuary—a quiet, comfortable space where you can focus completely without distractions. Sit or lie down, relax your broad shoulders, and take several deep, slow breaths until your mind is clear and your body is ready to perform. Today’s session is about transforming your natural, heavy‑set power into a carefully choreographed sequence of movements that translates raw strength into a rhythmic, scientifically optimized intimate performance.
We start by modifying the classic missionary position to suit your stable, endomorphic build. Begin in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface. This foundational stance is critical—it anchors your robust body, ensuring that every micro‑movement is executed with deliberate, controlled precision. Once firmly grounded, insert your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This precise insertion sets the blueprint for the stroke, determining how the force will be distributed during each movement.
Your first action is a smooth and controlled forward push. Slowly move your entire body forward—northward toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, the top shelf of your extended penis glides gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head maintains continuous, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, it is absolutely essential that you focus the majority of your stimulation on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. We do this by strictly applying the 80‑10‑10 principle: roughly 80% of your applied force should target the shallow zone (approximately the first 1–3 inches) while the remaining 20% is divided equally between the mid‑depth (around 3–5 inches) and the deep zones (beyond 5 inches). This careful force distribution is fundamental to optimizing stimulation exactly where it is most effective.
After the forward push, the stroke transitions into the lateral phase. Your robust, full‑figured endomorphic stability provides you with the necessary balance to execute controlled lateral movements with ease. You will begin by lowering your left hip slowly toward the canvas. As you do so, the hilt (base) of your penis applies steady, focused pressure along the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right. This reorientation creates friction and generates a gentle, upward rocking massage along her right wall. Then, you raise your left hip back toward center in a smooth reversal that resets the force. In the Douplo variation, after you complete the entire left‑side sequence, you mirror the same series of movements on the right side—ensuring that the entire vaginal canal receives balanced, cumulative stimulation.
This introduction lays the foundation for transforming your natural, endomorphic power and your above‑7‑inch extension into a performance that is scientifically controlled and intimately effective. Every forward push, every lateral drop and raise, and every reset is executed with deliberate precision to ensure the sensitive shallow zone is the focus while still maintaining overall stimulation balance. Welcome, brother—let’s begin converting your raw potential into an artful expression of intimate mastery with the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re going to delve deeply into the foundational principles that form the backbone of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. These concepts ensure that every movement you make is executed with scientific precision and cumulative efficiency. Let’s break each one down.
The 80‑10‑10 Principle At its core, the 80‑10‑10 principle is all about how you distribute your applied force during your stroke. You concentrate approximately 80% of your force on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches—which is densely populated with nerve endings and, therefore, the most sensitive area. The remaining 20% of your force is divided evenly between the mid‑depth (roughly 3–5 inches) and the deep zones (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an endomorph with an extension above 7 inches, this principle is critical because while you have the reach to stimulate deeper areas, the greatest pleasure is to be found in that compact, nerve‑rich shallow zone. Every forward push, lateral drop, and reset must be executed with deliberate control so that most of your energy is focused where it yields the maximum response.
The Sexual Scientific Process This process is an iterative, scientific method for refining your technique. It consists of four key steps:
Define Your Goal: Clearly state what you want to achieve with each stroke. For example, you might aim for maximum friction along the left side during a lateral drop.
Form a Hypothesis: Based on your initial practice and feedback, predict what slight modifications—such as adjusting the pace or angle of your hip drop—might yield enhanced cumulative stimulation.
Track: Methodically perform a high number of repetitions (ideally at least 30 strokes per vaginal “wall”) while carefully recording your internal cues (such as core engagement and pelvic floor activation) as well as your partner’s responses (her breathing patterns, subtle body movements, and verbal cues).
Flow: Once you determine the variation that consistently produces optimal results, commit to that rhythmic, automatic sequence. When you’re in flow, every micro‑movement connects seamlessly and maintains the perfect balance dictated by the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Tracking Tracking is all about collecting detailed, actionable feedback from your performance. As you perform the stroke, observe and record your partner’s responses and how your body feels. This systematic data gathering allows you to fine‑tune each element, ensuring that the cumulative stimulation is always optimized.
Flow Flow is the state in which your movements become completely automatic and fluid. After repeated practice and careful tracking, you will achieve a natural rhythm where every forward push, lateral drop, and backward shuttle occurs without conscious effort. In this state, the 80‑10‑10 distribution is maintained perfectly and your stroke becomes a continuous, cumulative performance.
The Tap Keystroke The tap keystroke is a foundational drill for mastering lateral movement. To perform it, begin in a stable position—typically a forearm plank—then shift laterally until your hip gently “taps” the supporting surface, and then return smoothly to the center. This small, controlled movement builds muscle memory and strengthens your pelvic floor, especially when coordinated with deep breathing (often called stroke breathing) and kegeling exercises. Mastery of the tap keystroke ensures that your lateral movements in the stroke are executed with precision, allowing you to maintain optimal force distribution and cumulative stimulation.
Together, these principles—the precise force targeting of the 80‑10‑10 principle, the systematic refinement via the Sexual Scientific Process (tracking and achieving flow), and the mastery of the tap keystroke—form the backbone of your training. They guarantee that each movement in the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke is deliberate, cumulative, and effective. With these concepts firmly understood, you’re ready to move on to deconstructing the stroke into its fundamental components.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into its individual components. Remember, this stroke operates in two distinct phases: it first runs through a complete sequence on the left side, and then it mirrors that exact sequence on the right side. As an endomorph with an extension above 7 inches, you have the power and stability to deliver forceful, deliberate movements—but your compact extension means that every micro‑movement must be executed with precision. Here’s your detailed blueprint:
Left‑Side Sequence:
Forward Movement: Start by inserting your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle. Then, execute a smooth forward push by moving your entire body slowly northward toward your partner’s head. During this phase, the top shelf of your extension glides gracefully over her clitoral region and the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” According to the 80‑10‑10 principle, approximately 80% of your force should target the shallow, nerve‑rich zone (the first 1–3 inches), ensuring that maximum stimulation is concentrated in the most responsive area.
Lateral Phase – Left Hip Drop: Immediately following the forward push, initiate the lateral phase on the left side by slowly dropping your left hip toward the canvas. As you drop, the hilt of your penis applies focused, steady pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right, generating friction and a gentle, upward rocking massage along her right wall—from the eastern section upward toward the northern section. This precise lateral drop is executed using the tap keystroke, ensuring that the majority of your force remains focused on the shallow zone while adding cumulative stimulation.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Left‑Side Reversal): Immediately after the lateral drop, raise your left hip back to the center in a smooth, controlled motion. In this reversal, the hilt now applies force from the western section toward the northern section, while your penis reorients to point directly north, producing a gentle upward massage from the northern wall to the eastern wall. This controlled raise is critical to integrate the stimulation from the lateral phase and maintain a rhythmic flow.
Cycle Repetition (Left Side): Repeat the left‑side sequence several times to build cumulative stimulation. You may introduce variations in pace—for example, executing a faster half‑raise before a full drop—to modulate friction and dynamic pressure. These controlled variations create a rhythmic “W” pattern on the left side, ensuring that the force distribution remains balanced and that the stimulation is cumulative.
Right‑Side Mirrored Sequence: After completing the left‑side sequence, mirror the exact same movements on the right side:
Forward Movement: Reset with a forward push identical to the left‑side sequence—ensuring that the top shelf again glides over her clitoral region while the head stays in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall,” all while maintaining the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Lateral Phase – Right Hip Drop: Now focus on the right. Execute a controlled lateral shift by dropping your right hip toward the canvas. In this mirror movement, the hilt applies steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the left—delivering friction and a gentle rocking massage along her left wall, from the western section upward toward the northern section.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Right‑Side Reversal): Immediately raise your right hip back to center in a controlled manner. Here, the hilt’s pressure moves from the eastern section upward to the northern section, with your penis reorienting to point straight north, providing an upward massage from the northern wall toward the western wall.
Cycle Repetition (Right Side): Repeat the right‑side lateral drop and raise sequence several times so that the stimulation is balanced and cumulative across both sides of the vaginal canal.
The entire Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke is completed when the left‑side sequence is executed fully and then immediately mirrored on the right side, creating a balanced, rhythmic “W” pattern that delivers cumulative stimulation in perfect harmony with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as your breath. With your robust, full‑figured endomorphic build and an extension above 7 inches, precision and controlled strength are paramount. In this module, we will engage in repetitive, focused practice of every segmented movement—starting with the forward push, then isolating the left‑side lateral drop (using the tap keystroke), followed by controlled hip raising, and finishing with the backward shuttle. After you have mastered these drills on the left side, you will mirror them on the right side.
Forward Movement Drill: Begin by assuming your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a sturdy surface that supports your heavy‑set frame. Insert your penis at the exact downward diagonal angle, and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation as the top shelf of your extended asset glides gracefully over her clitoral region, and ensure the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, it’s critical that about 80% of your force is directed to the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone. Execute this forward push slowly and deliberately, repeating it several times until the motion is fluid and consistent.
Left‑Side Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a small, controlled lateral movement until it gently taps the supporting surface. Visualize how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along her right wall. Synchronize each lateral tap with deep, controlled breathing: inhale deeply before initiating the drop, and exhale slowly as you complete the tap. Incorporate kegeling exercises during each tap to further enhance precision. Drill this lateral movement repeatedly, aiming for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on the left side until it becomes an automatic part of your muscle memory.
Right‑Side Lateral Tap Drill (Mirrored Tap Keystroke): Next, mirror the lateral tap drill on the right side. From your forward position, carefully drop your right hip until it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Visualize the hilt applying steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left, producing a similar rhythmic rocking massage on her left wall. Synchronize this movement with controlled breathing and integrate kegeling for extra precision. Repeat for at least 30 repetitions on the right side until it becomes second nature.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: Following the lateral tap drills on both sides, focus on the lowering phase. After each lateral tap, slowly lower your dropped hip until it gently contacts the supporting surface. Concentrate on how the underbelly of your penis begins to apply cumulative, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf maintains consistent contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle—retract your body in a controlled fashion so that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall as you reset your position without fully withdrawing. Repeat the entire sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times on each side until every transition is smooth and precisely adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout your drilling sessions, maintain deep, deliberate breathing. Allow each deep inhale to focus your attention and prepare your body for the next movement, while each controlled exhale ensures a seamless transition between phases. With disciplined, consistent practice, your robust endomorphic strength and extended reach will fuse into a series of movements executed with flawless precision and cumulative intensity.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the true art of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, core fully engaged, and your mind laser‑focused on creating a fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this module, you will combine your forward push, left‑side lateral taps (using the tap keystroke), controlled left‑side hip raises, and backward shuttle into one unified cycle, then mirror those movements exactly on the right side.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward—moving steadily north toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extended penis continuously glides over her clitoral region and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push establishes the foundation for cumulative stimulation and must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, focusing roughly 80% of your force on the shallow zone.
Immediately, transition into the lateral phase on the left side. Execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip using the tap keystroke. Focus intently on how the hilt applies targeted pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along her right wall. Once these left‑side taps are complete, smoothly raise your left hip back to center to reset the pressure, then perform a deliberate backward shuttle to return to your starting position, ensuring your penis stays in constant contact with her north wall.
Without hesitation, mirror the entire sequence on the right side. From your starting position, perform another forward push (maintaining the same 80‑10‑10 distribution), then execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your right hip until it taps the surface—this time, the hilt applies steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your penis rotates so its inner surface points to the left, producing a gentle rocking massage on her left wall. After the right‑side taps, smoothly raise your right hip back to center and execute a controlled backward shuttle.
This alternating “walking” motion—left‑side sequence followed by a mirrored right‑side sequence—creates a rhythmic “W” pattern that delivers balanced cumulative stimulation across the vaginal canal, all while strictly following the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated routine, allow your deep, rhythmic breathing to serve as your internal metronome—inhale deeply to prime your body for the next movement, and exhale steadily to facilitate smooth transitions. With every complete cycle, your robust endomorphic strength and extended reach merge into one continuous, fluid performance—a Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke that is as scientifically refined as it is intimately effective.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our focus is on fine‑tuning every micro‑adjustment of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your robust, full‑figured endomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every movement must be executed with impeccable precision to honor the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that around 80% of your applied force is concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone while the remaining 20% is evenly distributed between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, pay close attention to every nuance of your performance. During the forward push, verify that the top shelf of your extended penis glides consistently over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you execute your lateral taps using the tap keystroke on both sides, observe the subtle rocking motions produced by your controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is above 7 inches, even the slightest variation in the angle or pace of your hip drop can significantly impact the cumulative stimulation. Experiment with minor adjustments—a one or two degree change in your hip drop or a slight modification in the pace—and carefully note how these tweaks alter the pressure distribution and rocking effect. Rely on your partner’s feedback—her deep, rhythmic breathing, soft verbal cues, and even subtle body shifts—as critical data points in refining your technique. This iterative process of defining your goals, forming a hypothesis, tracking the outcomes, and fine‑tuning your technique is at the heart of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout every cycle. Every deep inhale should focus your energy and prime your body for the next micro‑movement, while each controlled exhale ensures a smooth, natural transition between phases. Over repeated cycles, as you consistently track your internal signals (such as core engagement and pelvic floor contractions) along with your partner’s subtle responses, you’ll achieve a state of flow—a seamless, automatic performance in which every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with impeccable precision and cumulative intensity. When you reach this state, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will be a continuous, rhythmic expression of scientifically optimized, cumulative stimulation.
Remember, brother, that every tiny adjustment matters. Your robust, full‑figured endomorphic build and extended asset provide a powerful base for delivering intensely focused stimulation—but only if every micro‑movement is executed with perfect consistency and precision. Continuously track your internal sensations and your partner’s cues, and refine your technique until your stroke evolves into a naturally flowing performance that is both scientifically refined and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to create your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen designed to reinforce every element of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke while also strengthening the core and overall stability essential for your robust, full‑figured endomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your detailed roadmap for converting your natural power into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically optimized stimulation.
Begin by establishing your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary free from distractions where you can focus solely on mastering your technique. Every training session should begin with a comprehensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your endomorphic physique. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back; these muscle groups provide the critical support necessary for executing every precise micro‑movement in the stroke. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, priming every muscle and joint for the detailed work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for your training session.
Next, dive into specialized drills targeting each component of the stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees securely planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Synchronize every lateral movement with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale deeply before initiating each shift and exhale slowly as you complete it. To further enhance precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each tap. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the motion is fully ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve honed your lateral drills, integrate them with the vertical components. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and then a smooth, gradual backward shuttle—ensuring that every micro‑movement strictly follows the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this full integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition flows seamlessly. To further boost your stability and precise control, supplement your stroke‑specific drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises, such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills, which are critical for maintaining both balance and exact control during your performance. Finally, keep a detailed training journal where you record each session—the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you experiment with, and the feedback you receive from your partner. This journal is an indispensable component of the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to monitor your progress and continuously refine your technique.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent practice, you’ll transform your natural, robust endomorphic strength and extended asset into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of your disciplined practice, where your robust, full‑figured endomorphic build and your penis between 5 and 7 inches converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core engaged, and your mind entirely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your penis consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, concentrating about 80% of your force on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone, while the remaining force is delicately balanced to engage the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately, transition into the lateral phase on one side by executing the tap keystroke with your right hip (or left, depending on which side you begin with). Drop your hip in a small, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps, ensuring that the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along the appropriate side of her vaginal opening while your penis rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. If any lateral tap appears inconsistent—due to uneven pressure or a slight misalignment—pause, isolate that movement, and drill it repeatedly until your internal feedback and your partner’s subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced per the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, focus on your core contraction and the engagement of your pelvic floor, and listen closely to any subtle cues from your partner—her measured breathing or soft verbal affirmations are vital. This troubleshooting stage is crucial; if you notice any deficiency in cumulative stimulation, make slight adjustments—perhaps a subtle tweak in your lateral angle or a minor change in the pace of your forward push—and meticulously track the outcome using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the entire cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation throughout the vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you reach that state, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will stand as a testament to your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate finesse—a continuous, fluid performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated training into a true art form—a performance in which every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your robust, full‑figured endomorphic strength and moderate extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure with every move. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke bring you ever closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
