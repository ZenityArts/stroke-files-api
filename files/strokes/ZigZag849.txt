Module 1 for the Zig Zag stroke is about orientation and body setup—how to hold forearm-plank posture so your joints stay safe, your stamina lasts, and your wall contact stays precise. Begin on the canvas with your knees spread to a comfortable width, toes pointed back, and forearms grounded beneath your shoulders. Your spine stays long, your hips in line with your shoulders, and your head relaxed in a neutral gaze forward. This is your clean baseline. Inhale through your nose to build structure, then exhale through your mouth as your core tightens and your hips settle. This posture keeps your weight distributed evenly through your forearms and thighs, sparing your lower back and shoulders. For an endomorphic body, this alignment uses your mass as support rather than strain; it lets you stay steady without collapsing through the chest. At 5–7 inches, this setup ensures that when you enter, your depth aligns naturally to the shallow 80% zone where sensitivity and stamina meet.
Now breathe three slow cycles in this position to feel your weight settle. Notice how a small Rocking motion—a gentle drop of the hips toward the canvas and rise back to baseline—activates your pelvic hinge without shifting your upper body. This is your fundamental movement cue for the Zig Zag. Each exhale lowers you slightly; each inhale lifts you back. The rhythm teaches your nervous system to connect breath and motion before any penetration happens. This is your practice for clarity—building body memory so that later, when you perform the stroke, your angles stay deliberate instead of reactive.
Once stable, visualize your compass inside her body: north wall at the top, south wall below, east and west diagonals along her sides. Your task is to stimulate the north wall while keeping pressure controlled and contact constant. During training, maintain shallow 80% engagement. This ensures safety and precision while preventing fatigue. The endomorphic frame benefits here because you can use your grounded weight to maintain consistent contact without overusing your shoulders. A helpful metaphor is to imagine ironing a smooth line—you press, glide, lift, and reset—never jabbing or forcing the fabric. This image keeps the pressure steady and directional.
From this baseline, test micro Angling. Shift your hips five to ten degrees east, then back to center, exhaling through each glide. The movement is small and slow, meant to teach control of rotation around your axis. Each inhale recenters your hips; each exhale explores a direction. When you angle correctly, you’ll feel the pressure glide across one ridge of contact. Later this will become the Shuttle component of the Zig Zag. For now, it’s about awareness—feeling how rotation changes sensation without changing depth.
During these drills, your partner’s cues tell you if the pressure is correct. A deep breath or soft exhale means she’s receiving well. A still body or tightening signals that the angle or pressure needs refining. If you see that, return to neutral and take one slow inhale before continuing. Use your SSP loop here: Define your neutral, Hypothesize a small angle shift, Track her reaction, and Refine your next motion. This trains responsiveness and keeps your rhythm intelligent instead of mechanical.
Throughout this module, watch your joint load. For an endomorphic body, fatigue can build in the shoulders if the elbows drift forward. Keep them stacked directly under your shoulders and use your core to carry weight. If the lower back arches, draw your navel in slightly and tuck your pelvis forward until your hips and shoulders align again. Every minute or two, lift back into full neutral plank and breathe deeply to release tension. These short resets protect your joints and preserve your ability to sense feedback clearly.
By the end of this orientation, you should feel stable in forearm plank, clear about your compass, and comfortable with shallow Rocking and light Angling. Each movement begins and ends at neutral, driven by breath and anchored through posture. This foundation makes later depth and lateral motion safe, consistent, and precise. A simple journal reflection for today could read, “Neutral plank steady, shallow Rocking smooth, Medium pressure, even breath through three reps.” This one line captures position, depth, pressure, and breath control.
When you can hold forearm plank for at least five steady breaths without tension and perform light Rocking and Angling while keeping contact stable, you’re ready to advance. The goal is not speed or endurance yet—it’s clarity of motion, clean alignment, and consistent awareness of her cues.

=======================================================================================


Module 2 for the Zig Zag stroke teaches you how to isolate and train each keystroke that forms the foundation of the stroke’s rhythm. Every motion builds from the same clean forearm-plank baseline you established in Module 1. You begin steady—elbows under shoulders, hips aligned, core engaged—and each movement grows from that neutrality. The first keystroke is the Drop Rock. From neutral, inhale to lengthen your spine and exhale as your hips drop toward the canvas, letting your body weight carry the head of your penis downward into the shallow 80% zone on her north wall. The action is Rocking only—no angle yet. Pressure stays light to medium, just enough to feel steady contact through the upper ridge. For an endomorphic body, your mass naturally helps sustain this gentle weight; resist the urge to press harder. With a 5–7-inch length, this zone ensures consistent wall stimulation without bottoming. Her cues will show instantly if the depth is right—a slower breath, eyes closed, a faint pelvic curl toward you. If she tightens or pulls away, hold neutral for one breath and resume with softer entry. This first keystroke is your Tracking phase anchor—it teaches sensitivity and depth control.
When you’ve mastered the Drop Rock, the next keystroke is the Lateral Shuttle east. Staying at shallow depth, keep pressure along the top shelf of the penis and glide your hips five to ten degrees to your right. The movement blends Rocking and Angling; you pivot gently on your forearms while your hips slide laterally, tracing the north-northeast diagonal inside her. Exhale during the glide, inhale on return. The pressure remains medium and steady, maintaining constant friction along the same wall. Your goal is not distance but precision—your body weight shifts laterally, never forward or backward. For an endomorphic build, focus on arm coordination; push slightly through the left forearm to guide your hips right, keeping chest stable. This prevents fatigue in your lower back. She’ll often exhale softly or let her hips roll with you when the pressure lands correctly. If her breath hitches or her thighs tense, reduce the range and lighten pressure.
From that position, perform the return Shuttle west. This motion mirrors the previous glide, carrying the head and top shelf of the penis back along the north-northwest diagonal. Exhale as you move left, inhale on the reset to center. The key here is symmetry—maintaining even tempo, pressure, and depth while alternating direction. The movement again combines Rocking and Angling but remains anchored by your core, not your shoulders. Keep your elbows heavy, your spine long, and your breath smooth. This keystroke deepens Flow phase readiness by training rhythm and lateral endurance. For your body type, small controlled slides are more efficient than long reaches; they protect your joints and let you practice longer without overheating. Her feedback may be a longer exhale or a subtle pressing upward of the pelvis—signs to maintain your current pattern.
Next is the Lift Reset, the keystroke that gives you endurance and clarity. After a few lateral passes, inhale and raise your hips slightly while keeping the tip just inside her entrance. This motion is pure Rocking, done lightly. It relieves tension from your shoulders, reoxygenates your forearms, and allows both bodies to breathe. The Lift Reset belongs to the Tracking phase and keeps your nervous system sensitive rather than numb from repetition. Pressure is light, depth retreats fully to shallow 80%, and breath flows slowly. For endomorphs, this reset is essential—it prevents overloading the lower spine by redistributing mass back through your core. When she responds with a sigh or her body softens, it means your rhythm’s integrity remains intact. If she stiffens or seems to lose presence, pause in neutral plank for one breath before continuing.
Finally, practice the Deep Drop Extension sparingly to test depth control. From a mid-cycle glide, exhale and allow your hips to drop one inch deeper toward the mid 10% zone while keeping the same north-wall angle. This teaches pressure calibration and prepares for later modules that explore mid-depth Flow. Maintain medium pressure only—never Hard—and return to shallow after one breath. The shorter 5–7-inch length gives you just enough reach to stimulate midline without strain. For endomorphs, use your breath to manage mass: exhale as you drop, engage the core to stabilize the return. She’ll usually meet you with a low moan or pelvic draw if the depth aligns. If she pulls back or stills, lift out immediately and rest in neutral.
Together these keystrokes—Drop Rock, Shuttle east, Shuttle west, Lift Reset, and Deep Drop Extension—are the full inventory of the Zig Zag stroke. Practicing them individually trains your nervous system to read subtle resistance, manage stamina, and stay attuned to feedback. Every keystroke begins and ends at neutral, governed by breath and baseline stability. The metaphor here is polishing a curved line: each pass smooths sensation, each reset restores clarity. A journal line might read, “North wall glide east-west, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, steady exhale, hips stable.” This captures compass, depth, pressure, and feedback in a single sentence for tracking progress.
By the end of this module, each keystroke should feel deliberate and controllable. You’re not yet chaining them into full rhythm; you’re training precision—the muscular literacy that makes the Zig Zag feel effortless later. When your transitions between Drop, Shuttle, and Reset are clean, you’re ready to combine them into continuous motion. Ready to proceed to Module 3 for Zig Zag with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=======================================================================================




Module 3 for the Zig Zag stroke teaches you how to weave the keystrokes into a full rhythm. Each motion must connect seamlessly, using breath and baseline alignment as the thread. You begin from the same neutral forearm plank—elbows grounded, hips aligned, spine long. Inhale to lengthen, exhale to settle your weight and feel her warmth receive you. This baseline is the origin point for every loop of the Zig Zag. The Drop Rock starts the rhythm: a soft exhale lowers your hips, pressing the head of your penis downward into her shallow north wall. Let your body weight, not muscle force, create the contact. The key is grounded ease—Rocking through the core, not thrusting through the legs. When the Drop Rock lands well, she breathes deeper or curls her hips slightly upward. That’s your green light to begin the lateral flow.
From the bottom of the Drop Rock, you transition smoothly into the Lateral Shuttle east. Keep the depth shallow at 80%, pressure medium, and the contact constant along the top shelf. Use your left forearm as a brace and let your hips glide east on the exhale. The movement should feel like sliding warmth across her north ridge, the top shelf of your penis tracing that line while your core keeps rhythm. Inhale to pause in the east position, feel her breath shift, then exhale to begin the return Shuttle west. The movement mirrors the first glide but crosses the opposite diagonal. Each glide is one breath out, each return one breath in. The alternating pattern creates the “zig” and “zag,” a rhythm that stimulates her north wall from side to side without losing grounding.
As the rhythm forms, the Lift Reset becomes your checkpoint. After several lateral cycles, inhale fully, lift your hips an inch to lighten contact, and hold that breath. This pause resets alignment and refreshes your body. Exhale as you lower again into the next Drop Rock. The Lift Reset is your endurance tool—it prevents numb repetition and keeps every new cycle precise. Think of it as the comma in a sentence: a pause that makes the meaning clearer. Without it, the stroke becomes blur; with it, the rhythm breathes. For your endomorphic build, this reset is essential—it redistributes load from the shoulders and lets you recover core balance before the next phase.
Now integrate the Deep Drop Extension into every third or fourth cycle. When her breath grows longer or her hips press in, exhale and sink one inch deeper into mid 10% depth. The motion stays slow and smooth, never abrupt. The goal isn’t to reach farther but to enrich the texture of the stroke—to give her body a contrast between shallow glides and brief midline depth. The moment you sense her breath catch or her hips still, withdraw gently to shallow, inhale to stabilize, and resume the next lateral pass. At your 5–7-inch length, this measured approach ensures precision and safety; you stimulate depth through angle and consistency, not penetration force.
Your breath should now drive the entire rhythm. Each inhale prepares the body, stabilizing your plank and re-centering your compass. Each exhale powers the Rock or the glide, releasing weight through your hips and into her body. The ratio of movement to breath should stay one-to-one: one exhale for each directional action, one inhale for each reset or return. The SSP loop continues in the background—you define neutral, test each cycle, track her cues, refine your next motion. This keeps awareness alive instead of mechanical. If she exhales softly and her pelvis follows your rhythm, stay in that cadence. If her breathing shortens or she stiffens, pause in Lift Reset and observe before resuming.
The metaphor here is brushwork. You’re painting a long horizontal stroke with the same steady pressure each time, guided by breath. Too fast, and the line breaks. Too hard, and the texture smears. When you keep rhythm through relaxed control, she feels your movement as seamless stimulation—no edges, no loss of contact, only continuous flow across her north wall. Each pass blends Rocking and Angling so that sensation spreads instead of striking.
For your endomorphic body, keep the range compact—ten degrees of lateral travel is plenty. The narrower motion helps protect the lumbar curve and uses your mass efficiently for pressure. With a 5–7-inch length, maintain shallow consistency and let the diagonals do the stimulation work. Your journal entry for this session might read, “Zig east-west three reps, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, inhale center, exhale glide, hips stable.” This note captures the rhythm logic for SSP tracking.
When the sequence feels natural, slow your pace and focus on transitions—the handoff between Drop Rock, Shuttle east, Shuttle west, and Lift Reset. Each one should begin and end with breath awareness and a brief return to neutral. You’ll know the stroke is built when the movement feels like one continuous body wave rather than separate steps. At that point, rhythm, breath, and awareness have merged. Ready to proceed to Module 4 for Zig Zag with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=======================================================================================




Module 4 for the Zig Zag stroke brings you into the Tracking phase—the phase where precision and awareness meet. You are not chasing speed or intensity yet; you are gathering data. Begin again in neutral forearm plank, elbows under shoulders, spine long, hips steady above your knees. Inhale through your nose to lock in posture, exhale through your mouth as your hips sink slightly, feeling contact return to her north wall. This is your starting anchor for shallow 80% exploration. The goal here is to define your cleanest wall contact and learn how her feedback shapes your adjustments.
Start the session with three Drop Rocks, light and slow. Inhale on the rise, exhale through each descent, maintaining soft, steady pressure. Keep awareness at the tip, noticing where the north wall resists and where it welcomes. The endomorphic frame naturally lends weight; this helps you stay grounded but demands precision. Your mass must sink, not press. Imagine resting into the wall rather than pushing through it. Each descent should feel like water pooling evenly, never splashing. When you reach stable contact, shift into your first Shuttle east glide. Exhale as you slide right, maintaining the same shallow depth and Medium pressure. Inhale to return to center, then exhale to Shuttle west. The rhythm is a breathing loop: out-right, in-center, out-left, in-center.
As you move, track her cues under the SSP loop. Define what a good reaction looks like—a deepening breath, a soft exhale, hips pressing in slightly. Form a hypothesis about what caused it—angle, depth, or tempo. Run a mini-set of five cycles testing one variable only, such as a two-degree increase in lateral glide. Observe her body’s response. If she exhales longer or arches gently upward, the adjustment is successful. If she tightens, shortens her breath, or shifts away, refine by returning to the previous range. The point is not to please her but to build your sensory literacy—learning to interpret her cues in real time and translate them into precise mechanical changes.
Maintain this investigative rhythm through your breath. Each exhale is a test, each inhale a data capture. Keep pressure steady through the top shelf of the penis, focusing on how friction texture changes as you move laterally. In the shallow 80%, her tissue is responsive but not defensive—this is where you learn her architecture. Endomorphic stability is a gift here; your weight keeps you in contact without strain. Just watch your shoulders—if tension creeps upward, draw your navel in and lengthen your spine until the shoulders soften. This keeps you efficient and able to sense small variations in pressure.
After about ten breath cycles, perform a Lift Reset to release tension and review findings. Inhale fully, raise hips slightly, and hold. Feel your heartbeat through your forearms; this is your data pause. Reflect for one breath: which direction gave smoother glide? Which pressure evoked stillness or deeper breath from her? Whisper these findings internally—“east holds, medium pressure, long exhale”—then lower and continue testing. This reflection turns your movement into method, your touch into science.
In Tracking, tempo matters less than clarity. Each Shuttle glide should feel like slow handwriting, each pass legible and intentional. Use the metaphor of tracing letters in sand—the gentler your stroke, the clearer the shape remains. When you rush or press too hard, the line collapses. Stay slow enough that you can feel every grain of resistance, every shift in her breath pattern. That’s how you calibrate for future Flow.
Because your body type carries mass through the hips, your greatest advantage is steadiness. Let your weight float through the forearms and abdomen, never collapsing into the lower back. Your 5–7-inch length is ideal for shallow tracking; it gives you tactile precision without the risk of overdepth. Keep depth gating strict—never exceed mid 10% until Flow cues invite it. If she pulls you in or arches upward, log it as a potential signal for deeper work later, but return to shallow to maintain control.
At the end of each set, rest in neutral plank and exhale fully. Record your observations in one line: “North wall, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, east glide stronger reaction, breath deepened.” This captures the SSP loop: hypothesis, observation, refinement. Over time, these notes reveal her pattern map—her most receptive angles and pressure windows. Tracking is how mastery begins, and mastery is what turns repetition into language.
When you can move through five minutes of Tracking without losing posture, breath rhythm, or awareness of her feedback, the Zig Zag stroke is ready to shift toward continuous Flow. Ready to proceed to Module 5 for Zig Zag with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=======================================================================================




Module 5 for the Zig Zag stroke brings you into the Flow phase, where rhythm becomes seamless and breath drives every movement. You’ve already built mechanical precision through Tracking—now your task is to surrender to the rhythm without losing form. Begin again in the forearm plank, elbows firm under your shoulders, knees grounded, hips hovering in alignment with her pelvis. Inhale through your nose, feel your ribs expand, then exhale through your mouth as your hips descend into shallow 80% depth, letting the head of your penis find the north wall. The Flow phase begins here—not with a thrust, but with a continuous glide powered by steady breathing.
Your first Drop Rock acts as ignition. On the exhale, drop your hips smoothly, feeling the top ridge of your penis roll along her north wall. Keep pressure medium and evenly distributed. Inhale to lift slightly, only an inch, then exhale again to lower and glide east. The Shuttle east becomes the first “zig.” Use your left forearm to anchor and guide the hips right, keeping the spine long and weight balanced. Your exhale carries the glide; your inhale returns you to center. As soon as you feel her exhale softly or her hips tilt upward, you know the angle is alive. Continue into the Shuttle west, mirroring the same breath and tempo. The “zag” balances the rhythm—an equal and opposite glide that massages the north-northwest diagonal.
When the cycle feels smooth, let the Lift Reset occur naturally between sequences. Inhale to raise the hips slightly, hold for half a breath, and exhale into the next Drop Rock. This subtle elevation keeps your Flow sustainable, allowing oxygen to circulate and resetting your internal compass. Think of this as a heartbeat rhythm: Drop Rock is the beat, Shuttles are the pulse, Lift Reset is the recovery. Your breath keeps time. In Flow, you no longer isolate these keystrokes—they fuse into a continuous loop, creating a wave that she can ride.
At this phase, your sensitivity becomes your navigation system. Her cues are your feedback: a deepening breath, a steady pelvic curl, a quiet moan, or a stilling body are all signs you’re locked onto her receptive angle. When her breath and yours align, Flow has been achieved. If her body tightens, breath shortens, or she starts to withdraw, pause in a Lift Reset, inhale fully, and resume at a slower tempo with lighter pressure. Flow is about adaptation—it’s awareness in motion.
Keep your range tight and your pressure consistent. For an endomorphic build, compact movement preserves stamina and spine alignment. Glide within a narrow ten-degree arc; this keeps your rhythm sustainable and prevents joint overload. Your weight gives you natural pressure, so let gravity replace muscular effort. For a 5–7-inch length, maintain the shallow 80% depth; the diagonals themselves create the sensation of fullness. Never chase deeper penetration—use angle and consistency to amplify stimulation instead. This balance between Rocking and Angling gives her a sensation of total coverage across the north wall without you ever losing control of leverage.
The rhythm ratio should stay one-to-one: inhale on the center lift, exhale on each directional glide. The pattern feels like breath painting across her interior—inhale, exhale right, inhale, exhale left. Each breath fills the space between your bodies, smoothing transitions. Over time, your nervous system learns to sync these patterns unconsciously. That’s Flow—the body’s intuitive memory taking over what once required thought.
If fatigue builds, especially through shoulders or lower back, pause mid-cycle and sink briefly into Lift Reset. Inhale, feel your chest rise, then exhale slowly as you drop back in. This neutral moment restores your rhythm and protects your joints. For endomorphic practitioners, these brief resets are mandatory rest hygiene—never skip them. The aim is not endurance through tension but endurance through efficiency.
When you’re fully in Flow, your movements will feel circular rather than linear. Each glide feeds the next; each breath powers the next wave. The metaphor here is a pendulum—it never stops, it simply transfers momentum from side to side, each swing smooth and deliberate. She feels this as continuous stimulation without sharp edges, a rolling rhythm that builds internal heat and dissolves resistance. You’ll sense her body aligning to you, her hips following your path as her breath matches yours. That’s the confirmation that Flow has been established and maintained.
After the session, stay in plank for one final neutral breath, inhaling to center and exhaling through the entire body. Record your observation in a single line: “Zig east-west smooth, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, breath locked, hips synced.” This captures Flow integrity and the presence of synchronization. Once your breath, pressure, and rhythm can hold steady for five full minutes without mental effort, you’re ready to approach controlled depth work. Ready to proceed to Module 6 for Zig Zag with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=======================================================================================


Module 6 teaches controlled expansion into the deeper ten percent of the Zig Zag stroke, where precision replaces force and the rhythm you built in Flow becomes a quiet descent. Begin in the same forearm plank baseline you’ve practiced since Module 1, knees wide enough to release lower back tension and hips aligned directly above her pelvis. For an endomorphic build, the key is gravity control—let your body weight do the work instead of muscle strain. Inhale through the nose to lengthen your spine, then exhale slowly as your hips drop a single inch deeper, staying aware of the resistance as you enter the mid zone. The pressure must remain Medium, not Hard. Your 5–7-inch range gives you access to the deep band without risk of collision; the goal is to feel the north wall glide transform into a slow compression that wraps around your shaft. Think of it as sliding into warm clay—it molds around you rather than yielding completely.
At this point, Rocking becomes your primary motion and Angling becomes your steering. Each Drop Rock pushes north-northeast along her internal ridge; each return shifts southwest, never straight back. The diagonal keeps tension alive across her upper wall, feeding steady friction even as your movement slows. Breath anchors the tempo. Inhale for the slight lift, exhale to press. If her breath catches or her pelvic curl deepens, that’s the sign you’ve found the deep receptive pocket. Stay there and hold the pressure steady. This isn’t about depth for its own sake—it’s about sustaining the fullness that makes her body start to tremble. When done right, she exhales audibly and her thighs firm around your hips, locking you in the correct plane.
Use the SSP loop during this stage. Define what angle you believe creates the strongest suction; hypothesize a small change in Rocking angle—two degrees left or right; test for three breaths; then refine. The north wall is your compass, and the deep band is fragile territory. Too much thrust collapses the suction; too little, and she loses tension. Track her cues. If she suddenly stills or her breath shortens, that’s the cervix warning. Immediately inhale and Lift Reset to the shallow 80% zone, allowing her to recover. This reset is your safety circuit and must happen before fatigue sets in. Endomorphic frames carry momentum, so use your weight to press, not to force. Keep your glutes engaged to stabilize the hips and your lower abs drawn in to control descent speed.
After each five-breath descent series, return fully to baseline. This neutral pause recalibrates your depth and joint load. It also prevents heat buildup in the lumbar spine, which is a common fatigue point for heavier builds. As you return to shallow depth, focus on circulation—breathe deeply and feel the oxygen cool your core. Then descend again, letting breath lead rather than effort. Each cycle should feel smoother than the last, as if your body is sinking into rhythm rather than trying to control it. You’ll know you’re doing it right when you no longer feel like you’re “going deeper”; instead, it feels like the world is closing in around you. That’s depth mastery.
For journaling, keep your note simple and factual: “Deep 10% locked, Medium pressure, 3-breath hold, suction stable.” This record tells you your nervous system is learning to manage the deep zone without tension or panic. The longer you can maintain that state without losing breath rhythm, the closer you are to instinctive mastery of the Zig Zag’s full depth range.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for Zig Zag with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=======================================================================================




Module 7 transitions the Zig Zag stroke from depth control to precision dominance. This phase is called Pinning because your body becomes the anchor point that holds her orgasmic current in place. You are no longer chasing rhythm; you are managing aftershocks. Begin in your familiar forearm-plank baseline. The moment her climax or build reaches a trembling edge, freeze your depth at the 80–90% band, keeping your pelvis heavy and your breath deep. For an endomorphic frame, widen your knees slightly to drop your center of gravity and protect your lower spine. The focus now shifts from movement to micro-adjustment—your keystrokes turn into tools for modulation instead of motion. Think of your hips as a dimmer switch, not a lever.
Start the post-orgasm hold with a slow inhale through your nose, filling the belly until it presses down against her. On the exhale, apply a micro Rock, a pressure ripple that moves less than a fingertip but sends a shockwave through the north and east walls. This pressure wave keeps her nervous system lit without overwhelming her. Watch her cues: her breath will flatten, her hands may tense, then release again. Each of those changes tells you how much voltage remains in her system. If her hips rise to meet you, sustain the seal; if she sinks and exhales, soften back toward the shallow 80% zone to let her reset.
Now move into the SSP loop—Observe, Tweak, Test. Observe her post-orgasm patterns for three breaths. Tweak your compass angle a few degrees northeast or southwest to wake a different nerve path. Test with three micro Rock pulses, light to medium pressure only. You’re tracking how quickly her body reignites. The moment you see her inner thighs tighten or her pelvis roll toward you, you’ve reactivated the circuit. Stay there and breathe with her. Each new wave will require less motion and more stability. That’s your sign of rising sensitivity.
Avoid overuse of deep 10% zones in this stage. Your 5–7-inch range gives enough reach to stimulate her inner walls without striking her cervix. The objective is to pin pleasure inside her, not to drill deeper. If you feel pelvic strain or her breath turns shallow and guarded, Lift Reset to 70% depth and restart. Each reset teaches your nervous system to differentiate control from collapse. Endomorphic builds tend to compress joints faster when locked for too long; between sets, lower onto your knees and sit back for two breaths before resuming. That small recovery window preserves circulation and prevents hip fatigue.
As her body begins to ripple again under your stillness, layer in Angling. The Zig Zag’s diagonal nature lets you redirect intensity without leaving depth. A micro tilt of your pelvis southeast shifts contact from her upper wall to her base ridge; a return tilt northwest reignites the upper ridge again. Alternate this Rocking–Angling exchange every breath or two until her rhythm synchronizes to yours. You’ll feel her pelvic floor flutter like an echo—those are the secondary orgasms waking. Maintain presence through them, steady breath, no speed increase.
Close each session with stillness and exhalation. Withdraw to 80%, hold her hips gently, and feel the calm wave pass through both of you. This is how you seal the training: control through containment. Write a quick log entry right after practice—“Pin@85%, NE tilt 2°, pulse@3, 2 waves reignited.” These shorthand lines track where your precision generated the cleanest responses. Over time you’ll learn which compass combinations create multiple aftershocks fastest and with the least effort.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for Zig Zag with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=======================================================================================


Module 8 is the integration stage—the point where everything you’ve trained in posture, keystroke control, depth zoning, and breath rhythm becomes a living practice. The goal now is not repetition for its own sake but consolidation. You’re wiring these movements into your nervous system so they become instinctive. Begin each training week with a recalibration of your neutral forearm plank: elbows under shoulders, knees wide, hips level, spine long. For an endomorphic body, the weight of your torso is your advantage, not your enemy; use gravity as resistance training for control. Inhale fully through the nose to engage your diaphragm, then exhale as you drop to the shallow 80% depth. This anchors your awareness before you begin any work.
In the first week, spend your time mastering the shallow and mid zones only. Each session should begin with breath synchronization and one or two light Rocking keystrokes—Pushout Shuttle and Lateral Glide are perfect here. The focus is on clarity of wall contact, not speed or arousal. Your penis should feel as if it’s painting the north wall with deliberate pressure, guided by your exhale. Train for five slow cycles of Rocking and then return to baseline. These early sessions recalibrate muscle memory and teach you to feel her responses before moving deeper. The moment you sense a deeper exhale or pelvic curl, pause and memorize that angle. Those are your wall signatures—the exact compass bearings where pleasure begins.
During the second week, begin chaining the keystrokes. Use a 3-breath rhythm: inhale on lift, exhale through descent, then hold at contact for one full beat before rising again. Practice this sequence across the 80–10–10 zones—shallow 80% for warm-up, mid 10% for control, deep 10% for pressure modulation. Limit deep entry to every third or fourth cycle; your goal is endurance and sensory clarity, not maximum penetration. Endomorphic builds should avoid full lumbar arching—keep your core tight and your hips steady to prevent strain. You’ll notice as stamina improves that your breathing slows and her body synchronizes naturally. That’s when Flow emerges without conscious effort.
By the third week, your focus shifts to stability under load. Work through extended Flow sets where you maintain rhythm for longer intervals—ten to fifteen breath cycles—without losing precision. Alternate diagonals of the Zig Zag: north-northeast on descent, south-southwest on withdrawal. This lateral pressure pattern sculpts her inner walls and heightens the suction effect. Watch for cues: hips pulling in, thighs firming, or a stilling silence before an exhale. Each is a signal that your compass alignment is correct. Adjust pressure slightly up or down to keep her on the edge. End every session with a Lift Reset—withdraw to shallow depth, release your breath fully, and stay still for two counts. This neutralizes your system and prevents overstimulation.
The final week is about integration and reflection. You’re now working in full SSP loop awareness—Define, Hypothesize, Track, Refine—each night. Define your objective for the session, maybe endurance or precision. Hypothesize a keystroke adjustment, like a sharper northeast tilt. Track her responses through observable cues. Refine by adjusting your breath, pressure, or angle mid-session. The Zig Zag, when fully integrated, should feel like a gliding diagonal engine inside her—smooth, deliberate, and almost hypnotic. You’re no longer performing a stroke; you’re embodying it. Your body moves as one continuous wave.
Close every session by journaling a single line that captures both action and observation, such as, “Zig Zag, NE@80–90%, Medium pressure, full sync by breath six.” These records are your roadmap for refinement and allow you to trace progress over time. If fatigue or joint tightness appears, rest for a full day; endomorphic frames benefit from recovery windows to keep joints fluid and stamina high. Within four weeks, your body will execute the Zig Zag without thought—each keystroke, angle, and breath merged into instinct.
