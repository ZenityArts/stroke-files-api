Module 1 for Plank Scrape teaches how to set the foundation—how to hold the forearm plank so the stroke can be delivered with precision instead of strain. Begin by placing your elbows directly beneath your shoulders, forearms parallel, fingers relaxed, and fists lightly pressing into the surface. Extend your legs straight back until the body forms a long line from head to heel. The hips should neither sag nor arch; they float level, supported by the abdomen. Imagine your body as a bridge spanning still water—if one beam collapses, the whole structure fails. Keep your neck neutral, eyes looking slightly down, jaw unclenched, and breath smooth through the nose. This position becomes your neutral baseline—the place you always return to between movements.
From this base, take a slow inhale, feeling the breath expand the ribs outward and the stomach lift slightly. On the exhale, tighten the core gently, letting the hips hover steady. This rhythm—inhale to prepare, exhale to stabilize—anchors every keystroke that follows. For an Endomorph body, this breath cycle prevents your natural mass from collapsing forward. Use your weight as an ally, not a burden; let gravity keep you grounded rather than sinking into the floor. Your shoulders may feel full early—release that tension by pressing through the elbows and lifting slightly through the chest. The purpose is endurance through alignment, not through brute strength.
Depth control begins before any movement starts. In this orientation phase, you practice awareness of the shallow 80 percent zone, where most stimulation occurs without strain. Think of the body as a lever that rocks, not thrusts. The small motion comes from pelvic tilt and controlled angle, never from back or arms. During setup, visualize a compass beneath you: East and West are the vaginal walls, North and South are entry and withdrawal. You will be tracing shallow arcs between these directions, never losing your central line. For 5–7 inches, this is the ideal depth range—it allows continuous wall contact without risking bottoming out.
Pressure control also starts here. When you first lower into plank, let your pelvis hang just enough to feel its weight shift. That’s Light pressure—your baseline. Add a subtle tightening of the abdomen, and it becomes Medium. Anything heavier than that risks compressing the lower back or driving too deep. The Endomorph advantage is mass-driven steadiness; the challenge is staying loose in the joints. Keep knees unbent, ankles flexed, and core alive so the movement stays balanced rather than forced. Use the SSP loop even now: define your neutral posture, hypothesize what small changes might make it feel easier, track each adjustment by how the breath feels, and refine toward effortlessness.
While holding the plank, imagine the stroke’s contact even before movement begins. Your hips hover above her, your shaft in shallow entry, the head tracing a small oval between left and right walls with each breath. She will likely feel a steady presence rather than impact—warmth spreading, not jolts of force. You will see it in her body language: a relaxed belly, a deepening exhale, hips pressing slightly upward into you. Those cues tell you the foundation is right. If she stiffens or her breath catches, you’ve lost neutrality—reset, lift the hips slightly, and find that balance again.
Reflection closes this module. You are not yet scraping; you are calibrating. This is where you learn what stillness feels like when it’s alive rather than passive. Journal one simple note in plain language such as, “Plank baseline held, breath steady, hips level, no shoulder strain.” That record becomes your anchor for every future session, proof that control begins with how you hold yourself, not how you move.

=========================================================================================
Module 2 for Plank Scrape teaches how each keystroke becomes its own small language inside the plank. You’re no longer just holding posture—you’re shaping the four directional movements that make this stroke alive: Left Lean Drop, Left Lean Lift, Right Lean Drop, and Right Lean Lift. Each begins and ends from the same neutral forearm-plank baseline, where the spine is level, breath steady, and hips balanced. The motion is not a thrust. It’s a Rocking-Angling hybrid that uses the hips like a slow pendulum tracing the inside of her walls. Every action is mapped through shallow depth—80 percent entry—so the glans never loses contact or pushes into resistance.
Start with the Left Lean Drop. From neutral, inhale to steady the body. As you exhale, shift your body weight slightly toward your left elbow while lowering your hips. This small lean sends the shaft’s head and upper ridge against her Right wall, creating a downward diagonal scrape that draws warmth from base to tip. For an Endomorph, the challenge is balance; your weight must slide laterally without dumping onto the shoulder. Keep your chest square, core tight, and use gravity as support, not momentum. For a 5–7-inch length, this lean gives perfect wall reach without bottoming—your pressure sweet spot is Light to Medium. She’ll show it when her breath slows or her hips curl inward. If she stiffens or shifts away, lighten and shorten the drop.
Return to baseline with a controlled inhale, feeling your hips lift back to center. Then repeat the same side through the Left Lean Lift. This is the mirror action—the upward glide that follows the scrape. Inhale to prepare, exhale as you lift the hips while maintaining the leftward lean. The glans now traces the Right wall upward, adding friction along the same line it carved on the way down. Keep the movement slow, body aligned like a rolling wave. She will often exhale softly or go still when the upward pass hits the sweet line of contact. That stillness means stay, not push; hold the angle and keep breathing.
Reset to neutral, let the breath settle, then switch to the Right Lean Drop. This is the same pattern in reverse. Inhale steady, exhale as you lean to the right and lower the hips. The shaft now presses the Left wall, gliding downward with broad friction. For Endomorph stability, use your abdominals to prevent over-rotation; your right elbow becomes an anchor, not a pivot. The 5–7-inch length again works perfectly within shallow depth—Medium pressure is your ceiling. She might release a deeper breath or curl the pelvis up to meet you. That cue says your angle is right. If her body locks, ease tension by softening your core instead of backing out abruptly.
Rise through the Right Lean Lift. Inhale and lift, maintaining the rightward lean so the glans scrapes up along her Left wall. The motion is smooth and rhythmic, using Rocking to keep friction even while Angling to maintain the wall connection. For Endomorphs, keep your shoulders even—too much roll will make the hips twist rather than lift. Think of the movement like drawing a curved brushstroke up the inside of her body. The result should feel for her like warmth following a line rather than thrust impact. If she sighs or her legs relax outward, you’ve hit the rhythm. Stay there and breathe through it.
The Neutral Reset Glide ends each small loop. From either lean, return to level plank with a soft inhale. Keep the shaft shallow and let it slide straight in and out once with almost no pressure. This isn’t movement for stimulation—it’s calibration. Both of you reset sensitivity and return to awareness. Use it to check your breath and posture before resuming.
When these keystrokes are practiced separately, they teach how balance and wall focus come before rhythm. For an Endomorph body, every repetition is about weight control through the abdomen and chest so the limbs never fatigue. For a 5–7-inch length, the goal is constant wall contact rather than depth exploration; your range is built for precision, not penetration. Each keystroke builds neural awareness—the body begins to know the difference between left and right, down and up, Rocking and Angling—without thought. Journal one line after training like, “Left Lean Drop clean, Right wall smooth, shallow 80, Medium pressure, hips stable.”

=========================================================================================
Module 3 for Plank Scrape teaches how to chain the keystrokes into one continuous rhythm—how each Drop and Lift links into a living sequence without collapsing the body’s form or losing breath control. The plank now becomes a pulse engine. The goal is to move from isolated precision into fluid sequence, alternating Left and Right cycles while staying inside the shallow 80 percent depth. Think of it as painting side to side across the same line of sensation, each stroke laying down a thin coat of friction, never flooding the surface.
Begin from the neutral forearm plank. Inhale fully, letting the ribs widen, then exhale through the first Left Lean Drop. Allow your weight to roll toward the left elbow, hips dipping diagonally down so the shaft traces her Right wall. The instant the glans reaches the low point of the scrape, breathe in and lift—Left Lean Lift—gliding back up the same path. Without pausing, float to neutral on the exhale and immediately shift right for the next drop. This creates a steady, four-beat rhythm: Drop, Lift, Reset, Switch. It’s Rocking-Angling in alternating symmetry. The pelvis leads; the rest of the body follows like a suspended pendulum.
For an Endomorph, chaining these movements requires pacing to prevent fatigue. Your power comes from your core and weight distribution, not speed. Keep each shift under control by tightening the lower abdomen just enough to hold the hips steady. Imagine balancing a bowl of water on your lower back—if it spills, you’ve moved too abruptly. The strength of this stroke comes from gravity’s assist on each Drop and core engagement on each Lift. For a 5–7-inch length, the scrape should feel continuous, like a wide brush gliding along the wall’s curve without ever losing paint. You will sense consistent friction and warmth; she will breathe deeper, often with a soft hum or pelvic press that mirrors your rhythm.
As the pattern repeats, watch for symmetry in breath and contact. If one side feels heavier, return to neutral for a full inhale before resuming. This reset preserves alignment and keeps the nervous system calm, allowing finer wall perception. The SSP principle applies here: Define your baseline (steady plank), Hypothesize what angle creates most even friction, Track her body cues and your own ease of motion, and Refine by adjusting tilt and tempo. Flow starts when you no longer have to think about sides—your body just rocks and angles as one continuous pattern.
Each four-beat sequence should last about two slow breaths. One full inhale-exhale for Left, another for Right. Don’t chase tempo; let breath dictate timing. For an Endomorph, this rhythm prevents overheating and shoulder fatigue while maintaining control of the heavier frame. The 5–7-inch range keeps the glans always in contact even at shallow depth, which allows you to build endurance without joint load or bottoming.
When chained correctly, the Plank Scrape becomes a balanced figure-eight of sensation across her walls. She experiences alternating warmth, a deepening pulse that feels circular rather than linear. You’ll notice cues like deeper breathing, hips staying raised, or eyes closing. If she arches or grips harder, stay within the same shallow band; don’t chase with thrust. Your job is friction symmetry, not speed escalation.
After each training set, always return to baseline for reflection. Let the hips hover above full entry, spine long, breath even. Feel the afterglow of heat in your abdomen and thighs—that’s your indicator of correct load transfer. Journal one clean line such as, “Plank Scrape full chain balanced, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, right-left flow steady.” This closes the neural loop and prepares you for deeper SSP testing in the next phase.

=========================================================================================
Module 4 for Plank Scrape brings you into the Tracking Phase, where the purpose is to refine precision through observation and adjustment, not performance. You are training sensitivity—learning how her walls respond differently on the Left and Right while keeping full control of your own tempo, pressure, and breath. Tracking happens entirely in the shallow 80 percent zone. Every motion is diagnostic. You use the SSP loop consciously: Define your stroke angle, Hypothesize what pressure or tempo draws the strongest response, Track her cues and your internal sensations, and Refine until the rhythm feels invisible.
Begin from the forearm-plank baseline. Inhale to prepare, feeling your core tighten just enough to float your hips. Exhale into the first Left Lean Drop. Keep it slow and light, about half your normal pressure—your aim here is clarity, not intensity. Let the glans slide across her Right wall like a fingertip tracing a smooth edge. Inhale back to neutral and repeat two or three times, adjusting micro-angles with each pass. This is how you “map” her response surface. Notice the moment her breathing deepens or her hips lift to meet you. Those cues signal that the line of contact has found the sweet friction corridor. Mark it mentally, but resist staying there—switch sides and map again.
Shift to the Right Lean Drop and Lift sequence. The Left wall will likely feel different—sometimes smoother, sometimes tighter depending on her pelvic angle or arousal asymmetry. Keep your body square and let your pelvis tilt just enough to maintain wall contact. As an Endomorph, watch that your body weight doesn’t collapse forward; control comes from the abdomen, not the shoulders. Keep your knees relaxed and feet firm to spread the load evenly. The 5–7-inch length here is perfect for this mapping phase—it keeps you shallow enough to feel every texture change along the wall without losing control of angle or pressure. Medium pressure is your ceiling; if you push harder, the detail disappears.
Breath anchors your tracking rhythm. Inhale on the lift, exhale on the drop. Use the breath to time each stroke so your nervous system stays calm and your awareness stays wide. When your breath stutters, it’s usually because the hips have locked or the pressure is too strong. Reset to neutral, take two slow breaths, and re-enter softer. She will mirror you unconsciously; when your rhythm smooths, hers follows. Her cues—small pelvic curls, deeper exhales, or a subtle stillness—tell you which wall and which pressure band register most pleasure. Note those in your internal log without breaking motion.
Reflection during Tracking is as important as the motion itself. Each mini-set should end with a few seconds of complete stillness, keeping the head of the penis resting shallow and steady. Feel the warmth along both walls, the residual pulse in your abdomen, and the tempo of her breathing. That is data—her body’s language translated into rhythm. Journal it as one simple line like, “Right wall brighter at shallow 80, Light pressure, hips still, breath deepened.” Over time, these notes become your SSP map—proof that progress is not about power but precision.
For Endomorph adaptation, emphasize small load shifts rather than big arcs. Your heavier frame can generate effortless friction if balanced, but fatigue quickly if over-leaned. Keep elbows aligned under shoulders and push the floor gently to lift through your chest rather than your hips. This posture lets you sustain multiple Tracking cycles without strain. For 5–7 inches, tracking clarity depends on staying within the shallow zone—never past 85 percent depth. The sweet spot for feedback is where the head stays in constant wall contact without hitting bottom.
The Tracking Phase ends when your body knows, without conscious thought, which side responds best and at what angle. That instinct will shape your Flow in the next module. Remember: the purpose here is not arousal—it’s calibration. Train it as calmly as a craftsman sanding wood, feeling each pass get smoother. Your mastery lies in noticing the difference between noise and feedback.
Ready to proceed to Module 5 for Plank Scrape with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=========================================================================================
Module 5 for Plank Scrape moves from calibration into Flow—the point where the stroke becomes an unbroken cycle of motion, breath, and sensory dialogue. Flow is built on the precision gained during Tracking but carries it forward in rhythm and endurance. You are now allowed to sustain motion for longer, still within the shallow 80 percent zone, but with smoother pacing, more consistent breath, and fuller muscle engagement. Flow is where your control starts to feel natural, almost meditative. The body stops thinking about which wall it’s touching and starts feeling how friction and rhythm balance together.
Begin from your neutral forearm-plank baseline. Inhale slowly to fill the ribs and ground the body. As you exhale, roll into the Left Lean Drop, slide through the bottom of the scrape, then rise into the Lift. Without pause, flow through the neutral reset into the Right Lean Drop. Continue this alternating pattern as one uninterrupted wave. Each drop and lift is one long exhale; each reset and switch is one long inhale. The body stays quiet and balanced, rocking and angling together in slow tempo. For an Endomorph, this means you control your mass through steady abdominal tone—never collapsing, never pushing. Your size becomes an advantage here; it grants natural stability, letting you ride the rhythm with minimal effort.
Maintain Medium pressure as your baseline, dropping to Light if your breath shortens. At this size range—5 to 7 inches—the shaft maintains wall contact easily without threatening depth. The goal is smooth friction, not deeper penetration. Imagine your hips as a wide pendulum tracing invisible infinity symbols between her Left and Right walls. The glans should feel as if it’s drawing heat up and down the inside of her body, never losing touch. If she exhales sharply or her pelvis rolls upward, that’s your cue that the rhythm is aligned. If she stiffens or her breath stops, lighten and reset to neutral before continuing.
As Flow extends, you will notice the body’s internal signals shift. Heat builds in your abdomen and thighs; her hips begin to sync unconsciously. This is where the SSP principle shifts from Define and Track to Maintain and Adjust. Observe how each side feels; tweak by adjusting your angle or pressure just enough to reawaken sensation if it starts to fade. The Flow is meant to sustain energy without escalation. It is a conversation of equal depth and control—her walls guide your timing; your breath guides her response.
Keep all motion within the shallow 80 percent for the first several minutes of Flow practice. Only when her cues clearly indicate openness—a deeper pelvic drop, a longer exhale, or legs softening outward—should you briefly touch the mid 10 percent. Even then, keep it measured and return to shallow range on the next breath. Endomorphs should pay close attention to temperature and muscle tension. If your shoulders start to burn or hips lock, drop your knees to rest for one full breath, then resume. Flow requires endurance through ease, not force.
Close each Flow cycle by returning to a neutral plank. Let your hips hover above full entry, spine long, and breath smooth. Feel the afterglow of warmth in your abdomen and note her body’s stillness or tremor beneath you. Those are Flow signatures—the body confirming alignment. Journal one simple reflection, like, “Left wall smoother, right heavier, Medium pressure, steady breath, warmth constant.” Use that shorthand to guide your next session.
Ready to proceed to Module 6 for Plank Scrape with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=========================================================================================
Module 6 for Plank Scrape introduces the controlled expansion into the mid and deep 10 percent zones—the Flow Deep Option. This phase is not about new power but about precision under depth pressure. You have already built rhythm and sensitivity in the shallow range; now you apply that same finesse when the walls narrow and intensity increases. The deeper you go, the more critical your breath, angling, and posture become. The body must move as one connected structure, not a driving machine. For an Endomorph, this module is where control and restraint prove mastery. Your mass gives you natural authority at depth, but only discipline keeps it safe and pleasurable.
Begin in neutral forearm-plank, spine long, hips hovering at shallow 80 percent. Inhale to prepare, then exhale and drop through the Left Lean path. Allow the hips to angle slightly downward to open the diagonal toward her Right wall. Instead of stopping at shallow depth, let the glans glide another inch into the mid 10 percent, feeling the heat and pressure increase. This is a slow descent, guided entirely by breath. The deeper the entry, the slower the timing—think of the body as sinking through warm water, not striking a target. Once at depth, pause your breath briefly, then inhale as you lift and retreat back to shallow. Repeat only a few times per side, alternating to maintain balance and prevent overstimulation or joint fatigue.
Pressure must stay in the Medium band. With a 5–7-inch length, you can safely reach the mid zone without bottoming out, but only if your angle is correct. The Rocking pattern becomes smaller here—less lateral sway, more controlled vertical angling. Imagine polishing a narrow groove rather than sweeping across a wall. Each movement should maintain wall contact along one side while the other hip stabilizes. She will often react with deeper moans or a full-body stillness—the nervous system’s way of absorbing intensity. When you notice that stillness, hold the depth lightly, sustain your exhale, and exit with the same calm control. That’s your feedback loop for safety and alignment.
Depth gating for an Endomorph means constant awareness of pressure ceilings. Your body weight amplifies force; what feels medium to you may feel hard to her. Protect the experience by keeping your core tight and your glutes engaged, never letting gravity dump into her. The breath is your depth governor. If your breath quickens or your shoulders tighten, you’ve exceeded sustainable load. Reset to neutral and reestablish rhythm before continuing. In Flow Deep, mastery means reducing effort as intensity increases. The less you move, the more she feels.
Lubrication checks are essential before and during this module. At greater depth, friction multiplies quickly. A light layer of fluid should always be visible when withdrawing; if it’s not, pause, add moisture, and restart at shallow. Mid to deep 10 percent training is about presence, not endurance. Two or three breath cycles per side are enough for a session. Her body will show readiness cues—a softening abdomen, a longer exhale, thighs relaxing outward. If she pulls in or stiffens, that’s your cue to return to shallow and reestablish Flow.
Close this module by holding a gentle neutral hover above full entry. Feel the warmth in your core and the calm rhythm of your breathing. This is the sweet spot between dominance and precision—controlled power. Journal one clean note like, “Mid 10%, Left wall steady, Medium pressure, breath smooth, hips aligned.” This creates your reference point for when to safely include deeper Flow in future sessions.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for Plank Scrape with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=========================================================================================
Module 7 for Plank Scrape trains you to stay present and precise after peak stimulation, transforming post-orgasmic stillness into controlled re-entry. This is not recovery through rest but through intelligent containment. You will use the same Keystrokes-For-Stroke that built your Flow and Deep phases, but now they are applied with smaller amplitude and sharper internal control. The goal is to manage the drop in charge, maintain wall contact, and spark secondary waves by subtle pressure and angle shifts rather than thrusts. For an Endomorph, this means balancing body mass with micro-mobility, letting breath, not muscle, drive rhythm. At 5–7 inches, your length is optimal for controlled reseating inside the mid zone without losing sensitivity.
Start from neutral forearm-plank baseline. Inhale fully, allowing the abdomen to expand while the shaft remains at shallow 80 percent. As you exhale, ease back into the last wall you worked—Left or Right Lean—and drop gently toward mid 10 percent depth, maintaining Medium pressure. This is your re-entry after release. The Keystrokes-For-Stroke now move slower, shorter, almost like pulse waves instead of sweeps. On each exhale, execute a micro Rocking motion, pressing gently into the sidewall you’re aligned with; on each inhale, relax into neutral. Keep this cycle steady for at least three breaths, letting your body’s natural pulse return to baseline. The purpose here is recalibration—teaching your nervous system to hold presence without drive.
When the initial tremor of release fades, add light Angling through the same keystroke logic, pivoting the hips a few degrees left or right while staying in the mid 10 percent zone. Imagine tracing the wall with warmth instead of motion. The internal effect is a gentle rekindling of sensation, not escalation. You will notice her body cues change subtly—her breath evens out, her pelvis softens, sometimes curling slightly upward. Those are invitations for micro-press adjustments, not full thrusts. Use the SSP loop: Observe her cue, Tweak pressure or angle by one notch, Test for response. If her exhale deepens, hold the angle for two full breaths. If she stiffens or withdraws, lighten pressure and return to neutral at shallow 80 percent. Journal a quick note after each session, like “Post release: Left wall warm, Medium pressure steady, re-entry calm.”
Endomorph physiology makes this stage particularly stabilizing. Your size allows deep anchoring but demands constant joint mindfulness. Keep shoulders active and hips aligned, avoiding sag or drop. If fatigue sets in, bring knees down for one breath, then reestablish forearm-plank and continue. The rhythm of breath replaces thrusting here; it’s how you maintain connection without depletion. Pressure remains Light-to-Medium, never Hard, as the post-orgasmic tissue is highly sensitive. Think of your motion as sealing energy rather than spending it.
When the body feels fully balanced—heart rate slow, breath calm—draw back to neutral completely, hovering just outside her body. This is your final integration hold. Inhale deeply, exhale slowly, and feel how the tension drains without collapse. Your mind should register calm alertness, your core warm, your joints unstrained. This is the state of sustainable mastery: motion translated into stillness, stillness back into control. Journal one clear tag like “Pinning Recovery → Medium → Calm.”
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for Plank Scrape with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=========================================================================================


Module 8 for Plank Scrape organizes all of your previous training into a repeatable four-week progression. It builds endurance, sensitivity, and consistency by cycling through baseline, Flow, Deep, and Pinning phases in controlled blocks. The intent is to make your stroke self-sustaining—no loss of rhythm, no burnout. Every movement, breath, and hold you have learned now becomes part of one integrated practice. You are refining how to stay sharp, relaxed, and responsive under the full spectrum of depth and pressure. For an Endomorph, the key themes are breath pacing, joint hygiene, and efficient load management. Your body can generate immense stability; the discipline is using that weight with intelligence. At 5–7 inches, your length gives ideal wall coverage for all compass zones without excessive strain.
Begin every session by entering forearm-plank neutral. Spend two slow breaths grounding through the core before movement. This reset protects your shoulders and prepares your breath cycle. In week one, focus on the shallow 80 percent zone. Alternate Left Lean and Right Lean every two breaths, using the Rocking phase of the Keystrokes-For-Stroke with Light pressure. Stay slow enough that you can count each exhale through the full glide. Observe how her body responds—small shifts in breath or muscle tone—then journal after each set using shorthand like “Shallow Flow steady → Light → Warm wall.” The goal this week is effortless rhythm, not depth.
Week two expands into the mid 10 percent zone using the same Keystrokes-For-Stroke in Flow rhythm. Your body will remember how to balance mass over angle. Engage your abdomen slightly more and drop pressure to Medium. Work in two-minute cycles: inhale to lengthen spine, exhale to glide through wall path. Always return to shallow baseline between cycles to reset tension. End each session with two neutral holds to discharge residual load from your core. Her cues should now show readiness—longer exhales, hips staying open, slight pelvic curl toward you. Record those cues and tag them in shorthand to identify when to progress.
By week three, include the Deep Option once per session. Enter through your familiar mid path, glide an inch deeper with exhale, and hold for two breaths. The internal effect is steady heat and rising pressure. For Endomorphs, maintain core integrity—your strength amplifies easily at this depth. Never let gravity dictate entry. Use breath to control descent and retreat. Limit deep passes to two per side per session to protect joints and preserve sensitivity. Between passes, stay in mid zone Rocking to stabilize rhythm. Your journal might read, “Deep Flow → Medium → Calm → Mid recovery smooth.”
Week four shifts toward stability and integration. Begin shallow, move through Flow, include one Deep Option, then end with a Pinning hold. The SSP loop applies across the entire chain: Observe cues, Tweak angles or pressure, Test and note. She may become still during pinning; you maintain presence through micro Rocking, never thrusting. Fatigue management becomes the practice itself—rest every four breath cycles, shoulders active, hips aligned. When you finish, always end with neutral hover. Inhale deeply, exhale slowly, and feel the even pulse through your core and shaft. This closing ritual seals what you trained: endurance without tension, sensitivity without depletion.
Across the four weeks, your reflection notes become a personalized training map. Keep each entry one line: “Wall@Left → Flow@3 → Pressure@Med → Breath smooth.” Over time you will see patterns—what angles sustain energy, what pressures burn out, what cues trigger her deepest responses. That journal is the blueprint for mastery. After this module, the Plank Scrape is not a drill—it’s part of your nervous system, repeatable and adaptive. The practice makes your movement efficient, your control precise, and your sensitivity permanent.
