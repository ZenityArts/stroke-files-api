This module teaches how to build the foundation of the Egyptian Small Circles stroke by mastering your body setup and alignment. Every motion you make from this point forward will depend on how well you hold your forearm plank. Your posture is what gives the stroke its accuracy, control, and staying power.
Begin by entering the forearm-plank position on the canvas or bed, knees slightly apart and toes grounded for balance. Keep your elbows directly beneath your shoulders so the load moves through bone alignment rather than muscle strain. Engage your core gently—not by sucking in but by feeling your navel draw toward your spine. The hips should hover level, not sagging or arched. This neutral line is your anchor; from it, every keystroke will emerge cleanly. Inhale through your nose, feel your abdomen expand, and exhale through your mouth as you lightly contract your glutes. Each breath should stabilize you, not tighten you. This breath anchoring keeps motion smooth and responsive when you begin the circular stroke pattern.
From this baseline, check your leverage. A Mesomorph body type has balanced proportions and natural strength, which means power comes easily—but overuse of that strength can destroy finesse. Let your weight rest evenly between your forearms and knees. Keep your chest open and shoulders down to prevent tension from creeping into your neck. The spine remains long, head aligned, gaze downward. This protects your joints and allows hip mobility. Imagine your pelvis as a suspended bowl of water—if you tilt it too far forward or back, the water spills. Keeping the bowl level ensures every rotation stays centered during the Egyptian Small Circles stroke.
Depth control is next. With a Below 5-inch range, your strength lies in clarity of contact rather than penetration. You’ll be working mostly within the shallow 80% of her canal, occasionally brushing the mid 10% during Flow once you’ve trained precision. This means your baseline must prioritize angle awareness over thrust force. From neutral, a micro-tilt of the hips downward aligns the penis along the south wall at Light pressure. On inhale, return to center; on exhale, let the pelvis roll slightly so the head of the penis glides forward. This Angling movement replaces the idea of “pushing in.” She will feel warmth and steady pressure instead of impact.
Joint load management keeps you safe for long sessions. Because your frame has even muscle mass, your risk lies in holding tension rather than collapsing. To prevent fatigue, distribute effort across the kinetic chain—core, hips, and thighs work together. Every few minutes, perform a Hover Reset by pushing gently back toward your heels while maintaining forearm contact. This relieves wrists, spine, and shoulders. When returning to plank, reestablish your breathing rhythm before continuing. She’ll notice when you move fluidly; her breathing will mirror yours, deepening in sync as your motion steadies.
Wall clarity is your measure of alignment success. When your stroke angle is true, you’ll feel smooth gliding along a single surface rather than friction from multiple points. During setup drills, test this by holding Light contact and performing one slow Rocking motion toward the east wall and back. If it feels like one continuous slide instead of two jerks, you’re aligned. When she responds with a soft exhale or a small pelvic curl, it confirms you’re tracing the correct path. Stay in that zone.
Posture prevents injury because it stabilizes the spine under torque. As the stroke develops, your hips will rotate in small arcs, and that rotation can strain the lower back if alignment is lost. The neutral plank—shoulders stacked, hips level, chest open—keeps your axis of rotation centered at the pelvis, where it belongs. This also improves wall clarity, as each keystroke lands cleanly without wobble. If you ever feel your weight collapsing into your arms, pause, hover, reset, and resume only when the line of your body feels balanced again.
Breath anchors are the invisible timing system of this stroke. Use a simple two-beat rhythm: inhale to prepare and align, exhale to move or engage pressure. Each exhale should send energy through your hips, not your arms. Over time, this rhythm becomes instinctive, syncing with her breathing until the motion feels co-created rather than mechanical.
As you train this foundation, journal one clear line after practice: “Neutral plank held steady, shallow 80% angle south, breath matched through 5 cycles.” This single sentence helps you measure control without overthinking. Each session, your alignment should feel more natural and your breath more synchronized.

======================================================================================
This module isolates and refines the keystrokes that build the Egyptian Small Circles stroke. Each movement you’ll train here becomes a letter in the language of this stroke—simple, distinct, and repeatable. Together, they form the small rotational motion that defines Egyptian control: continuous, circular, and centered.
Start from your neutral forearm-plank baseline, knees grounded for balance, spine long, and hips level. The first keystroke is the Pelvic Trace. This is an Angling movement that glides along the south wall in the shallow 80% zone. On inhale, slightly retract your hips, keeping the tip just inside. On exhale, press forward with Light pressure, tracing the wall as if drawing a thin crescent. The motion is not about depth but precision—each pass should feel like running the edge of your thumb along satin, not punching into space. For a Mesomorph, the danger is over-driving this motion. Keep your core relaxed and rely on pelvic articulation, not muscle thrust. She’ll respond with soft breath release or pelvic following when the trace is smooth.
The second keystroke is the Circular Float. This Rocking movement creates the small orbit pattern at the heart of Egyptian Small Circles. From the end of the Pelvic Trace, use a micro roll of your hips to slide pressure from the south wall to the west wall, then up and back to center. Think of your pelvis as the base of a compass rotating gently under her—one hand width of motion at most. Stay in the shallow 80% depth, Medium pressure, keeping breath even. The smaller the circle, the more defined the pleasure pulse becomes. She’ll usually exhale or still her hips when the circle closes perfectly.
Next comes the Anchor Return. This keystroke resets the stroke without breaking rhythm. From any point in the circular motion, draw back just half an inch to reestablish wall clarity. Use inhale to pull back lightly and exhale to settle the head back into shallow contact. This is a Rocking keystroke that keeps the rhythm unbroken and allows you to check angle and lubrication. If you feel friction or dryness, hold the anchor position, breathe, and wait for her body to re-lubricate before continuing. For your size range, this keystroke prevents overreaching and keeps stimulation in the responsive shallow zone.
Finally, train the Compass Lift, a stabilizing keystroke that maintains rotation without losing contact. From center, lift your hips slightly while angling right or left, keeping constant Light pressure along the chosen wall. It’s an Angling move at shallow depth, primarily useful for regaining traction after minor slips. Always return to neutral plank after completing one or two Compass Lifts to prevent fatigue. A Mesomorph’s balanced core makes this easy, but joint load will rise if you lean on your shoulders—keep weight centered over hips.
Throughout this module, cycle these four keystrokes slowly, one after another. After each full rotation—Pelvic Trace, Circular Float, Anchor Return, Compass Lift—pause in neutral baseline, inhale deeply, and feel your body settle. The order is not a performance yet; it’s rehearsal. You’re teaching your nervous system the boundaries of each movement. She’ll notice this clarity later as steadiness, which is the core of Egyptian control.
When you finish your set, note in your journal: “All keystrokes smooth, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, circle consistent across 5 breaths.” The goal is not speed but definition—each keystroke should feel clean, distinct, and effortless.

======================================================================================


This module constructs the Egyptian Small Circles stroke by chaining the isolated keystrokes—Pelvic Trace, Circular Float, Anchor Return, and Compass Lift—into a seamless rhythm that feels like a soft rotation rather than a sequence of moves. The goal is to merge these building blocks into one coherent cycle where every breath, depth change, and wall contact feeds the next. The Egyptian stroke should feel like tracing a coin-sized orbit inside her, steady and deliberate, not thrusting or searching.
Begin in the neutral forearm-plank baseline. Inhale to prepare. On exhale, slide into a shallow entry and execute the Pelvic Trace forward along the south wall. The moment your hips reach the natural end of that trace, transition immediately into the Circular Float by rolling the pelvis laterally, shifting contact toward the west wall. This marks the start of the circular loop. The motion is both Rocking and Angling—the base rocks forward and back while the shaft angles subtly from side to side. Maintain shallow 80% depth, Medium pressure, and smooth breath flow. The key is never breaking wall contact; the head should glide as if drawing an unbroken ring on the inside.
At the top of each orbit, use the Anchor Return to reset orientation without losing rhythm. Inhale slightly, retreat a half inch, then exhale to sink back into contact. This small recovery moment keeps stamina and lubrication intact. It’s also your checkpoint for wall clarity—if the glide feels less fluid, hold the anchor for a breath and let the body realign. She’ll respond with a deeper breath or pelvic release when the clarity is restored. For a Mesomorph, the power is already available; restraint is what perfects the rhythm. Stay low and let the pelvis lead, not the spine.
Once you can sustain the orbit for five continuous breaths, add the Compass Lift. This keeps the circle alive when you shift weight or reposition. Lift your hips slightly, maintaining Light pressure, then drop back into the next rotation. The lift refreshes her stimulation pattern, preventing sensory numbness and maintaining traction. Think of it as catching a new current in the same tide. For your body type, the challenge is endurance—rotate from the hips while keeping forearms light and shoulders relaxed.
By the end of this module, the keystrokes should no longer feel separate. The circle should move like a pendulum’s face—smooth, symmetrical, unhurried. Each cycle should last about two to three seconds, with breath matching the tempo: inhale as you return through Anchor, exhale through the forward trace and float. If her hips begin to mirror your motion or her breath matches yours, that’s confirmation the loop is transmitting clearly.
When journaling, describe it in one clean line, for example: “Circular Float steady, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, hips following by third cycle.” This tells you that your rhythm is synchronized and effective.

======================================================================================


This module takes the Egyptian Small Circles stroke into the Tracking Phase. Here, you begin using the SSP loop in the shallow 80% zone to refine precision, wall awareness, and rhythm stability. Tracking is not about intensity—it’s about learning how small shifts in angle, pressure, or breath affect her response. You will define your hypothesis, test short mini-sets, observe her cues, and refine until your stroke feels effortless and predictable.
Begin from the neutral forearm-plank baseline, inhale to center, and enter the circle at Light pressure. Keep the stroke diameter tight—coin-sized—and complete three full orbits before evaluating. This is your first SSP test. Hypothesis: a slower rotation will deepen her engagement. Run three cycles at slow tempo, matching each rotation to one full breath—inhale during the Anchor Return, exhale during the forward and lateral phases. Watch for her response: if her breath slows or her hips subtly draw you in, your hypothesis is confirmed. If her body goes still or her breathing quickens without pelvic follow-through, the rhythm may be too slow. Adjust in the next mini-set.
Your second test is angle-based. From neutral, shift slightly toward the east wall and repeat five small circles there. Stay within shallow 80% depth, Medium pressure. The sensation changes from broad warmth to a more pointed pulse. For a Mesomorph body, this angle uses hip articulation rather than back movement—keep your spine steady and move from the pelvis only. With your Below 5-inch range, these shallow angles give her the most consistent wall contact, maximizing sensitivity. Observe if she exhales or releases tension; that means the wall is hitting right. If her hips pull away or tighten, reduce pressure slightly and try a softer orbit.
Between each mini-set, perform a Neutral Reset. Inhale, draw hips back just enough to break contact, hover for one breath, then re-enter. This maintains lubrication and lets both bodies reset sensitivity. It also keeps joint load balanced; a Mesomorph can sustain plank easily, but repetitive tension will accumulate if resets are skipped. Treat these pauses as calibration rather than breaks.
Your third SSP test is tempo. Run one mini-set of quicker rotations—one full circle per half breath. The motion should stay smooth, no jerks or thrusts. Track her cues: if she exhales sharply and hips follow, the tempo amplifies arousal. If she tenses or her breathing stops, it’s too abrupt. Use the observation to refine your rhythm back toward steady, hypnotic movement. Remember, this phase is about data, not dominance. You’re studying her nervous system through touch.
After each set, journal one line describing your findings. Example: “East wall, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, slow cycle synced with her breath by third orbit.” This shorthand keeps your learning cumulative. Over time, you’ll recognize which walls, speeds, and pressures her body prefers without needing conscious analysis.
By the end of this module, your stroke should feel precise and low-effort—like tracing a groove that guides you automatically. The SSP tracking teaches you to trust tactile feedback more than visual cues. Her breath, stillness, and pelvic micro-movements become your data stream. When all align, the circle no longer feels mechanical—it becomes a live current between you.

======================================================================================


This module enters the Flow Phase for the Egyptian Small Circles. Everything you built in the earlier modules—your baseline posture, keystroke control, and SSP awareness—now merges into a self-sustaining rhythm. Flow is where the stroke becomes alive. You are no longer testing or adjusting in micro-sets; you are maintaining a continuous loop where breath, motion, and wall contact move as one seamless current. The purpose here is to hold that circular orbit for extended durations without overthinking, while tracking her responses through feel rather than analysis.
Begin in the forearm-plank baseline, weight balanced between elbows and knees, hips relaxed but stable. Inhale deeply through the nose, exhale through the mouth, and start the first circular rotation at the shallow 80% depth zone. Maintain Medium pressure and consistent Light Angling through the orbit, never breaking contact with the wall. Each circle should last about two to three seconds, guided by breath—inhale as you round through the back half, exhale as you glide forward and across. The feeling in your pelvis should be smooth, circular, and light, not forced. Think of your hips as tracing a halo in slow motion, always closing the loop.
As Flow builds, her nervous system begins to sync to yours. You’ll notice her breathing matching your exhale, her hips moving subtly with each rotation, or a stillness that means she’s suspended in the rhythm. These are confirmation cues that the circle has stabilized. For your body type, endurance comes easily but control must stay soft—avoid pressing too hard or overusing core tension. Let your hips do the work, not your arms or shoulders. The neutral reset is always available if you lose traction; one small pullback and re-entry reestablishes precision without breaking tempo.
The Flow Phase should live primarily in the shallow 80%, with occasional forays into the mid 10% if lubrication and her cues allow. For a Below 5-inch range, mid depth will feel like entering a thicker current—more drag, more warmth, slightly slower resistance. Move into it gradually by increasing forward lean half an inch during exhale, then return to shallow orbit on inhale. Keep pressure Medium, never Hard. When she exhales longer or arches subtly upward, that’s a signal that the deeper edge is welcome. If her breath shortens or her hips retreat, stay in shallow flow. This depth management keeps stimulation responsive without strain.
Your breath rhythm anchors the tempo. Use a soft count if needed: inhale-one, exhale-two. Each breath cycle equals one full circle. Over a three-minute Flow set, this creates a hypnotic cadence her body can entrain to. If your stamina begins to fade, shift your weight subtly toward your knees, lighten shoulder load, and continue at slower tempo until balance returns. A Mesomorph’s power can carry too much inertia—resist the urge to accelerate or tighten. The secret of Flow is continuity, not intensity.
End each Flow session with a gentle taper: reduce circle size, lighten pressure to barely-there contact, and let your hips come to stillness while maintaining shallow insertion. Inhale, hold, and exhale completely before withdrawing. This deliberate ending seals the circuit, allowing her body to finish in relaxation rather than emptiness.
In your journal, describe this in one line, for example: “Flow held 3 minutes, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, synchronized breath, hips followed every circle.” The line should record stability, not climax.

======================================================================================


This module explores the controlled deep option within the Egyptian Small Circles stroke. The aim here is not to go “hard” or “deep” in the traditional sense, but to expand your sensory precision into the mid and deep 10% zones without disrupting rhythm or safety. This is a refined practice of depth gating, breath-timed entry, and compass awareness, used only when her body invites it through unmistakable cues. For a Below 5-inch range, this stage becomes less about length and more about angle, pelvic compression, and full-body alignment—using geometry, not force, to reach resonance.
Start in the forearm-plank neutral baseline, breath steady, shallow 80% orbit already established. As you exhale, engage a subtle forward lean from the pelvis, not the spine, guiding the head of your shaft deeper along the south-west or south-east diagonal. The motion remains circular, but the orbit flattens slightly, pressing the head along the bottom wall while maintaining continuous contact. The action is primarily Rocking with a hint of Angling, executed with Medium pressure. Do not thrust or drop weight forward. For a Mesomorph, the power in your hips can easily exceed her tolerance—channel that power into control. Keep shoulders stable and pelvis fluid.
Depth expansion happens gradually over multiple cycles, not a single push. Each rotation can dip one to two millimeters deeper until the head begins to meet natural resistance or a firm warmth—this is the cervix zone. Pause the forward component there, inhale through your nose, and on the exhale, circle slightly upward and outward, tracing a half-orbit that massages the south wall instead of pressing into it. This maintains stimulation while giving her nervous system time to adapt. If she releases a low breath, moans softly, or her hips curl forward, you’re cleared to sustain that depth for a few more cycles. If her breath halts, her body stiffens, or she moves away, reduce pressure immediately and return to the shallow 80%.
Pressure in this module should never exceed Medium. Even a slight Hard push in the deep 10% can trigger defensive tightening rather than pleasure. For your range, full insertion is neither the goal nor the metric; the true skill lies in creating the illusion of fullness by maximizing wall compression. Keep your orbit compact and deliberate, using the lower half of your pelvic arc. The feeling should be like turning a slow wheel beneath the surface, always anchored and circular.
Throughout this work, maintain lubrication awareness. Deep rotation increases friction and heat, so a drop in glide means you must withdraw to re-lubricate naturally. For Mesomorph endurance, schedule a deliberate Neutral Reset every ten rotations. Pull back to shallow depth, rest one breath, then re-enter slowly. This keeps your joints decompressed and your rhythm sustainable.
The purpose of this deep option is to activate the cervix-adjacent zones without shock. When done correctly, she’ll respond with involuntary pelvic micro-movements or sustained stillness—the body’s way of surrendering. Treat this as sacred territory. Never chase depth; invite it.
When journaling, describe what you discovered, not what you achieved. Example: “South-west orbit, mid-depth entry, Medium pressure, hips drew in on fourth cycle.” This shows you tracked invitation, not intrusion.

======================================================================================


This module teaches the Pinning Post-Orgasm Strategy for Egyptian Small Circles—the art of sustaining her arousal waves after climax through controlled micro-variation. Here you use the SSP loop in its Observe → Tweak → Test form to generate additional releases without overstimulation or loss of rhythm. The purpose is to read her body’s changing language immediately after the peak and to keep her in a rolling cycle of pleasure while your own control remains steady and calm.
Begin in the post-orgasm baseline: stay inserted shallow at 80%, your body weight grounded through forearms and knees, hips relaxed. Her body may go still, breath uneven. Observe first. Let her system settle for two or three full breaths. Watch for her first exhale that deepens instead of releasing; that’s your cue to reinitiate movement. Start with Light pressure and smaller circles—half your normal orbit. The action should be mostly Angling, with just enough Rocking to keep the contact warm. Each orbit follows your breath: inhale to prepare, exhale through the rotation. The goal is to bring sensation back gently, not to restart performance.
Once she begins to breathe deeper or her hips lift slightly to meet you, introduce your first tweak: change the orbit direction. If you were circling clockwise, reverse to counterclockwise. The change in wall contact restimulates her nerves in a fresh pattern. Observe. If her breath pauses, wait one cycle, then test again. This is SSP in motion—each micro-change is a hypothesis. You test by watching how her body responds, not by chasing a reaction. When you find the angle or tempo that makes her soften again, sustain it.
After several cycles, apply the second tweak: shift pressure slightly toward Medium, guiding the orbit closer to the side wall that triggered the strongest earlier response, usually east or west. For a Mesomorph body with Below 5-inch range, this change will not come from thrusting deeper but from tightening your circular path to compress that wall more directly. The sensation should feel denser to her, almost like a pulse inside the orbit. If she exhales or moans, stay there for five to ten rotations. When her hips tremble or she arches subtly, she’s entering a secondary wave.
If she instead goes quiet or starts pulling away, reset immediately—inhale, draw hips back a few centimeters, exhale, and hold still. Wait for her next cue before testing again. The rhythm between motion and stillness is the secret of pinning: stimulation, pause, observe, resume. Each stillness allows her nervous system to reset sensitivity and build charge again. Your role is to keep presence and structure while she fluctuates.
Keep lubrication and angle consistent through this whole process. Avoid changing both at once. With your body type, you can hold plank longer than most, but joint fatigue creeps in subtly. After every two to three minutes, ease into a Neutral Reset—hips back, shoulders relaxed, one long exhale—then re-engage at shallow depth. The stability of your structure allows her freedom of release.
Your breath must lead her body, never chase it. The exhale carries your calm; it tells her system she’s safe to open again. Every time you feel her contract around you, think “observe.” Every time she exhales or melts, think “test again.” Over several cycles, this creates a post-orgasmic rhythm where pleasure and rest intertwine seamlessly.
In your journal, record one observation line: “Post-climax, reversed orbit, shallow east wall, Light pressure, hips followed again after sixth cycle.” These lines are the real record of mastery—data collected through empathy, not ego.

This final module integrates everything you’ve learned about the Egyptian Small Circles into a four-week training flow that builds consistency, precision, and endurance. The purpose is to convert isolated keystrokes into reflex-level mastery while protecting your joints, maintaining stamina, and conditioning your nervous system to remain relaxed under arousal. For a Mesomorph body, power will always be available; this plan teaches you to make that power serve precision. For a Below 5-inch range, success depends on wall intimacy, not depth, so every session focuses on accuracy of orbit, breath matching, and partner feedback.
In week one, practice the shallow 80% orbit exclusively. Begin each session in a neutral forearm-plank, spine long, shoulders relaxed, hips aligned over knees. Perform sets of thirty-second rotations followed by fifteen-second resets. Alternate clockwise and counterclockwise orbits. Your priority is structural endurance—train your hips to move fluidly while keeping your upper body quiet. At the end of each practice, note one simple observation in your journal such as, “Shallow south wall, Light pressure, breath sync held for eight cycles.” Do not chase climax; focus on control.
By week two, incorporate the full keystroke sequence you trained earlier. Begin with two minutes of shallow rotations, then add the Rocking and Angling alternations that define the stroke’s signature shape. Gradually expand each orbit into a wider circle while maintaining the shallow depth. This week builds rhythm integrity and awareness of her cues. If her breath matches yours or she melts into the motion, you’re aligned. If her hips shift away or tension rises, lighten pressure or reduce orbit size. Between sets, rest for one minute in neutral plank, breathing fully through your belly to reset joints and maintain clarity.
In week three, introduce the mid-depth 10% option, always guided by her cues and lubrication. Use breath-timed entries, exhaling through each forward curve. The target is to master the sensation of contact—not penetration depth, but consistency. For a Mesomorph, resist your instinct to press; instead, refine sensitivity. Keep pressure Medium and tempo steady. Three-minute continuous flow sets are ideal here. End each with one Neutral Reset and reflection. Journal entries might read: “Mid-depth, Medium pressure, east orbit sustained, hips curled on cue.”
Week four is for full integration—moving through Tracking, Flow, and Pinning in one continuous session. Begin shallow, establish the circular rhythm, observe her cues, then modulate tempo and direction without breaking structure. This teaches your nervous system to remain calm through escalation and decline, the essence of mastery. Alternate shallow Flow with short Pinning bursts. Each set should last around five minutes, followed by full rest. If fatigue builds in the lower back or wrists, spread elbows wider and reduce pelvic amplitude; this preserves form without loss of sensation.
Rest hygiene remains critical throughout. As a Mesomorph, you can overtrain easily. Limit practice to four sessions per week with at least one rest day between each. End every session with ten slow belly breaths while in neutral plank. This clears tension from the pelvic floor and stabilizes your nervous system. Over time, you’ll notice how the movement becomes intuitive—no longer something you “perform,” but something your body remembers.
By the end of this phase, your stroke will no longer depend on conscious control. The Egyptian Small Circles will feel like a current flowing through you, each orbit guided by breath and her subtle responses. The partnership between your structure and her sensitivity becomes the art itself. Record your progress simply but precisely: “Full cycle—Tracking, Flow, Pinning—held rhythm under breath for four minutes, smooth response.”
