This module teaches how to set up your body for the Egyptian Hip Slide so your frame can support long, stable movement without pain or loss of control. Begin in a neutral forearm plank with your elbows directly under your shoulders and your forearms pressing evenly into the surface. Keep your spine straight from crown to tailbone, your hips level, and your knees softly grounded to remove tension from your lower back. Breathe in through your nose to lengthen your spine, then exhale through your mouth to settle your weight evenly across your core. For the endomorphic build, this posture protects the shoulders and wrists from overload by using the abdomen and thighs to carry most of the force. For a penis length between five and seven inches, this setup naturally aligns your entry angle so the underside of the shaft rests along her south wall without bottoming out.
Your goal in this orientation phase is to feel balanced and responsive before you move. The hips should float, not sag. Imagine a string pulling the back of your head and tailbone in opposite directions. This keeps your midline active while allowing the pelvis to swivel freely later when you begin Angling and Rocking. Stay in this position for three steady breaths. On each inhale, feel your ribs widen. On each exhale, press your forearms and toes slightly into the canvas, spreading your body’s weight evenly. This establishes a repeatable neutral baseline—the position you will always return to between keystrokes, phases, and testing cycles.
Depth control begins here. At this angle, use your breath to test how far your hips can glide forward without the pelvis collapsing. The shallow 80% zone will become your default, where the head of your penis presses but does not jam against the deep wall. For the endomorphic body, patience in this zone trains endurance and saves your joints. Keep pressure in the Light to Medium range as you breathe through these small forward glides, allowing your abdomen to control distance rather than your thighs. Each exhale sends gentle weight forward; each inhale draws the hips back an inch to reset. When you feel consistent warmth and even contact along the lower canal, you’ve found the correct working depth.
The Egyptian Hip Slide depends on stability before rhythm. Think of your body as a compass anchored at the center, the hips tracing measured diagonals east and west while the spine stays quiet. To feel this alignment, shift your hips a fingertip to the left and then back to center while keeping your chest still. Repeat to the right. These micro-leans wake up the muscles that later generate precise wall contact. For the endomorphic trainee, these small calibrations teach control through core engagement instead of brute strength. The 5–7 inch range ensures every angle remains inside a safe envelope of motion, allowing consistent contact without strain or loss of position.
Breath anchors keep posture and timing stable. Inhale to prepare before each shift, exhale to guide the motion. If your breath becomes shallow or forced, pause and return to the neutral baseline. Her cues in practice may include a deepening breath, a pelvic curl, or hips pressing back toward you. Each cue signals that alignment and depth are correct. If she pulls away or stiffens, it means your pressure or angle needs softening. Always adjust through breath, not speed—exhale to ease back, inhale to find new space.
Orientation training is the time to test your endurance limits without losing form. For the endomorphic frame, fatigue often builds in the shoulders first; spread weight evenly across the forearms and widen your base by moving the knees slightly apart. Keep the elbows tight to the ribs and the core drawn in. This will reduce joint stress and extend session length. When posture feels effortless for three consecutive breath cycles, your baseline is ready.
A sample journal line after this session might read: “Neutral plank steady, shallow glide holds warmth at midline, shoulders relaxed after fourth exhale.” This note captures alignment, depth, and feedback—enough to measure progress.

================================================================================================
Module two teaches you the keystrokes that form the skeleton of the Egyptian Hip Slide. Every motion you practice from this point forward will build on these shapes. Begin again in your neutral forearm-plank baseline. Elbows under shoulders, hips level, spine long. This baseline will always be your home position—the place your body returns to for recalibration between every motion. From here, you will feel the difference between Rocking, which moves the hips vertically, and Angling, which shifts weight side to side. Both create different types of wall contact. For an endomorphic body, the main goal is balance and economy of movement, keeping your power controlled through the abdomen instead of the arms or lower back. For a penis size of five to seven inches, these keystrokes will help maintain constant, comfortable wall contact without bottoming out.
The first keystroke begins with a gentle lean of the hips to the left. This is an Angling movement that slides your shaft along her right wall. You are not twisting your torso—just lowering the left hip an inch while keeping your chest square. Inhale to prepare, exhale as you shift. Keep pressure Light to Medium. This presses the right edge of your shaft against the inner right wall at the shallow 80% zone. In the body, it feels like a slow pour of weight from one side to the other. For endomorphic builds, stability comes from tightening the core and glutes so the upper body remains still. With a five-to-seven-inch length, the right wall will feel fully engaged, not poked. Her breath will deepen or her hips may soften when the angle is right. If you feel her tense or pull back, ease pressure and re-center with an inhale before trying again.
From this left-lean position, lift the hips upward a finger’s width while maintaining the lean. This creates Rocking and moves the head of the penis upward along the right wall. Exhale through the lift, inhale to return. Keep pressure Light and rhythm slow, as this vertical motion lightly extracts and resets sensitivity. This is a Flow-phase keystroke that builds continuity between moves. For the endomorphic body, use the abdomen to lift instead of pushing from the shoulders. For a mid-length penis, the lift enhances stretch without risk of losing contact. Her cue may be a breath pause or hips rising to meet the motion. Stay there for one breath before returning to the neutral baseline to let the body settle.
Next comes the downward drop, still angled left. This deepens contact with the right wall and creates a controlled re-entry along the south-east diagonal. Pressure increases briefly to Medium or Hard depending on her engagement. Exhale through the descent, inhale to recover. For endomorphic trainees, the glutes and thighs should drive this movement evenly to prevent overloading the wrists. The goal is weight sinking straight down, not pushing forward. At five to seven inches, this movement touches the mid 10% depth zone safely, creating a firm but not jarring pressure. Her breath or small pelvic roll confirms connection. If she stiffens, lighten your drop on the next cycle.
Return to center before beginning the right-side sequence. The right lean mirrors the earlier left lean, sending the shaft’s left edge into her left wall while maintaining underbelly pressure on the south wall. Inhale to lengthen your spine, exhale to lean right. The pressure begins Light and builds toward Medium as the body adjusts. For endomorphic frames, watch that your right elbow doesn’t collapse inward. Use your abdominal control to guide the lean instead of shifting shoulder weight. For the mid-length penis, this angle fills the left wall comfortably without over-rotation. Her cues—steady breath, pelvic curl, hips pressing back—signal balance.
Hold the right lean as you lift vertically. This second Rocking keystroke extracts upward along the left wall. Inhale to prepare, exhale to lift. Keep it Light and shallow within the 80% zone. This motion creates friction while maintaining softness. The endomorphic body must rely on the abs to drive upward rather than lifting through the shoulders. The shorter amplitude ensures contact remains consistent without strain. Her breath may deepen, her body may settle into stillness as the wall adapts to the rhythm.
The downward drop completes the cycle. Lower the hips while still leaning right, exhaling as the weight returns. This presses the shaft downward and slightly inward against the left wall in the mid 10% zone. Keep pressure Medium to Hard for one beat before returning to the neutral baseline. For endomorphic practitioners, the key is even weight distribution—pressing through the thighs rather than collapsing through the arms. At five to seven inches, this action locks the left wall connection without risk of hitting too deep. Watch for her stillness or long exhale—these show satisfaction and readiness to continue.
Each keystroke—Left Lean, Left Lift, Left Drop, Right Lean, Right Lift, Right Drop—should be practiced individually before chaining them together. Think of them as musical notes you’ll later combine into melody. After every motion, return to neutral, breathe, and feel the baseline. That repetition builds control and stamina. A sample journal note may read: “Left lean shallow 80%, Light pressure, hips warmed at breath three.” This sentence records compass, depth, pressure, and feedback for tracking progress.

================================================================================================
Module three teaches how to connect the six keystrokes into one seamless rhythm. The goal is to move from isolated mechanics into a living pattern that feels smooth, repeatable, and breathable. Begin in your neutral forearm-plank baseline, the body aligned from crown to knees, the spine active but relaxed. Breathe deeply three times before moving. Inhale to lengthen through your back, exhale to settle your weight evenly across forearms and thighs. This breath anchor marks the start and end of every stroke cycle. For the endomorphic body, each breath keeps the movement grounded in the core instead of spilling into the shoulders. For a penis length between five and seven inches, this discipline maintains consistent wall contact, preventing the motion from collapsing or overreaching.
From baseline, initiate the sequence by leaning left and pressing into her right wall. Let the movement start small—a soft Angling guided by the exhale. Feel the shaft’s right edge nestle along her right wall while the underside stays flush with the south wall. At the end of that lean, hold your breath for a half-second pause, then lift your hips slightly upward while maintaining the same lean. This vertical Rocking continues pressure on the right wall while adding upward glide. Exhale through the lift, inhale as you drop the hips gently back down along the same angle. The drop deepens contact without breaking rhythm. This three-step left cycle—lean, lift, drop—forms the first half of the Egyptian Hip Slide’s logic. Pause after the drop to return to baseline, inhaling to find center again. The pause is not rest—it is the quiet moment when your body resets alignment, where you can feel whether her cues remain open or if adjustment is needed.
When she exhales softly or her hips roll toward you, that’s your signal to begin the right-side cycle. Shift your hips slightly right to press your left shaft edge into her left wall. Keep your chest still and shoulders level. Inhale to lengthen, exhale as you lean right. From that angle, lift the hips a finger’s width to create upward Rocking, dragging the shaft’s underside upward along the left wall. Maintain light to medium pressure, then drop the hips back down on the same exhale path. This deepens the mid 10% zone on her left side and finishes the second half of the stroke’s rhythm. Inhale again at the baseline to center your body and prepare for the next repetition. When done fluidly, the alternation between left and right creates a rhythm like gentle waves—pressure traveling from one wall to the other, each wave meeting the next without pause.
For the endomorphic frame, the priority is energy conservation. Let your abdomen steer the shifts, keeping shoulders and arms steady. Large bodies tend to generate more natural momentum, so each lean and lift should feel measured, never forced. Focus on smooth breath rather than power. For the five-to-seven-inch length, stay mostly in the shallow 80% zone, with brief dips into the mid 10% during the drops. This prevents strain while allowing firm wall engagement. If her breath slows and her pelvis curls toward you, that’s a cue to sustain the current angle. If her muscles tighten or her breath catches, back off to shallow and soften pressure for a few cycles before rebuilding rhythm.
Once you can chain both sides without losing alignment, the stroke becomes a continuous figure-eight of motion—weight shifting diagonally left and right while the hips Rock up and down in a gentle vertical rhythm. This pattern is what you’ll use during Flow and Pinning later, but for now, the goal is fluid coordination. Think of it like drawing an infinity symbol with your hips, anchored by breath and grounded through your forearms. Each breath closes one loop of that symbol. With repetition, your body begins to memorize the timing without conscious effort.
During early chaining, limit your sets to ten full cycles before resting. Endomorphic trainees should check for shoulder fatigue or wrist compression, adjusting elbow position closer to the ribs to reduce load. When fatigue appears, drop back to baseline, breathe deeply, and allow a full exhale before restarting. Over time, the body will learn to carry the rhythm longer without strain. A journal entry after practice might read: “Full six-stroke chain smooth, mid 10% reached, steady breath, hips aligned on eighth loop.”

================================================================================================
Module four teaches how to enter the Tracking phase for the Egyptian Hip Slide—where you test, observe, and refine the stroke through repeated shallow 80% passes. This is not about speed or endurance. It is about precision. You are defining your edges: how far you can lean, how deep the shaft can travel, how softly you can press while keeping rhythm alive. Begin in your forearm-plank baseline, spine long, hips level. Inhale to prepare, exhale to settle. This breath is your first checkpoint of awareness.
From the baseline, begin your left-lean cycle. Keep it Light, just enough to feel the right wall engage. Stay in the shallow 80%, where friction sharpens sensitivity but never grinds. Exhale through the lean, inhale to reset. Repeat three cycles, watching her breath and your own stability. In the Tracking phase, her body becomes your feedback instrument—if her breath deepens, if her pelvis tilts forward, if she releases a small sigh, your angle is correct. If she stiffens or pulls away, you’ve gone too deep or too hard. Adjust through breath, not force. For the endomorphic body, this shallow testing protects the joints and saves energy while building precise muscle memory. For the five-to-seven-inch range, this depth guarantees full wall stimulation without bottoming out.
After three left cycles, transition gently to the right. Inhale to center, exhale to lean right. Let the shaft’s left edge glide along her left wall. Stay shallow and Light again. The goal is not stimulation—it’s data collection. Each motion tells you where her body opens, where it resists, and what tempo harmonizes with her breath. The SSP loop governs this stage: Define, Hypothesize, Track, Refine. You define the wall angle, hypothesize how her body responds, track the results with your senses, then refine pressure or tempo in real time. Use your breath as a metronome. Count one full inhale-exhale as one test cycle. Run three per side, then return to baseline for two breaths of stillness to review what you noticed.
Her cues are everything. When she presses her hips slightly back toward you or lets her breath melt out in a slow exhale, it means your rhythm and depth are correct. When her body pauses or her breath shortens, you’ve likely gone off-tempo or off-angle. Adjust with a smaller lean and lighter pressure. Think of Tracking like tuning an instrument—you are listening for resonance, not volume. For the endomorphic trainee, this stage trains efficiency. The more finely you feel resistance through the abdomen and thighs, the less your arms must work. Keep your forearms anchored, shoulders quiet, and hips leading every correction.
When you notice that one side draws a stronger response—say, her breath deepens more on the right wall—note it in your mind but stay balanced in training. Both sides must be tracked equally to keep pelvic symmetry. You may discover that your right lean prefers a slower tempo or lighter pressure, while your left responds to a slightly longer stroke. Record these discoveries in short sentences after practice to build your database of feedback.
Avoid temptation to speed up. Tracking is the scientific phase, not the performance one. Every repetition should begin and end in full breath cycles with clean returns to neutral. The endomorphic frame benefits most when rhythm is slow enough for muscles to reset between actions. Fatigue will appear in the core, not the shoulders, if your alignment is correct. When it shifts to the arms, it means you’ve lost plank integrity—pause, breathe, and rebuild baseline.
To anchor the practice, run one-minute Tracking sets alternating left and right, always staying in the shallow 80%. Keep pressure Light to Medium, breath steady, and motion minimal. This teaches your body to detect the smallest cues before Flow begins. The better your tracking, the richer your flow later. End your set with three deep breaths at baseline, letting the hips relax completely to absorb what you’ve learned.
A simple journal reflection after this module might read: “Shallow 80% tracking, right wall stronger response, Medium pressure softened at third breath.” This note captures compass, depth, pressure, and feedback for ongoing refinement.
Ready to proceed to Module 5 for Egyptian Hip Slide with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


================================================================================================
Module five begins your transition into the Flow phase—the moment when Tracking transforms from observation into seamless rhythm. You already know your walls, your depth ceilings, and her breath cues. Now the task is to ride that awareness continuously, keeping every motion fluid while staying inside the 80–10–10 rule. Flow is not about power. It’s about continuity—the way each motion dissolves into the next without breaking breath, baseline, or focus.
Start in neutral forearm-plank, hips level, shoulders quiet, spine lengthened. Inhale deeply, exhale to drop your weight evenly into the floor. Your breath begins the rhythm: inhale to prepare, exhale to move. Lean left on the exhale, letting your right shaft edge slide along her right wall in the shallow 80%. Without pausing, lift the hips a finger’s width as you inhale again—this vertical Rocking elongates contact. Then exhale as you drop the hips smoothly down, guiding pressure along the same right-wall diagonal. Flow is continuous, so your next inhale immediately pulls you back through center toward the opposite side. Shift right, maintaining steady abdominal control, then repeat the lift and drop sequence. The result is a looping motion, like drawing a sideways figure eight with your pelvis.
For the endomorphic body, Flow requires control through breath and core compression. Avoid driving motion from your shoulders or lower back. Each loop should feel as if your abs are steering your hips, distributing load evenly across forearms and thighs. Endomorphic builds produce natural torque—use that momentum sparingly, focusing instead on keeping your hips gliding smoothly rather than bouncing. The body’s centerline must remain quiet even as the pelvis circles left and right. For a penis length of five to seven inches, this keeps depth within the safe shallow and mid zones, ensuring consistent contact with both walls without over-penetration. Your range of motion should be slightly shorter than a full thrust—think of it as painting along the walls, not digging toward the cervix.
Keep pressure at Medium most of the time, pulsing to Light during upward lifts and briefly to Hard during downward drops when her breath invites it. The exhale should always guide the heavier portion of the movement. This rhythm of breath-pressure pairing builds internal timing: inhale and lighten, exhale and press. You’ll know you’ve entered Flow when your breath and hers merge into a single shared tempo. Her cues—long exhales, pelvic curls, thighs pressing in—confirm that you’ve matched her rhythm. If her body stills completely, sustain your current tempo. If she moves against you, reduce amplitude slightly to stay synced.
The Flow phase should feel smooth, circular, and almost hypnotic. Imagine your hips tracing the path of a pendulum that never stops. The motion is endless, not mechanical. Every time you cross center, you reset subtly without pausing—your breath does the resetting for you. The abdominal engagement required to maintain this glide will build endurance and proprioception. For the endomorphic practitioner, this balance of effort and release prevents overheating and fatigue. Keep your breathing steady, using two full inhale-exhale cycles per loop when starting, eventually condensing to one cycle as stamina grows.
Stay within shallow 80% for your first few minutes. Once you feel stability, allow the mid 10% to enter naturally during the drop portions, but never deeper. Flow at this range stimulates her full canal length without risking discomfort. The goal is rhythm integrity—never let eagerness override smoothness. When your thighs start to tighten or your shoulders begin to shift weight, drop back to baseline for a few breaths, then re-enter Flow. This builds muscle memory while preserving joint health.
In Flow, reflection happens through sensation, not thought. When both bodies begin to move as one wave, stay there. Don’t change angles or tempo unless feedback demands it. The Flow phase is your reward for discipline during Tracking—it’s where skill becomes instinct.
A short journal note after training might read: “Figure-eight loop steady, Medium pressure, matched breath on fifth cycle.” That sentence is enough to capture the essence of your session.
Ready to proceed to Module 6 for Egyptian Hip Slide with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


================================================================================================
Module six teaches how to expand the Egyptian Hip Slide safely into the mid and deep zones—the controlled deep option that introduces pressure intelligence and depth awareness. This is the phase where you learn how to let the body reach slightly deeper without breaking rhythm or overwhelming her sensitivity. The goal is not to chase depth; it’s to master what deep contact actually does when timed with breath and guided through control.
Start in your neutral forearm-plank baseline. Keep your spine long, abs engaged, and hips balanced. Inhale to lengthen, exhale to ground. The motion begins from Flow, where your figure-eight rhythm already feels smooth and stable. On your next exhale, guide your hips left with an angling quality—Rocking through the shallow 80% zone first. As you cross center, slow slightly and let your pelvis drop a finger’s width deeper on the right wall. This movement shifts you into the mid 10%, not the full deep range yet. For the endomorphic body, keep the angle shallow—your natural power is high, and too much torque can overload the core or shoulders. Use breath to control descent. The inhale lengthens and stabilizes; the exhale applies pressure.
At mid depth, stay still for one full breath cycle. Feel how the inner wall wraps more firmly around the shaft. This is your depth checkpoint. Her cues will confirm whether you can proceed—if she exhales softly or draws her hips slightly back toward you, she’s opening. If she tightens or stills, stay at this depth and keep the motion shallow until her breath relaxes. For a 5–7 inch range, the mid 10% gives maximum internal contact without striking the cervix, so you can sustain this position longer without discomfort.
To move into the deep 10%, only proceed when lubrication and rhythm are fully established. From your mid zone, inhale to prepare and slightly lift the hips to re-lubricate the path. Exhale slowly, guiding the hips down along the same diagonal—this time extending an extra half-inch of motion until you feel a distinct inner resistance. Stop there. That resistance is your gate, not a target to push through. Maintain Medium pressure for one breath, then retreat gently back to the mid 10%. Each descent and retreat trains your nervous system to recognize safe depth boundaries automatically. Think of it as a pendulum touching the edge and returning—smooth, respectful, never forceful.
For the endomorphic trainee, the main challenge is managing inertia. Use abdominal compression to decelerate the hips as they descend. This saves joint strain and protects rhythm. If you feel pressure shift into your shoulders, reset to baseline, breathe twice, and re-enter with slower pacing. The goal is depth control without fatigue. This modulation also builds stamina—the ability to sustain long sets while preserving precision.
Stay in the deep 10% for no more than two cycles at a time. During those cycles, keep your movement minimal, focusing on controlled compression and sensory clarity. Her breath, pelvic tilt, and thigh tension will tell you when the deep angle hits correctly. If she rolls her pelvis forward or exhales audibly, you’ve found resonance. Hold for one breath, then return to mid. The alternation between mid and deep zones becomes its own rhythm—mid for motion, deep for grounding.
As you practice, remember that the deeper range is not about dominance but connection through stability. When you reach the edge and pause, her body reads that stillness as confidence. That pause is where the deepest sensations awaken. Never force or jab. The most effective deep penetration feels anchored, not aggressive.
Finish each session by returning to shallow 80%, then baseline. Let your hips rest, inhale deeply, and exhale to release any residual tension. This teaches your system to close cleanly after deep engagement.
A journal note for this module might read: “Mid/deep alternation steady, Hard pressure brief, right wall deeper resonance on exhale.”
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for Egyptian Hip Slide with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


================================================================================================
Module seven teaches how to master the Pinning phase—the precision control that holds her in place post-orgasm and invites multiple waves without losing rhythm. Pinning is the art of staying inside her while her body trembles, using micro-angle, pressure, and tempo shifts to restart the circuit without retreating. It is quiet, exact, and deliberate. The purpose here is not thrusting—it is anchoring.
Begin in your neutral forearm-plank baseline, breath steady. Re-enter Flow on the shallow 80%, keeping movement smooth until you sense her release building. The moment she peaks—breath catches, thighs clamp, hips press in—stop all large motion. Stay connected. This stillness is the Pin. Inhale through your nose to stabilize, exhale through your mouth to drop your weight evenly. Feel her pulse around you. This is when you begin the SSP sequence: Observe, Tweak, Test. Observation comes first—track the rhythm of her breath, the tightness of her inner muscles, and how her pelvis moves on its own. Do nothing yet; just match your breathing to hers.
When her exhale lengthens, start the Tweak. Shift your hips a half-inch left in a subtle Angling move, maintaining contact along her inner wall. Pressure stays Light at first, paired with an exhale. Inhale, then slide the opposite way. This micro-lateral motion re-awakens sensation without over-stimulating. For a 5–7 inch range, this side-to-side sweep is ideal because it massages both walls evenly while staying within the safe shallow-mid envelope. Endomorphic strength can easily overshoot here, so rely on abdominal engagement, not force. Keep your arms quiet and let your breath pace the slide.
If she exhales audibly or arches into you, advance to the Test phase. Introduce a slow Rocking rhythm—a forward glide no more than a finger’s width deeper, then back to baseline, paired with Hard pressure for a single breath. Return immediately to Medium. This one-breath pulse tells you whether her body is ready for another climb. If she curls her pelvis upward or breath quickens, stay with the rhythm. If she stiffens or pulls away, reduce amplitude and return to stillness until her breathing evens. Each loop through Observe, Tweak, Test should take roughly three breath cycles before resetting to baseline.
Throughout Pinning, your goal is stability through sensitivity. Keep your forearms evenly grounded, shoulders loose, core tight. For endomorphic builds, fatigue may arise in the lower back if weight drifts forward. Prevent this by drawing your navel toward your spine and keeping hips level with shoulders. Pinning demands patience more than stamina—let the body’s own pulse guide timing.
Pressure control follows the same 80–10–10 logic. Eighty percent of the time, remain in Light to Medium contact, letting her recover and rise again. Ten percent of the time, introduce short Hard pulses to spark new contractions. The remaining ten percent is pure stillness—no motion, only breath synchronization. The alternation between stillness and micro-motion teaches your nervous system how to maintain connection during prolonged pleasure cycles.
If executed correctly, you will feel her rhythm restart beneath you—small contractions building again after stillness. That is the sign your Pin is working. Continue cycling gently until her breathing finds a second wave. At that moment, either stay with the same micro-angle or shift compass slightly to a new wall to explore fresh response. Never disengage fully until both bodies are calm and breath is steady.
When ending, retreat slowly to shallow 80% and pause there for two full breaths before withdrawing completely. This teaches the body closure discipline—finishing without collapse.
A sample journal tag: “Left-wall Pin, Light→Hard pulse @3rd breath, second wave confirmed.”
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for Egyptian Hip Slide with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


================================================================================================


Module eight brings everything together into a four-week integration plan for the Egyptian Hip Slide. This is where isolated technique turns into embodied rhythm. You will use this time to sharpen consistency, develop muscle memory, and learn how to sustain Flow under fatigue. The focus is discipline and awareness—refining every cue, from baseline entry to deep gating, until your body performs it automatically.
Begin each session with your neutral forearm-plank setup. Hold for two slow breaths to center your balance. The Egyptian Hip Slide thrives on repetition, so your goal is frequency, not force. Across the four weeks, you will build from short, precise drills into extended Flow sequences. Start by revisiting each keystroke individually—Rocking, Angling, and controlled torque release—treating them as warm-ups. Three or four minutes of isolated movement at shallow depth prepares the nervous system and stabilizes your pressure sensitivity. Each time you move, feel your hips carve the figure-eight and your abs manage torque, never your arms.
In the first week, your practice remains in the shallow 80%. This is about rhythm stability and joint alignment. For the endomorphic trainee, this prevents overloading the shoulders and spine while developing endurance in the core. Keep your breath consistent—inhale through the lift, exhale through the press. Each session should last around ten minutes, alternating between motion and rest every three cycles. Your goal is quiet consistency, where your breathing stays even and the hips never break flow.
By week two, layer in mid-depth testing. Use the SSP loop to track wall response—Observe, Tweak, Test. Alternate between shallow and mid 10% in small controlled sets. End each session by returning to baseline and noting one key variable in your journal. An entry might read: “Mid-right wall pull, Medium pressure steady, improved torque control.” These short notes teach your mind to see data rather than guesswork.
In week three, shift toward endurance Flow. This is where you extend sequences up to twenty continuous breath cycles, holding rhythm through fatigue. Focus on relaxation in the upper body and precision in hip angle. Endomorphic stamina responds best to slow progression—when fatigue builds, drop to baseline and rest for two breaths before re-entry. That rest hygiene prevents joint compression and maintains energy across multiple sessions.
Week four introduces deep control and Pinning transitions. Alternate mid-depth Flow with brief deep 10% pulses. Keep the same 80–10–10 pressure balance: Light to Medium most of the time, with short Hard compressions only during breath-synchronized moments. When her cues confirm readiness—pelvic curl, deeper exhale—experiment with entering the Pin phase. Observe, adjust, and hold stillness with full presence. This final layer develops sensitivity and confidence. You are not chasing reaction—you are sculpting connection.
Throughout the month, your primary checkpoint is the quality of recovery. Each session ends in baseline, hips still, breath slow. Allow one full rest day every four practice days to prevent overtraining the core and lower back. The purpose of this program is not exhaustion but neural adaptation—rewiring control until it feels effortless.
By the end of four weeks, your Egyptian Hip Slide will feel integrated—each keystroke moving through you as one unified wave. Pressure, angle, and breath will align naturally, and your body will read her responses instinctively. You will have learned the difference between motion and mastery: motion uses energy, mastery redirects it.
A journal summary for completion: “Full sequence 20 cycles, mid→deep flow seamless, breath steady, minimal fatigue.”
