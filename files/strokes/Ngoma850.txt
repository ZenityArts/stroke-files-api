Module 1 for The Ngoma is about setting posture and body setup so you can execute every later keystroke with control, clarity, and safety. Your baseline is a forearm-plank with knees down on the canvas, hips supported, and spine long. For an endomorph build, this setup distributes weight comfortably across broader hips and shoulders, but it also means you must be disciplined in alignment so you don’t sag into the lower back or overload the wrists. Keep the elbows under the shoulders, forearms pressed into the surface, and hands relaxed. Inhale to anchor, exhale to settle. This is your neutral reset—the place you must return to before chaining any motion.
From this position, depth control is everything. With a shaft above seven inches, you must respect the 80–10–10 rule. Most work stays shallow, in the top 80% of her canal. Mid-zone touches are your controlled accents, and deep penetration must remain rare, gated by her breath, lubrication, and pelvic openness. Treat the deep 10% like a locked door you knock on gently, never kick open. Use Light to Medium pressure on shallow entries, exhaling as you move forward, inhaling as you return to baseline. Medium to Hard should only be tested in the shallow space when her body pulls you in—hips pressing, breath deepening, stillness holding you there.
The neutral plank also protects stamina. For a larger frame, your core must carry weight so the spine stays aligned and the stroke stays clear. Rocking comes from the hips, not from collapsing your chest or shoulders. Angling comes from tilts at the pelvis, not from twisting the spine. Think of your body like a lever balanced over her—the more you keep the lever steady, the clearer her walls feel under your shaft. A single metaphor to anchor this: imagine balancing a tray of water on your back. If you sag or twist too far, the tray tips. If you stay level, you can angle or rock your hips underneath without spilling.
Clarity on posture also prevents strain over time. Keep knees cushioned and wide enough to give a strong base. Keep breath steady, syncing each action to an inhale or exhale so you never jerk or lose rhythm. When you feel fatigue in the wrists or shoulders, reset to baseline before continuing. She will show you her comfort through cues: a soft exhale, a pelvic curl, or stillness tells you you’re aligned and safe. A sharp inhale, hips pulling back, or tension in her thighs means depth or angle has gone too far. Adjust by easing pressure or slowing tempo.
A simple journal line from this orientation phase might read: “Neutral plank held steady, shallow entry, Medium pressure, hips pressed in at rep five.” This trains you to record the relationship between alignment, depth, and her feedback.

Module 2 for The Ngoma moves from holding neutral baseline into the very first keystroke patterns that shape the stroke. These keystrokes are about angling the shaft inside her canal by tilting the hips, not by twisting the spine. Begin from the forearm-plank position, neutral and steady. On the inhale, prepare. On the exhale, shift your hips slightly left so that the head of the penis points right, grazing the right wall at shallow depth. This is an Angling keystroke—shallow zone, Light to Medium pressure. Return to center with the next breath. Then repeat, letting the shaft track the same right wall path again before returning to center. She will feel this as a teasing press on her right side, which can make her hips curl toward you or her breath deepen. Watch for that stilling or pressing in—those cues tell you the wall contact is sharp enough. If her breath catches or she stiffens, ease pressure or slow the tilt.
Reset to neutral, then perform the same pattern mirrored. On the inhale, prepare. On the exhale, tilt hips to the right so the head points left, grazing her left wall at shallow depth. Light to Medium pressure is enough here, though with your length you must stay mindful—never drive the angle deeper than she invites. Return to center, then repeat, keeping your plank steady so the motion is isolated to the hips. She will feel this as mirrored attention, a balancing stroke that makes both walls aware of your presence.
Because of your above-average length, this sequence must remain in the shallow 80% zone. Treat the keystrokes as tracing brushes on the walls, not as full thrusts. For an endomorph body, the broad base gives you leverage, but it also means fatigue can set in if you overload the shoulders. Keep exhaling through each tilt so your core, not your arms, carries the motion. This protects stamina and makes the wall contact clearer. Imagine your hips as a dial that turns left or right without disturbing the rest of the machine—precise, deliberate, never sloppy.
The rhythm phase here is Tracking. You are mapping her right and left walls, noting which one she breathes deeper into, which one she presses against. These cues tell you which side will later crave harder contact. Journaling might read: “Left tilt, shallow, Medium pressure, hips pressing in at rep three.” That note anchors wall, depth, pressure, and feedback all in one line.
This module builds sensitivity and control. Without it, later chaining into grinds or lifts will lack clarity. Once you can execute clean tilts left and right from neutral plank, you will be ready to chain them into Flow in Module 3.

=======================================================================================










Module 3 for The Ngoma is about chaining the keystrokes into a full rhythm that carries its own logic and pressure cycle. You begin again from the neutral forearm-plank baseline, shoulders steady and core tight. The left and right tilts you learned in Module 2 now become alternating beats. On one exhale, angle left, brushing the right wall at shallow depth. Inhale back to center. Next exhale, angle right, brushing the left wall. Inhale back to center. Each return to baseline is critical; without it the pattern blurs and loses precision. This is a Rocking chain of Angling keystrokes, and when linked, it begins to feel like a side-to-side sway rather than isolated drills.
The sequence runs best in sets of four to six cycles, keeping the motion even. With your above-seven-inch length, you must remain disciplined in depth—never deeper than shallow 80% until her hips or breath give clear invitation. The stroke should feel to her like a dance of alternating pressure, right wall then left wall, each one asking her body to choose which side it wants more. If she curls her hips or presses into one side, that is feedback—your SSP loop tells you to note it, refine the angle, and repeat. Her cues will not always be vocal; often they show as a deeper exhale or a moment of stillness where she holds you inside.
For an endomorph frame, endurance depends on using core leverage rather than shoulder strain. Imagine your hips as a pendulum swinging side to side; your arms remain firm, carrying load through bone alignment instead of muscle grind. Breathing anchors every cycle—inhaling to reset, exhaling to tilt. This rhythm not only preserves stamina but also deepens your mapping of her interior walls.
Neuroplastic progression comes from the shift between isolated keystrokes and the flowing stroke. At first, you may feel the motion as conscious and mechanical. After enough cycles, the brain wires it into a reflex pattern. That is when the stroke gains speed and subtlety without conscious strain. By journaling after each set—“Right wall pressed, hips curled in, Medium pressure, 5 cycles clean”—you reinforce what worked and give your nervous system clear reference points.
The Ngoma only becomes itself in this chaining phase. Without clean sequencing, the wall grazes are just drills. With it, the stroke becomes rhythmic, teasing, and controlled, preparing you for Tracking in Module 4 where you will refine which wall or angle she truly responds to most.

Module 4 for The Ngoma is where you run the stroke in its Tracking phase, focusing almost entirely on the shallow 80% zone. Your goal is not intensity but clarity. From forearm-plank baseline, you begin the alternating tilts as in Module 3, but you now slow them to about one full breath cycle per tilt. Inhale as you return to center, exhale as you angle into one wall. This pacing makes each keystroke into a probe, testing how she reacts to pressure against right and left diagonals. Rocking and Angling remain the qualities, but now your job is to form hypotheses—does she open more on the right wall, or does her breath deepen when you press into the left?
Tracking always runs with light to medium pressure. Too much force clouds the signal, especially with your above-seven-inch length where deep leverage is always present even when unintentional. For an endomorph frame, avoid sinking shoulders or collapsing the chest, as this loads joints and shortens your range. Keep your spine aligned, hips steady, arms firm—let the tilt come from the pelvis rather than the upper body. Imagine the motion as a pendulum swinging wide but slow, mapping the walls without flooding her with stimulation.
Each wall press should stay shallow, the head of your penis making clear contact without advancing into mid-zone unless she explicitly shifts to invite you. The cues to watch are simple: a deeper breath, a pelvic curl, her hips pressing back into you, or her body going still as if she wants to hold you in place. These signals are the data points of the SSP loop. You define a hypothesis—“she breathes deeper on the left wall.” You test it with three to four cycles pressing that wall. You track her responses. If they fade, you refine angle or tempo and test again.
Journaling keeps the loop alive. After a set, you might write a simple one-liner such as, “Left wall at shallow 80%, Medium pressure, pelvic curl after rep three.” This shorthand builds a personal map of her body and keeps you from guessing next time. Training at this phase is not about finishing but about building sensitivity. It conditions your nervous system to spot subtle changes while keeping you in control of depth and stamina.
This Tracking practice transforms the stroke into a diagnostic tool. The Ngoma is no longer just motion; it becomes a way to learn her, wall by wall, breath by breath. By staying in shallow 80% you protect her body and yours, preparing for later Flow and Pinning where pressure and tempo will rise.

=======================================================================================






Module 5 for The Ngoma is where you step out of shallow Tracking and allow Flow to take hold. You are no longer testing each wall in isolation; now you are weaving them into a rhythm that she can ride. The stroke still begins from neutral plank, hips steady, shoulders stacked, spine aligned. From this baseline you ease into alternating tilts, first left then right, but instead of pausing for analysis you carry them forward at a steady tempo, letting breath match movement—inhale on center, exhale as you drive into the wall. This continuity is what transforms keystrokes into Flow.
In Flow, you live mostly in the shallow 80% with the option to flirt into mid-zone if her cues clearly invite. With your above-seven-inch length, this means carefully gating entry: you must soften the angle and keep hips hinged forward rather than dropping weight, otherwise you risk slipping too deep too soon. For the endomorph frame, Flow requires conscious stamina pacing. Use your mass to keep rhythm stable rather than explosive. Think of it as drumming a beat on a stretched drumhead—you want resonance, not collapse. Pressure ranges from light to medium, with only brief moments of firm drive if her hips pull you in.
Her signals will tell you when Flow is locked in. The breath smooths out, her hips begin to pulse back in rhythm with you, or she goes into stillness as if she doesn’t want the loop broken. Your job is to sustain this consistency. Flow is fragile if you rush; breaking tempo or pressing too deep will snap it. Exhale steadily through each wall contact, inhaling back to center. Each cycle should feel like a wave rolling across her canal, left to right, center to south, never crashing too hard.
Flow with The Ngoma is where orgasm often brews without force. By staying in shallow dominance and only teasing mid, you build her arousal in layers, letting the alternation carve nerve pathways across both side walls and the front shelf. If she begins to tense or clench, lighten and shorten the arc until she opens again. If she softens into you, sustain the same rhythm until her breath or hips change. A journal note after practice might read: “Right wall flow, shallow to mid, medium pressure, hips started pulsing at cycle seven.”
This is the first time the stroke feels like music instead of drills. You are no longer charting maps; you are playing them. Flow trains endurance, consistency, and the ability to keep her body entrained in a loop that doesn’t break under pressure. Once mastered here, the deep option of Module 6 can open safely without losing control.

Module 6 for The Ngoma is where you cautiously open the door to the mid and deep zones, always treating them as optional expansions rather than mandatory targets. The baseline remains the same—forearm plank, shoulders stacked, wrists aligned, hips supported by your endomorph frame—but here you modulate entry so that the above-seven-inch length does not overwhelm. Think of the deep zone as a locked chamber; you only enter when her body gives you the key. This means breath smooths, hips press upward, or she curls her pelvis to meet you. Without those cues, you remain in shallow Flow.
To approach depth, begin by softening the angle of your Rocking keystrokes. Instead of a sharp tilt left or right, hinge slightly forward so the head traces lower diagonals into mid depth. Inhale to prepare on the center reset, exhale as you slide into mid with medium pressure, then withdraw back to shallow before her body tenses. At no point should you drive hard or lose rhythm; depth is explored by melting into it, not pushing. For an endomorph frame, this is where weight control matters most—keep chest buoyant, hips moving from hinge rather than drop, and never let your belly collapse onto her.
When her cues align—hips pressing in, breath lengthening, or a still body asking for more—you can allow brief entries toward the deep 10%. Use only light to medium pressure at first, letting the shaft skim the back wall rather than thud against cervix. Exhale through contact, pause for a half-breath if she stills, and return to shallow on the inhale. This pendulum quality reassures her body that deep touch is not a trap. If she softens into you, you can hold for one or two beats in deep before flowing back out. If she clenches or breath shortens, retreat immediately to shallow until she relaxes again.
With length above seven inches, gating is essential. The head should always lead the angle diagonally downward to avoid direct vertical collision with cervix. Think of deep as brushing the back wall with the paintbrush tip, never slamming it flat. Endomorph leverage supports this by letting you use weight distribution rather than thrust force. Sustain rhythm by exhaling into depth and inhaling back to neutral. A journal shorthand after practice might read: “Southwest diagonal, mid depth, light pressure, hips pressed in at cycle five.”
This module teaches you that deep is not about dominance but about trust and clarity. The Ngoma’s full rhythm gains power from alternating shallow Flow with rare, precise deep touches that feel like discoveries. By honoring depth as a privilege, not a demand, you preserve her openness and protect your stamina. Endomorph structure and longer length make this discipline even more vital, ensuring each deep entry enhances connection rather than breaking it.

=======================================================================================




Module 7 for The Ngoma is where you learn to pin her arousal after an orgasm and spark multiples through precise micro-adjustments. You begin from the same forearm plank baseline, letting your weight spread evenly so joints stay protected and hips hover with clarity. At this stage, the stroke shifts from wide rhythm to refined control. The Ngoma’s Rocking and Angling keystrokes become tools for subtle pressure shifts rather than big sweeps. Think of this as tuning a guitar string—you are not strumming anymore, you are adjusting tension until the note vibrates again.
When she releases, her body often stills or her breath drops low. This is not a signal to stop; it is a signal to narrow focus. From shallow 80% entry, tilt hips slightly left or right so the head brushes the opposite wall with light to medium pressure. Inhale on reset, exhale through contact, and watch for her hips curling back into you. If she breathes deeper or presses down, maintain that angle and shorten tempo to two-beat bursts. If she tightens or pulls away, retreat to neutral and reset. Endomorph stability gives you the advantage here—you can hold angle without wobbling, letting her trust the pressure is consistent. With length above seven inches, always gate depth, keeping mid and deep to brief touches only when she softens into them.
The grind sequence of The Ngoma—north to south sweep—becomes especially powerful post-orgasm. Use it with pelvis pressed in, shallow depth, and light pressure. Exhale on the left grind, inhale on the north, exhale on the south, then pause in center. This sequence can rekindle clitoral and wall contact simultaneously, often sparking another wave. She may show this by clutching at you, arching, or gasping on the south drop. Reflect by pausing half a breath, then either continue the grind loop or switch back to Rocking diagonals depending on cues.
Your aim is not to create endless motion but to run the SSP loop in real time—observe her shift, tweak angle or tempo, test with two or three cycles, then refine again. Each mini-test is like striking a match; some flame instantly, others need oxygen. Journaling after training might read: “Left Rock, shallow, light pressure, hips curled in on rep three, grind north-south restarted flow.” This shorthand keeps you tracking which adjustments worked in her body.
By pinning arousal with keystroke precision, The Ngoma turns from a rhythm into a conversation of touch. Each micro-adjustment tells her body she is not being rushed, she is being read. For an endomorph frame with longer length, this means discipline in holding shallow walls steady, patience in not over-driving deep, and stamina in sustaining stillness when her body soaks in the pressure. Multiples come not from force but from exact calibration at the edge of her surrender.

Module 8 for The Ngoma is about weaving everything you’ve trained into a full plan you can follow week by week. The aim is not to rush mastery but to build it layer by layer so that keystrokes become automatic, breath anchors set your rhythm, and the whole stroke lives in your body without hesitation. Think of this module as your training calendar written in motion, guiding you from orientation to full flow and pinning strategies with clarity.
In the first week, your focus is posture and baseline. Set yourself in forearm plank daily, no more than ten minutes at a time, making sure wrists, shoulders, hips, and spine align. Each session, rehearse neutral entry at shallow 80% depth with light to medium pressure, using breath cycles to prepare and reset. Journal short notes after each set, like “baseline clear, hips steady, no joint strain.” This foundation prevents injury and gives you wall clarity later.
In the second week, isolate the keystrokes. Practice leaning left to point right, then return to center; repeat to the opposite side. Keep movements broad enough to feel a full Rocking/Angling effect but never so far that your hips twist out of line. For an endomorph frame, you have the benefit of leverage—you can stabilize without over-torquing joints—but stamina must be managed. Work in sets of six to eight reps per side, resting between cycles. With length above seven inches, always gate depth shallow to mid, noting if the canal feels tighter or if partner cues suggest a need for gentler angles.
The third week blends the grind sequence and the vertical lift keystroke. Grind left, north, south, then return to center, always keeping contact pressed in and adjusting breath with each sweep. On lifts, keep weight forward so the broad top shelf massages shallow and withdraws without breaking entry. This trains you to use vertical keystrokes for contrast and reset. For an endomorph, manage rest carefully; every three or four cycles, come back to neutral baseline to prevent lower back strain. Journaling could read, “grind sequence sparked curl, vertical lift pause reset her breath.”
By the fourth week, chain everything into The Ngoma rhythm. Start shallow entry, Rock left twice, Rock right twice, grind sequence three beats, lift once, then reset. Inhale before each change of direction, exhale through each contact. Do this in cycles of two minutes, rest, then repeat. Observe cues—hips pressing in, a curl, or a stilling body—and adapt by running SSP in real time: observe, tweak angle or tempo, test two to three reps, refine. With your body type and length, emphasize patience in shallow and mid zones, allowing deep only if her hips soften and invite it.
At this stage, you should feel each keystroke lock into rhythm, the way drumbeats make a song. Journaling anchors reflection and keeps progress measurable. An example: “South grind, shallow, medium pressure, hips pressed in at cycle two, switched to Rock right, breath deepened.” This shorthand builds a library of what works. Rest hygiene matters most for an endomorph: cap each session at fifteen to twenty minutes, include recovery days, and stay conscious of joint load. Over time, this plan turns practice into instinct, and instinct into mastery.
