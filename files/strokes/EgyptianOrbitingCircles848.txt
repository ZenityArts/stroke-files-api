Module 1 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles teaches your body how to hold steady control over posture, load, and breathing so you can build precise circular motion later without pain or loss of depth clarity. Start in a forearm plank with your elbows directly beneath your shoulders, forearms flat, and hands lightly clasped. Keep your core drawn in and your lower belly engaged. For an endomorph build, the goal is to distribute your weight evenly through your hips and thighs instead of collapsing forward into your shoulders. With a penis under five inches, every bit of pelvic angle matters—your clarity comes from control, not thrust size. Focus on keeping your hips one fist-width above the floor and your chest just slightly forward so your spine stays long. Inhale through your nose to brace, exhale through your mouth to sink into neutral.
From this neutral baseline, rock your pelvis forward toward what would be the 12 o’clock wall, using the exhale to guide motion and the inhale to pull back toward center. This rocking movement is your foundation; it will later become part of the circular path. Keep the pressure light in this phase, imagining your hips drawing small half-moons in the air. For the endomorph body, engage your glutes instead of driving with the lower back—this protects your joints and gives you more endurance. Stay mostly in the shallow 80% zone. You are not pushing for depth yet; you are shaping control.
Next, shift your weight side to side to feel the lateral compass lines—9 o’clock and 3 o’clock. Move through your hips, not your knees, maintaining that neutral plank baseline between each sway. Each shift should feel like drawing a wide arc along your lower pelvis. The shallow motion allows your core to stay engaged and builds clarity of direction. With a shorter shaft, staying light and mobile helps you trace fuller orbits later without overextending. Use a medium breath pattern: inhale on center, exhale as you glide to either side.
Return to baseline after each sequence. This pause is sacred; it resets your nervous system and keeps you from building bad habits. When fatigue builds, endomorphs should widen their stance to protect knee and shoulder joints and drop to their knees for rest hygiene before resuming. This practice teaches you to value precision over intensity. A single clear arc held under breath control teaches more than a hundred rushed ones.
In your journal, capture the feeling with one simple line like “Neutral → Left arc → Breath steady@10.” This shorthand marks how your body tracked stability and lets you reference it during later SSP cycles.

==========================================================================================================
Module 2 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles teaches you the core keystrokes that form the orbit itself—the simple, repeatable movements that later combine into a smooth circular stroke. Each keystroke has a clear body action, pressure zone, compass direction, and breath anchor. Your job here is to train them one by one until your body can perform them in rhythm without tension. For an endomorph body, keep your stance slightly wider for balance and joint protection. With a penis below five inches, precision of angle replaces depth; your power comes from controlled rocking and clean transitions, not from penetration force. Every keystroke starts and ends from the same neutral forearm-plank baseline—hips hovering just above the floor, core tight, spine straight, shoulders relaxed.
The first keystroke is the Forward Rock. From baseline, inhale through your nose, then exhale as you drive your hips slightly forward along the 12 o’clock line, pressing into the shallow 80% zone. This is not a thrust but a controlled lean that lengthens the pelvic line. You should feel light pressure across the pubic ridge and lower abs, not strain in the back. As you inhale, return to neutral. Endomorphs should use glute engagement rather than abdominal drive to prevent lower-back fatigue. The cue to watch for later in a partner is stillness and a deeper breath, which shows the wall is properly met.
The second keystroke is the Lateral Sweep. From neutral, glide your hips right to the 3 o’clock wall, keeping your body level and your breath steady. Exhale through the motion and inhale on the way back. You are teaching your hips to control side pressure without lifting or twisting. The sensation should travel through your outer thigh and obliques, creating a diagonal torque that helps stabilize orbiting later. For the left side, mirror the move toward 9 o’clock. For an endomorph, keep knees wider to prevent hip compression; for a shorter shaft, emphasize pelvic angle at the end of each sweep to exaggerate sensation.
The third keystroke is the Diagonal Push, connecting the forward and lateral paths into a single cross-angle line toward 1:30 or 10:30 on your internal compass. Start from neutral, inhale, then exhale as you drive hips diagonally forward-right, holding the pressure in the shallow band but grazing the mid 10% briefly at the peak. This trains your pelvic control to find intermediate walls between cardinal points. Keep pressure medium and rhythm slow—around one full breath per motion. For shorter anatomy, the diagonal path enhances contact area rather than chasing depth.
The fourth keystroke is the Back Pull, which completes the circle. From the forward edge of your diagonal push, inhale and draw your hips slightly back along the 6 o’clock line, letting your abs contract and spine stay long. You are not retreating out of contact but gliding along the floor of the orbit. This move will teach you how to close the loop of the Egyptian circle. For endomorphs, maintain firm abdominal engagement and keep the neck relaxed; this reduces upper-body strain during repetitions.
Practice these four keystrokes in slow cycles, always returning to neutral between them. One breath per move is your baseline tempo: inhale to prepare, exhale through the motion, inhale to return. The sequence should feel like tracing the four corners of a diamond with your hips, each side equal and deliberate. The walls you’ve mapped—12, 3, 6, and 9—become the architecture of the orbit. Later modules will merge them into continuous motion, but for now, your focus is clarity and control.
If you feel tension in your shoulders or lower back, reset and drop to your knees for a rest pause. Endomorphs should prioritize joint comfort and steady breathing over force. Remember, the precision of these keystrokes is what creates the illusion of endless circular motion later, even with limited length. Journal your feeling in one shorthand line such as “Forward→Right→Back→Left smooth@8.” This is your record of rhythm and breath control.

==========================================================================================================
Module 3 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles teaches you how to chain the keystrokes into a single, fluid motion that feels like a slow, continuous orbit. You are no longer isolating movements. You are merging them into a rhythmic loop where each transition blends seamlessly into the next. The goal is to move without breaking contact or losing the compass sense of direction. Begin again in your forearm plank neutral baseline, elbows stacked under shoulders, hips a fist-width above the floor, spine aligned. For an endomorph, keep knees slightly wider than hip-width and toes planted to help anchor the orbit. With a penis below five inches, the success of this module comes from maintaining precise angle control and consistent wall contact, not from deep penetration. The orbit is the art of staying close, tracing a circle that feels infinite.
Start by combining the Forward Rock and the Right Sweep. Exhale as your hips drive gently along the 12 o’clock wall, then inhale halfway through as you arc into the 3 o’clock direction without pausing. The transition should feel like the top-right quadrant of a clock face. You are teaching your body how to curve instead of pivot. Keep your abs taut and let your glutes guide the arc. The motion should trace a smooth curve instead of a straight thrust. Endomorphs will feel this as a roll through the hips—think of polishing a coin on a table. Stay shallow, 80% zone, with light to medium pressure and even breath.
Now continue the circle through the Back Pull and Left Sweep. From the 3 o’clock line, inhale as your hips glide diagonally back toward 6 o’clock, then exhale softly as you round into 9 o’clock. You are completing the lower half of the circle, connecting the path without stops. The sensation should stay grounded and steady. For the shorter shaft, focus on the shape of the arc more than depth. The key is to maintain contact pressure along the front pelvic ridge rather than chasing length. The circle’s integrity depends on breath pacing: one full inhale-exhale per orbit keeps your nervous system calm and your control sharp.
When all four quadrants begin to link smoothly—Forward Rock, Right Sweep, Back Pull, Left Sweep—you should feel the continuous orbit forming beneath your hips. The circle should have no edges or corners; your pelvis should float as if suspended on a shallow wave. Keep the motion compact, under control, and consistent. Endomorphs will benefit from slightly slowing tempo to manage load and keep shoulder pressure balanced. Never let your elbows flare; they are your stabilizers.
Each full orbit should feel like you’re drawing energy outward from your core, spiraling it around, and returning it to center. The Egyptian orbit isn’t about spinning fast—it’s about constancy. The circular path teaches your nervous system to sustain sensation, rhythm, and alignment all at once. Keep pressure light to medium throughout; if your lower back tenses, drop into neutral baseline, breathe deeply, and restart. Practice ten continuous orbits, rest, then repeat. Your body learns through repetition, not force.
Journal one shorthand line like “Orbit full smooth@10→breath steady.” This lets you track how continuous the circle felt and whether breath held or flowed. When that circle starts to feel natural and effortless, you’ve built the muscle memory needed for the next stage—tracking and refining under SSP logic.

==========================================================================================================
Module 4 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles begins your Tracking Phase—the moment when repetition turns into data. You are no longer just performing orbits. You are observing them. This module activates the SSP loop: define, hypothesize, track, and refine. The goal is to find your natural shallow wall at 80% depth and teach your body to detect how angle and breath change the feeling of pressure. Begin in your forearm plank baseline. Elbows under shoulders, spine long, hips a fist-width above the floor. Keep your knees slightly wider than your hips for balance. For the endomorph frame, this stance protects the lower back and distributes body weight through the thighs. For a penis below five inches, staying in the shallow 80% zone maximizes surface contact and clarity—you will read walls through pressure, not penetration.
Start by defining your orbit’s shallow wall. Perform three orbits slowly, exhaling through each forward curve. Feel where the pressure begins to fade and where it peaks. That point of steady pressure before drop-off is your shallow wall. Once you locate it, hypothesize how a change in pelvic tilt might alter the pressure pattern. Slightly angle your hips down one degree and perform three more orbits, still breathing through the motion. Notice if pressure increases or scatters. For an endomorph, this small tilt should come from glute activation, not lumbar bending. This prevents joint fatigue and keeps motion controlled.
Now track consistency. Run ten continuous orbits with a full breath per cycle. Inhale during the back half, exhale through the forward curve. Watch for small changes in sensation, especially where the orbit touches 12 o’clock and 6 o’clock. If pressure flickers or breaks, it means your baseline alignment drifted. Pause in neutral, inhale deeply, then restart. Tracking is about awareness, not endurance. When the rhythm holds steady for all ten, you’ve found the foundation to refine.
Next, test micro-adjustments. In the shallow orbit, shift pressure slightly toward 1:30 on your internal compass—just a breath-width adjustment. Keep the orbit intact. Then shift back to center. These gentle tests train your proprioception to sense which compass angle delivers the cleanest contact. For the shorter anatomy, these tiny corrections are everything—they turn limited range into full articulation. Endomorphs should monitor fatigue signals in shoulders; when the upper body starts to sag, return to baseline and rest before continuing.
During each ten-cycle set, observe physical cues: breath staying even, no shoulder shake, hips gliding smooth, no arch in the lower back. Internally, note whether your orbit feels like one continuous glide or if there’s drag near any wall. The Tracking phase is like tuning an instrument—minute adjustments in angle and timing make the entire system hum. You are training your nervous system to recognize perfect mechanical alignment by feel.
After each set, close your eyes in baseline, inhale deeply through your nose, exhale through your mouth, and record your shorthand reflection. Example: “1:30 wall holds steady@10.” Over time, these entries become your data map of what works for your body. Tracking transforms your orbit from guesswork to science. The better you measure, the smoother your mastery grows.

==========================================================================================================
Module 5 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles brings you into the Flow Phase. Here, you let the motion sustain itself without conscious correction. You are moving through control into continuity—where breath, muscle, and rhythm become one. Flow is trained in the shallow 80% and, when the body stays relaxed, can brush into the mid 10%. For an endomorph, that means grounding your mass evenly and pacing your breath slower than usual to manage joint load. With a penis below five inches, the priority is seamless orbit pressure rather than range—what she feels later is consistency and heat, not size. Flow teaches you to stay inside the circle long enough for your nervous system to hold rhythm without interruption.
Begin from your neutral forearm-plank baseline. Inhale through your nose, exhale through your mouth, and glide into your first orbit. Keep your attention low in your hips, not in your chest or shoulders. Each full orbit should last the length of a slow breath—inhale through the back half, exhale through the front. The inhale draws your hips toward 6 o’clock, the exhale pushes through 12. This creates a steady pulse without stops. Endomorphs must use their core to keep the hips lifted slightly and spine neutral to avoid overloading wrists and shoulders. If you feel compression, widen your knees.
Let your rhythm settle into a gentle roll. Picture your hips tracing a coin-sized circle on a smooth surface. The shallow orbit should feel fluid, the contact never breaking. Your internal focus is on the outer walls of the orbit, not the center—this keeps motion wide and pressure even. If breath holds or the motion jerks, reset to neutral and restart. Flow cannot be forced; it emerges when tension disappears.
Once you sustain ten orbits without losing rhythm, experiment with a slight increase in tempo. Do not rush; let the momentum build from the breath, not the muscles. The moment your hips begin to glide without thought, you are entering Flow. Stay in that zone for at least a minute. For a shorter anatomy, staying light and gliding across the front pelvic ridge maintains constant stimulation, even without deep entry. The goal is to generate a steady pulse of pressure rather than chasing depth.
During longer Flow cycles, endomorphs should monitor heat buildup in shoulders and wrists. If fatigue sets in, drop to knees for one breath, then resume. Rest hygiene matters—short pauses keep technique clean. Each return to orbit should feel like re-entering a familiar groove, smoother each time. Flow refines endurance through softness, not force.
When Flow stabilizes, add a single sensory cue: listen to your breath rhythm. The steadiness of sound is your indicator of continuity. If your breathing sounds uneven, your motion has broken. Reclaim it by slowing down. Flow is harmony between internal rhythm and external glide. The SSP framework is now passive—your awareness simply observes.
Finish each session with a journal note like “Flow steady@60s, no tension.” That single line marks the transition from deliberate to instinctive movement. Once your body can hold Flow effortlessly, the next phase will teach you how to safely explore the deeper 10% without breaking that control.

==========================================================================================================
Module 6 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles teaches you how to explore the deep 10% zone without losing rhythm or safety. This is where most men make mistakes—pushing too far, too hard, or too soon. You are not diving deeper to impress; you are testing the edges of depth while keeping the same circular control you built in Flow. For an endomorph, stability is the priority. For a penis below five inches, the deep zone isn’t about distance but density—how pressure feels thicker, warmer, and more connected when the angle is right. Deep training here sharpens sensitivity, not force.
Start from your neutral forearm plank. Breathe deeply through your nose, exhale through your mouth. Perform three shallow orbits to warm the muscles. On the fourth, lower your hips slightly by one inch while maintaining your circular motion. This small adjustment takes you into the mid 10% zone. Inhale as you move through the back arc, exhale as you push through the forward curve. Your goal is to feel the increased resistance on the inner compass walls without breaking smoothness. For the endomorph frame, engage your core strongly and keep your chest lifted slightly higher to distribute load evenly. If your lower back starts to compress, pause, reset baseline, and try again.
When the orbit holds steady at mid depth, introduce controlled hard pressure only at the northern wall—the 12 o’clock point. Think of it like pressing a thumbprint gently into wet clay. Hard pressure here is brief and conscious. The rest of the orbit should stay medium. This variation allows you to feel the difference between force and firmness. The shorter shaft can fully activate deep receptors with this timed pressure pulse even without full insertion. Watch for internal feedback cues—if she were present, this is where her breath would deepen or body still. Those are the same points your nervous system must register.
After every third deep orbit, return to shallow baseline for two breaths. This alternating pattern prevents fatigue and teaches your pelvic muscles to manage transitions between zones. The circle remains the same; only your depth and pressure change. Never let the hips drive independently of breath. Deep work without breath control overloads the joints and dulls sensitivity. The rule is simple: inhale equals lift and control, exhale equals glide and release.
Endomorphs should be especially mindful of elbow alignment. Keep them tight to the ribs. This prevents torque and protects the shoulders. Deep orbits add tension if posture breaks. Use your thighs as stabilizers, pressing gently into the ground to keep your motion circular and compact. Every deep repetition should feel like a wave that swells and recedes, not a thrust that breaks water.
To finish, perform five alternating sets: two shallow orbits, one deep orbit. Maintain full breath cycles through each. Focus on how easily your body returns to shallowness afterward. That ease is your marker of control. Deep work is successful only when recovery is instant and rhythm stays intact. End your practice in baseline, breathing slow, feeling your hips floating in the afterglow of effort.
Journal in one line: “Deep pulse@12 steady, easy return to shallow.” That entry tells you the rhythm held even under pressure. Once this consistency is locked, you’re ready for Module 7, where deep control turns into post-orgasm precision and multiplicity through micro-angle shifts.

==========================================================================================================
Module 7 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles teaches post-orgasm control—how to stay inside the rhythm when your body wants to collapse. This is where mastery separates the skilled from the untrained. The moment of climax is not an ending; it’s a test. Your task here is to use the SSP’s Observe → Tweak → Test loop to sustain motion, micro-adjust angles, and reignite flow without breaking contact. The goal is to learn how pressure, tempo, and breath combine to prolong her aftershocks and extend your control window. For an endomorph, grounding and breath pacing are your anchors. For a penis below five inches, precision of contact is your greatest weapon—reacquiring the shallow orbit and tracing the exact compass line keeps stimulation high while you recover.
Start by remaining in your forearm plank immediately after orgasm. Let your hips sink slightly but don’t drop. Inhale through your nose, exhale through your mouth. Feel your body wanting to withdraw. Resist. Instead, glide one slow orbit at Light pressure, exhaling through the curve. This first motion retrains your nervous system to stay connected through sensitivity, not tension. Observe the internal sensation: the pulse in your shaft, the warmth in your abdomen, the softness of your breath returning. These are signs your system is resetting into awareness.
Once the first orbit stabilizes, tweak one variable—angle or tempo. If you were orbiting left before climax, rotate right now. Keep pressure Light, almost teasing. The change of direction resets nerve pathways and prevents overstimulation. Breathe shallowly, focusing on smoothness. After three orbits, test a slightly firmer pass through the northern wall at Medium pressure. For the shorter anatomy, this is the perfect angle for re-entry because it maintains friction across the front ridge without deep strain. If sensation spikes too sharply, drop pressure back to Light and hold rhythm. This dance between Light and Medium is what creates multiple waves instead of collapse.
As your body calms, shift focus from physical sensation to rhythm control. Let your hips move in smaller, slower circles—half the size of the original orbit. This tight pattern reestablishes connection while keeping arousal alive. For an endomorph, this minimizes joint fatigue and keeps the movement sustainable. Breathe in for two counts, exhale for two counts, matching motion to breath. The goal is to create a smooth pulse that could, if continued, spark another rise.
During this phase, your cues of success are subtle: a deepening breath, a second pulse, a soft internal contraction. These are signs your body has learned to regulate stimulation instead of surrendering to it. Post-orgasm training teaches your system that pleasure is controllable. If the orbit starts to feel heavy or uneven, pause in neutral for one full breath and then restart gently. Each return sharpens control.
To close, perform a minute of slow orbiting at Light pressure, focusing entirely on breath and pelvic glide. End in your neutral plank baseline, spine aligned, arms steady, breathing slow. Feel how stillness now carries vibration. This is where your endurance becomes awareness.
Record your reflection in one clean line: “Post-orgasm flow held@40s, Medium pulses smooth.” That tells you the technique has converted release into sustained control. The next module will consolidate all of this into a four-week integration plan—turning training into daily mastery.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches?


==========================================================================================================
Module 8 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles brings everything together into one continuous four-week integration plan. This is where training turns into mastery. You are no longer just learning movements; you are conditioning your nervous system to hold rhythm, pressure, and awareness as one. For the endomorph frame, the plan focuses on endurance, joint safety, and consistent breath pacing. For a penis below five inches, the key is precision of wall targeting and clarity of orbit shape—every repetition should feel purposeful, not improvised. Your mission across these four weeks is to make the Egyptian Orbiting Circles an unconscious reflex: smooth, adaptive, and sustainable across all three phases—Tracking, Flow, and Pinning.
Begin each session with your neutral forearm plank baseline. Inhale deeply through the nose, exhale through the mouth, and allow your body to settle into stillness. The first week is dedicated to orientation and stability. Spend each session refining alignment—wrists under shoulders, hips neither sagging nor arched, knees wide enough to allow a clean circular path. Perform only shallow orbits for sixty seconds, resting after every ten for one breath cycle. Endomorphs should pay attention to shoulder fatigue; drop forearms to the mat during rests and shake out tension. The goal this week is postural endurance, not speed or intensity.
In week two, move into dedicated keystroke training. Each session isolates one element of the orbit: the lateral rotation, the northward press, the release back to center. Perform slow repetitions for accuracy, breathing in through each lift, exhaling through every push. Keep pressure Medium, staying within the shallow 80%. Journal after each session in shorthand like “Left orbit@15, Medium pressure steady.” The repetition builds muscle memory, and the writing captures your body data—what felt smooth, where fatigue began, which wall responded best.
Week three transitions into Flow consolidation. Start by stringing the keystrokes together into continuous orbits. Glide for two minutes without stopping, alternating direction every thirty seconds. The focus here is seamless motion—no breaks, no resets. Your breath should dictate tempo. Endomorphs must keep their core engaged and hips buoyant to avoid overloading wrists. For shorter anatomy, emphasize the head and shaft’s full contact with the southern and northern walls to maintain constant stimulation. If the orbit loses smoothness, reset to baseline, inhale deeply, and begin again. Flow isn’t forced—it’s found through relaxation and rhythm integrity.
By week four, introduce the deep 10% work. Perform short sets where you alternate between two shallow orbits and one deeper one. Maintain full breath cycles and Light-to-Medium pressure transitions. Never chase penetration depth; focus instead on feeling density and control in the motion. When fatigue or tension appears, return to shallow orbits and hold rhythm softly for recovery. Every session ends with thirty seconds of Light orbiting, just enough to bring awareness back to breath and body. This closing ritual is how you lock in control.
Across all four weeks, rest hygiene is vital. Take one day off between sessions. Endomorphs must stretch shoulders, wrists, and lower back daily. Hydrate well and use post-session breathing to discharge residual tension. The more you care for the vessel, the more refined the movement becomes. Training is not punishment—it’s calibration.
When you complete this plan, you’ll notice subtle changes. Your orbits will feel smaller but more powerful. Your breath will sync naturally with movement. Your awareness will sharpen—you’ll sense pressure shifts and timing without needing to think. What began as an exercise will have become instinct. The Egyptian Orbiting Circles will live in your body as a reflex, accessible whenever you enter a partner’s rhythm.
Record one final journal note in clean prose: “Orbit reflex steady, baseline effortless, pressure adaptive.” That marks the close of your training cycle and the beginning of mastery. You are now ready to apply the Egyptian Orbiting Circles as a fluid, enduring expression of control, sensitivity, and endurance under any condition.
Training complete.
