Module 1 for The Ngoma is about setting posture and orientation so your body can carry the stroke without injury and with clarity of contact. Start in forearm plank with your knees on the mat and your shoulders stacked directly over your elbows. Keep your wrists loose and your palms pressing lightly into the surface so the load spreads evenly down your forearms. Your spine should be in a straight line, chest broad, hips slightly tucked so the lower back doesn’t sag. For a mesomorph frame, the extra muscle bulk around the chest and shoulders can make it easy to collapse into the upper body. Counter this by lifting through the sternum as if pulling the ribcage forward while keeping the back long. This creates space for your hips to angle cleanly without compression. With a penis size of five to seven inches, depth is moderate but can still press uncomfortably if you drop your hips too low. Keep your hips one palm-width above the full drop, allowing the head to ride the shallow zone without bottoming out.
From this posture, orient your pelvis so that every keystroke begins from a steady neutral baseline. Neutral here means your shaft points at a downward diagonal toward her south-east wall with the glans pressing into shallow eighty percent depth. Inhale in the neutral, then exhale as you rock or angle into the keystroke. Reset to neutral on the next inhale. This breath pairing keeps pressure consistent and prevents your body weight from piling into your lower back or wrists. For mesomorphs, leverage comes easy, but the danger is over-driving. Keep pressure in the Light-to-Medium band until you learn exactly how each wall responds. With five to seven inches, Light pressure feels precise and sharp against her inner wall; Medium gives weight without jamming. Hard pressure should be saved for deep ten percent zones later in training.
The grounded metaphor to use here is a compass needle floating in liquid. In neutral it points southeast, calm and balanced. Each keystroke tips the needle toward another wall, but when you release, it floats right back. If your posture is set well, the return to neutral happens almost by itself, without you yanking or adjusting. This is the reflection moment where you feel whether your spine is straight, your forearms are anchored, and your hips are not dropping past the safe gate for your length. When done right, she will feel a steady presence, not random pokes. Her cues will be small—a deeper breath, a soft pelvic curl, or her hips pressing back to meet you. Watch for these without chasing them.
A sample journal entry might read: “Neutral southeast, shallow, Medium pressure, exhale steady, hips aligned.” Write it down in that simple shorthand so you know exactly what was tested. This first module is about patience, setting the rails so that every later keystroke glides true. If you cut corners here, the rhythm will never land.

Module 2 for The Ngoma will break down the active keystrokes from the stroke analysis into their exact building blocks so you can train them one by one before chaining them into rhythm. Start again from your neutral baseline in forearm plank with the shaft pointed down at the southeast diagonal in shallow depth. The first keystroke is the left hip lean. You angle your hips slightly left while keeping shoulders square, which points the glans right into her east wall. This is an Angling move, not Rocking. Work it at shallow eighty percent with Light-to-Medium pressure, exhaling as you angle in and inhaling as you return to neutral. For a mesomorph with five to seven inches, this will feel precise without strain. She will likely give a small breath shift or a stilling body cue when the east wall contact is sharp and consistent. Reset to neutral after each lean so your spine stays aligned.
The second keystroke mirrors the first but to the other side. Angle hips right so the glans presses into her west wall. Again, shoulders stay square, hips drive the direction. This is Angling as well, shallow zone, Light-to-Medium pressure, paired to exhale. Watch for cues of pelvic curl or her hips pressing back. As a mesomorph, keep leverage smooth—don’t jam past mid zone since five to seven inches can ride the west wall with clarity at shallow depth. Reset to neutral southeast diagonal after each angle so both sides are balanced.
The third keystroke is the three-part pelvic grind. From neutral, press pelvis forward so the shaft presses right wall, then shift smoothly north along the canal roof, then down to the south wall, all within shallow zone. This motion combines Rocking and Angling and should be Light pressure at first, Medium only after smooth control. Inhale during the press forward, exhale as you grind through the three walls. Reflection here is noticing if the pressure shifts are continuous like tracing a circle rather than jabbing corners. With five to seven inches you can complete all three contacts without leaving the shallow gate. Her cue will often be a deeper breath or hips pressing forward when the arc feels full.
The fourth keystroke is the vertical lift. From neutral, lift hips upward and forward so the broad top shelf of the shaft presses at her vaginal entrance, almost withdrawing but not leaving. Pause there, inhale, then exhale as you re-enter at the southeast diagonal. This is Rocking, shallow-to-mid zone, with Medium pressure at the entrance. For mesomorph build, use your chest strength to stabilize while keeping hips lifted by core engagement, not lower back arching. The effect for her is a stretch at the opening and a reset of sensation. She may sigh or release tension here. Return to neutral with full exhale before the next action.
To practice these keystrokes, begin with the left and right angles until each side feels smooth and equal. Then add the three-part grind as a separate drill, repeating slowly until you can hit each wall without skipping. Finally, train the vertical lift as a single movement with pause and return. Together, these form the skeleton of The Ngoma. Reflection journaling might read, “Left angle east wall, shallow, Light pressure, exhale steady.” That shorthand anchors your progress.

========================================================================================






Module 3 for The Ngoma is about building the full stroke out of the keystrokes you have already trained so they move from isolated drills into a single rhythm. You begin again from your neutral forearm plank with the shaft set on the southeast diagonal in shallow zone, shoulders square, spine long, and wrists aligned under elbows. The left hip angle is your opener, exhaling as you press the glans into her east wall, then returning on the inhale. From there, you mirror into the right hip angle to reach the west wall. Each side builds balance and prepares the rhythm to swing evenly without drifting posture. The key is to reset to baseline after each angle so your frame stays solid.
Once both side angles are sharp, you transition into the three-part grind. From neutral, glide the shaft across her right wall, roll it along the north ceiling, then down the south wall. This circular Rocking-and-Angling motion should feel like tracing the edges of a drum with your hips, smooth and steady. Keep it Light to Medium pressure so each wall feels distinct without overload. Inhale as you set into the grind, exhale as you complete the arc, then return to baseline. She will often respond with a stilling in her hips or a deeper breath when the arc lands evenly.
The vertical lift comes next to reset the rhythm. From neutral, press hips upward and forward so the shelf of the shaft applies pressure at her opening. Pause there with a steady inhale, then exhale as you drop back into the southeast diagonal and return to shallow entry. This lift creates contrast and resets the canal’s response before you repeat the cycle. For a mesomorph with five to seven inches, your leverage is naturally strong, so keep the pause controlled and never let the lift drift into hard withdrawal. Reflection here is to notice whether she sighs, curls her pelvis, or draws you in deeper at the entrance.
The rhythm logic of The Ngoma is built by chaining these keystrokes in sequence. Angle left, return, angle right, return, grind through the three walls, then lift and reset. Each keystroke is tied to an inhale or exhale so your breath anchors the tempo. At first, run these sequences slowly, holding neutral baseline for a full inhale between each keystroke. Over time, shorten the resets so the chain flows without visible pause, letting neural pathways link the actions into a single embodied rhythm. Your practice reflection could be written as, “Left-east wall, shallow, Medium pressure, exhale steady, reset, right-west wall, shallow, inhale return.” This shorthand helps lock the cycle.

========================================================================================




Module 4 for The Ngoma is about entering the Tracking phase, where you use the SSP loop to test shallow contact across different compass walls and refine clarity of feel. Begin in forearm plank, weight balanced through shoulders and elbows, spine long, hips steady. From this baseline, take a slow left hip angle to press the glans into her east wall at the shallow 80% zone. Inhale to prepare, exhale to angle, then return to neutral. Pause in baseline long enough to notice her cues—a deeper breath, a pelvic curl, or hips leaning into you. This is your Define step, making the movement precise enough that you can track its effect.
Mirror the same motion to the right hip angle, entering her west wall at shallow depth. For mesomorph bodies with five to seven inches, this angle feels stable and allows you to reach both walls without strain, but you must gate your pressure to Medium. If you push too hard, the shaft loses its tactile clarity against the wall. Track by watching whether she exhales or stills her body on impact. If she softens, note the angle. If not, refine on the next repetition by easing pressure down. Your journal shorthand might read, “West, shallow, Light pressure, inhale prep, still body at rep three.”
After these angles, test the grinding arc. Glide from right wall to north ceiling, then down to south wall, all in shallow zone with Light pressure. The grind combines Rocking and Angling, so it challenges your ability to feel multiple walls in one flow. Observe which wall she responds to most clearly. If her hips push in at the north wall, mark it; if her breath deepens at the south wall, adapt the next grind to dwell there a half second longer. Return to baseline after each arc to re-center. This step is your Hypothesize and Refine cycle—use observable cues to shape the next grind.
The vertical lift should be run sparingly in Tracking. From baseline, inhale to set, exhale to lift hips upward until the broad top shelf of the shaft presses against her entrance. Pause without slipping out, then drop back into southeast diagonal shallow. Track whether she sighs or curls her pelvis into you. If the entrance lift generates the clearest response, note it as a Pinning candidate for later modules. Reflection here is simple: don’t chase stimulation, chase clarity.
Across these sets, the SSP loop keeps you disciplined. Define each keystroke clearly, Hypothesize which wall or angle will spark her cues, Track her response with steady breath, then Refine the next rep. Each neutral reset is a checkpoint to prevent fatigue and to let your body memorize alignment. With mesomorph leverage, stamina protection comes from keeping resets long and pressure ceilings conservative, so you don’t burn out your joints or flood her too fast.

========================================================================================


Module 5 for The Ngoma moves from Tracking into Flow. In this stage you begin stringing keystrokes together in small, repeatable chains so the motion feels like a living rhythm rather than isolated angles. You are no longer just testing walls one by one—you are teaching your body to move across them without losing baseline clarity or her response signals.
Start in plank, weight balanced evenly across forearms and knees, spine aligned. From this neutral, take a left hip angle into her east wall at shallow 80%, exhaling through the action, then glide seamlessly into a grinding arc north-to-south. The purpose is not intensity but smoothness—the shaft should never lose wall contact. Inhale on the return to neutral. The moment she exhales or curls her pelvis in, you know the chain has landed. For mesomorph bodies, stamina is protected by letting each reset at baseline last a full breath before chaining again.
Next, pair the right hip angle into her west wall with a shallow vertical lift at the entrance. The glans traces west, then you inhale, slide upward, and exhale as the broad top shelf presses her opening. This two-keystroke chain blends Angling with Pinning. If her hips press up into you at the lift, linger a heartbeat before dropping back down into southeast diagonal. The rhythm here is Flow, not Pinning yet, so let your pressure stay Medium and allow her body to guide how long you dwell.
Flow practice for The Ngoma depends on sequencing, not power. Think of the keystrokes as musical notes: east hit, north grind, south drop, reset; west hit, entrance lift, reset. The clarity of each transition matters more than the number of repetitions. Track her breath and hips with each wall shift. If she gives you a cue on one wall, you can bias the chain there in the next cycle. Mesomorph leverage lets you glide cleanly without collapsing hips, but remember to gate depth: stay in shallow 80% with occasional mid 10% touches. Going deeper breaks Flow and overloads stamina.
Reflection at this stage is noticing how your own breath either anchors or destabilizes the chain. If you lose control, reset fully and rebuild from one keystroke. Journal notes should read like a short sentence: “East to north arc, shallow, Medium pressure, hips curled at rep six.” These entries help you see which chains sparked response and which ones fell flat.

Module 6 for The Ngoma expands Flow into controlled depth. Here the focus is learning when and how to touch the mid and deep 10% zones without collapsing rhythm, forcing pressure, or shocking her cervix. You will explore depth not as dominance but as an earned option that widens the field of stimulation when the shallow 80% has already established trust and arousal.
Begin again in neutral plank, spine long, hips balanced. Let one chain of Flow—such as east wall into north grind—build three to four shallow cycles first. When you feel her hips pressing forward or her pelvic floor pulling in, exhale and guide the glans slightly deeper into mid 10%. For a mesomorph frame, leverage is clean enough that the hips can angle without strain, but keep knees cushioned to avoid overloading joints. With a 5–7 inch length, mid-depth will usually hit her anterior wall or upper diagonal without bruising cervix. Keep pressure at Medium, exhaling through entry, then inhale as you draw back to shallow.
If she remains still and breath deepens, you can explore a full deep 10% pass. Only attempt this after several mid-depth checks. Exhale, let the hips rock—not angle—so the shaft enters straight north. Think of this like dropping an anchor into water: steady, deliberate, no slamming. Stay one beat, then inhale and retreat fully back to shallow. The contrast is what excites—deep presence followed by light gliding. For her, this can feel like expansion followed by relief. For you, the risk is stamina burn, so ration these deep passes to one every five or six shallow cycles.
Lubrication checks matter here. If glide feels tacky, reset immediately. A mesomorph with your size has enough girth to create friction quickly; never force through dryness. Instead, return to shallow Flow, grind gently along the east-west arc, and wait for her body to re-lubricate. Depth must always be permission, never assumption.
Reflection is about why you go deep: not to chase climax, but to widen her sensory field and give her nervous system new contrast points. Journal cues can be simple: “Mid hit anterior, hips pressed back, retreated after three reps.” These short notes let you see over time whether deep passes are landing or destabilizing Flow.

Module 7 for The Ngoma focuses on Pinning—using micro-control after orgasm to spark multiples or sustain a longer plateau. The work here is about discipline: holding her in place with just enough variation that her body cannot escape the aftershocks, while you remain steady and collected.
Set up from neutral plank again. Once an orgasm has crested, do not rush out. Instead, keep the glans shallow at 80%, Light-to-Medium pressure, and pin one compass wall—east or west works best for your size—by holding angle through the hips. Inhale to prepare, exhale as you hold the pin for one or two beats. Then shift the hips just a finger-width north or south, still shallow, and repeat. The sensation for her is like being held open, then teased along a nerve line without escape. The stilling of her breath or a sudden pelvic curl is the sign you are feeding the after-wave instead of letting it die.
A mesomorph body can support the stillness without shaking, but watch shoulder load—keep weight through forearms and core so wrists do not carry strain. With a 5–7 inch length, shallow pinning ensures you never jam cervix while still giving clear wall stimulation. Hard pressure here will numb her; keep it Light or Medium, only increasing briefly if her hips press directly in. One way to think of it is like keeping a bow drawn tight, releasing only micro-adjustments rather than full strokes.
Run SSP here as Observe → Tweak → Test. Observe her response to the pin, tweak the angle or pressure by a breath count, and test whether her exhale deepens or hips pull. Each loop should be short, no more than three to five breaths, before resetting neutral and beginning again. This allows you to feed multiple cycles of pleasure without exhausting your stamina or overloading her nervous system.
A simple journaling note after training might read: “West wall, shallow, Light pressure, pelvic curl on second breath.” Over time, these reflections will show which walls and pressures hold best for her body and which tend to collapse Flow.

========================================================================================


Module 8 for The Ngoma brings the full training plan together. By now you know how to hold neutral forearm-plank posture, break keystrokes into pieces, chain them into rhythm, track responses in shallow water, carry flow into mid zones, expand carefully into depth, and lock in post-orgasm pinning. This final module sets out how to train across weeks so your body, breath, and joints adapt while her body learns to expect layered orgasms.
Begin with orientation sessions twice a week. Spend these on posture, neutral resets, and shallow keystrokes only. For a mesomorph body this ensures your joints stay fresh and your stamina climbs without overload. With a 5–7 inch length, the shallow 80% remains the anchor, so these sessions focus on Light and Medium pressure along east and west walls with clean breath cycles. Inhale to prepare, exhale through action, then reset baseline. This repetition teaches your nervous system to stabilize.
Add keystroke practice three to four times a week. Choose one or two keystrokes from the Ngoma set, such as the lateral lean to the left then center, and train them in short loops. Work five to ten breath cycles per side, always returning to baseline. Journaling after each mini-set locks in memory. An example entry might read, “East wall, shallow, Medium, hips pressed in on rep three.” Over weeks you will collect a map of how her cues connect to each movement.
After two weeks, begin chaining. Run two keystrokes back to back, then rest in baseline. Gradually extend to full Ngoma sequences, grinding across north and south walls before lifting vertically. Keep the vertical lift shallow, stopping before extraction, and treat it as a punctuation point rather than a thrust. With your body type this prevents shoulder fatigue and protects stamina by using core and hips rather than arms.
In weeks three and four, add Flow sessions. Sustain shallow pressure across one wall for twenty to thirty seconds, guided by her breath. If hips press in or her body stills, hold angle longer. If cues drop away, adjust by one compass shift or a slight pressure change. Finish with a Pinning sequence—two to three short loops after her orgasm, noting in your journal which micro-angles held her body in place. These refinements become the fingerprints of your training, teaching you exactly how to pull multiples without guesswork.
The training plan closes with rest hygiene. Take at least one full day between heavy Flow sessions. Protect wrists by always pressing through forearms and spreading load into shoulders and core. Limit deep pressure to short bursts only when her body clearly invites it. If fatigue rises, drop back to orientation drills and journaling rather than forcing through.
This four-week progression leaves you with more than a stroke. It gives you a system: posture, keystrokes, rhythm, cues, reflection. The Ngoma becomes a repeatable pattern that her body will recognize, crave, and surrender to.
