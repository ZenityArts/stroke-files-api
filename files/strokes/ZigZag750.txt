Module 1 for the Zig Zag stroke is all about orienting the body into perfect alignment before any motion begins. You start in the forearm-plank position, balanced above her with your knees on the canvas and your hips suspended so your spine forms one smooth line from shoulders to tailbone. For the ectomorphic frame, this means engaging your core without collapsing into the joints—let the long levers of your arms and legs distribute load evenly so the shoulders stay light and wrists free of strain. The neutral baseline begins here: a steady hover where your pelvis can tilt or rock without your upper body shifting. You’ll inhale to prepare, feeling your chest widen and your ribs expand, then exhale to let the pelvis settle and align naturally behind the entry angle. This neutral posture keeps pressure flowing through bone rather than muscle, protecting endurance and sharpening wall sensitivity.
From this steady base, drop your hips fractionally toward the canvas until the head of your penis points slightly north. This subtle tilt creates the angle that defines the Zig Zag—an oblique alignment where the top surface of the shaft contacts her north wall instead of driving directly forward. This entry uses both Rocking and Angling in tandem. The motion begins as a controlled Rock forward on the inhale, then transforms into a Light-pressure Angling contact on the exhale. With a shaft length above seven inches, this angle is critical: you’ll feel contact along the upper two-thirds rather than the full length. Staying shallow 80 percent of the time prevents compression of her cervix and preserves stamina. Her cues will confirm accuracy—a deeper breath, hips pressing upward, or a small pelvic curl into the motion. If you notice tightening or withdrawal, ease pressure and reset the baseline before continuing.
Depth control comes next. As you exhale into each shallow entry, monitor the degree of insertion carefully. For an above-seven-inch length, the goal is clarity, not depth. Let your mind visualize three zones—shallow (80%), mid (10%), and deep (10%)—and use breath to gate them. The shallow zone is where tracking sensitivity builds; the mid zone exists for Flow once her body opens; and the deep zone should only occur as a response to her cues. When the stroke later expands, this understanding of gating will let you shift seamlessly between depths without losing control. The ectomorphic body benefits from rhythm rather than drive—think of your hips as a pendulum rather than a piston. Use your breath as the anchor: inhale through the lift, exhale through the slide.
Joint protection must stay constant throughout. The forearms bear weight, not the wrists. The shoulders stay above the elbows, never past them. The core remains active, keeping the lower back from sagging. Your hips hover just above hers, maintaining an air pocket that allows you to Rock or Angle freely. When fatigue sets in, return immediately to neutral—drop your knees, stretch your spine, and reset the forearms. Overextension is the biggest risk for an ectomorph because of long levers; avoid letting reach turn into collapse. A simple metaphor helps: imagine your body as a suspension bridge—strong through tension, not compression.
The breath anchors the entire system. Each movement must follow the rhythm of inhale, align, exhale, act. That breathing pattern prevents jerks and keeps the nervous system calm, which translates directly into smoother wall contact. Your partner feels this stability as safety; her breath deepens in response. This is how the foundation of the stroke begins—through steadiness, not force. The ectomorph’s light structure excels at sensitivity; precision and rhythm are your greatest tools. A journal note after each practice round might read, “North at thirty degrees, shallow, Light pressure, hips pressed in at rep two.” That single line captures compass, depth, pressure, and partner cue, reinforcing awareness over repetition.
By the end of this orientation module, your body should know where neutral lives, how breath supports each movement, and how to feel the first touch of her north wall without tension or collapse. Once this foundation is set, the keystrokes can be trained safely and with control. Ready to proceed to Module 2 for Zig Zag with Body Type Ectomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?

Module 2 for the Zig Zag stroke focuses on breaking down its active keystrokes so you can train each as a precise building block before combining them into full rhythm. Begin again in your forearm plank, knees grounded, spine aligned, and hips hovering. Every motion will start and end from this neutral baseline. The first keystroke is the Vertical Drop—a controlled lowering of the hips that angles the penis downward at a slight northward diagonal. It combines both Rocking and Angling: Rocking through the pelvis and Angling through the shaft’s tilt. The head and top shelf of the penis glide along the north wall in the shallow 80 percent zone with Light pressure. Inhale to lift and align, exhale through the drop. For an ectomorph with length above seven inches, limit descent to the moment the glans begins to broaden her breath. Any deeper and the cervix risks impact. Her cues of warmth and a long exhale confirm contact accuracy. When her body stills, hold that line, then reset gently.
The second keystroke is the Forward Shuttle, powered through your forearms and shoulders. From neutral, inhale to prepare, then exhale as you push forward using your triceps. Your hips follow, sliding the shaft laterally north-by-east in a broad sweep that stays shallow. The motion stimulates the north wall’s upper band with a Medium pressure wave that widens the contact path. This is primarily Angling work—it extends your reach across her inner curve rather than into her depth. The ectomorph’s lighter frame should emphasize glide over force, keeping breath continuous so the core absorbs recoil. Her response will be a pelvic curl or an upward press of the hips, showing the wall is being tracked smoothly. If her breath shortens, slow down and lighten pressure to maintain flow without friction.
The third keystroke is the Reverse Shuttle, the counterpart extraction phase. Inhale as you draw your body backward, keeping the head of your penis pressed to the same wall with the same top-shelf contact. The motion remains shallow but shifts toward mid-zone by the final third, using Light pressure tapering to release. Rocking returns here—hips trace a backward pendulum swing. This reverse movement prevents the tip from leaving her and maintains constant stimulation along the wall. The ectomorph must guard against overextension; stop before full arm lockout to preserve shoulder integrity. Her breath softens and the abdomen releases when the withdrawal stays smooth; a gasp or tightening signals too steep an angle or loss of lubrication.
The fourth keystroke is the Anchor Reset. Once you’ve drawn fully back, lift slightly through the core to relieve pressure entirely. Exhale, letting the pelvis rise an inch as you feel the shaft unweight. This keystroke realigns you to neutral, resetting your internal compass. It’s a pure Rocking motion, Light pressure, shallow depth. The reset teaches your nervous system to recognize zero load—essential for stamina. For long-shaft control, this reset protects from cumulative tension. She will feel a pause and a cooling of friction; if her body arches upward, that’s the signal that she’s ready for re-entry.
Together, these keystrokes teach you the directional logic of the Zig Zag. The drop initiates contact; the forward shuttle expands it; the reverse shuttle maintains it; the anchor reset clears it. In rhythm terms, the Drop and Forward Shuttle dominate the Tracking phase, the Reverse Shuttle refines Flow, and the Anchor Reset punctuates Pinning. To train them effectively, begin by isolating the Vertical Drop and Anchor Reset as a pair—this builds postural memory and depth discipline. Once you can feel her breath mirror yours through these two keystrokes, add the forward and reverse shuttles. The sequence will begin to feel like tracing a diagonal figure-eight against her inner wall. That pattern becomes the foundation of the complete stroke.
Depth gating remains critical for the ectomorphic body with a shaft above seven inches. Keep 80 percent of reps shallow, using mid-zone access only when lubrication and cues confirm readiness. Pressure ceilings stay at Medium to avoid overwhelming tissue. Maintain plank alignment by stacking shoulders over elbows and tightening the core to keep the hips from sagging. Your wrists should never carry weight—spread load across forearms. A journaling note after each session might read, “North-east diagonal, shallow, Medium pressure, pelvic curl at rep three.” If any uncertainty remains about lateral width, you’ll clarify it during the construction module through timed rhythm tests. I am ready to generate Modules 1–8 for Zig Zag with Body Type Ectomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches.


=======================================================================================================




Module 3 for the Zig Zag stroke focuses on chaining the individual keystrokes you’ve trained—Vertical Drop, Forward Shuttle, Reverse Shuttle, and Anchor Reset—into a single rhythmic loop that flows without conscious separation. Begin in your forearm plank, elbows under shoulders, knees lightly grazing the canvas, and spine long. On your inhale, lift slightly to the neutral baseline; on the exhale, initiate the Vertical Drop. Let your hips sink toward the canvas as your shaft angles north, gliding the head and top shelf against her upper wall. This is your ignition point—the first contact that signals her body to open. When her breath deepens or her hips tilt upward, you’re aligned. Hold a microbeat there before sliding into the Forward Shuttle, using your arms to push your body forward while maintaining the same wall contact. The motion is smooth, lateral, and shallow. You’re not driving into depth but tracing width. Inhale through the load, exhale through the slide.
At the end of the Forward Shuttle, the Reverse Shuttle begins instantly. Pull yourself backward through your arms without losing contact along the north wall. Let your pelvis Rock subtly as you retract. The movement is a mirror image of the entry but carries a soft, melting pressure instead of expansion. The ectomorph frame, with its longer lever lines, must rely on breath and shoulder tension control to keep rhythm stable. Over-extension of the arms can break the wall connection; instead, stay within your shoulder’s natural hinge and let the core drive the return. When the head reaches the shallow 80 percent zone, transition directly into the Anchor Reset—lifting the pelvis just enough to release tension, inhaling through the core as the shaft unweights. That release teaches you neutrality between strokes.
Now the chain restarts from that lifted baseline. Drop again, shuttle forward, reverse, reset. The four movements begin to merge into one continuous figure-eight that oscillates diagonally across her north wall. The rhythm breathes in fours—inhale to align, exhale through contact, inhale on withdrawal, exhale on reset. For the ectomorph, pacing is more important than range. Each repetition should feel like tracing a narrow seam of heat rather than plunging through resistance. The length above seven inches demands constant awareness of depth gating; if her breath sharpens or her thighs tense, back off pressure by half a centimeter rather than fully withdrawing. The reward for staying shallow is sensitivity—each gliding pass recruits new nerve endings on the upper ridge.
As the sequence gains fluidity, shift from conscious control into sensory tracking. Feel how the walls yield differently at the start and return. Notice the changing texture under the head as you pass from the outer to inner band. That awareness forms the core of SSP’s Track-and-Refine loop. Each cycle, define one intention—contact angle, pressure consistency, or breath synchronization—and test it for four to six reps before adjusting. When her pelvis begins to follow your rhythm naturally, you’ve achieved flow continuity. Her cues—hips pressing, chest lifting, a long exhale—show the nervous system syncing with yours.
Training this chaining demands endurance without strain. Because the ectomorph frame disperses load unevenly across long limbs, every fourth cycle should include a rest breath in plank to reset shoulder stability. Keep pressure under Medium except during the final second of the Forward Shuttle when you can increase to Hard for one exhale pulse. Then release immediately on return. Journaling after each session helps encode muscle memory: “North wall diagonal, shallow, Medium to Hard pulse at forward apex, full-body exhale, smoother follow-through at cycle five.” The Zig Zag rhythm grows out of repetition that teaches the body to draw lines of sensation instead of thrusts of force.

=======================================================================================================


Module 4 for the Zig Zag stroke centers on mastering the Tracking Phase—the shallow 80% range where clarity, control, and sensory precision are developed. You are not chasing intensity here. You are defining feedback. Begin in forearm plank, inhale to lengthen the spine, and exhale into the Vertical Drop until the head of your shaft meets the north wall at shallow depth. Pause just long enough to feel the texture of that contact. The SSP loop starts here: define one quality to track—angle consistency, wall adhesion, or breath timing. Then perform four slow repetitions to test it. Each rep, move through Vertical Drop, Forward Shuttle, Reverse Shuttle, and Anchor Reset with Medium pressure. Inhale as you lift, exhale through each forward glide. Her body will tell you when your angle is true: hips pressing upward, breath deepening, or a quiet stillness replacing motion. When those cues appear, hold your compass direction and continue tracking at that angle.
Because of the ectomorph’s long frame, stability is won through compression, not extension. Draw your ribs toward your pelvis to steady the core and reduce shoulder fatigue. This keeps the spine floating while your arms steer. Overreaching to extend the stroke will over-angle the shaft and risk losing north-wall contact. Instead, use micro Rocking in your pelvis—one-inch shifts—to maintain glide without thrust. The 80–10–10 model applies strictly here: remain in the shallow 80% to develop sensitivity. Only in the last few reps of a set can you allow a gentle deep pulse into the mid 10% zone, exhaling fully to test the wall’s give before returning immediately to shallow territory. Her breath softening or her pelvis curling down confirms she felt that controlled depth without pain. If she flinches or tightens, reset at shallow immediately and reestablish rhythm through lighter, slower passes.
Each mini-set teaches the difference between movement that stimulates and movement that overwhelms. Use the SSP loop deliberately: hypothesize what she responds to (angle, tempo, pressure), track for several reps, then refine based on cues. When her hips start matching your forward glide, it means her pelvic floor has synchronized with your timing. Maintain that sync by softening your exhale and staying within Medium pressure; resist the urge to speed up. The Zig Zag’s strength is in breadth, not drive. Think of your shaft as a brush tracing a glowing line across the top wall. Each sweep deposits warmth and tension that builds over time.
After every eight to ten cycles, lift into neutral plank and breathe. Let your forearms ground, shoulders realign under your chest, and spine return to neutral curvature. This reset prevents the ectomorph’s hyperextension and keeps joint load distributed evenly. Because of your longer limbs and above-seven-inch length, depth gating is critical. Do not exceed a point where the glans presses firmly against the cervix; stay one finger-width shy of that barrier. If her breath catches sharply or her thighs clamp, you’ve crossed it. Pull back half a centimeter, reduce pressure to Light, and re-enter only when her breath steadies. This ensures longevity of practice and trust of the body beneath you.
Journaling right after each session locks the awareness. Write one simple line in real language, not data: “North wall diagonal, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, longer exhale at rep six, hips followed the glide.” That record captures the learning in physical terms, ready for next practice. The more you train this shallow tracking, the clearer her internal geography becomes and the easier it will be to transition into Flow in the next module. Your body learns to map pleasure rather than chase climax.

=======================================================================================================




Module 5 for the Zig Zag stroke moves from the analytical Tracking phase into Flow—the moment when mechanical clarity becomes embodied rhythm. Your job now is to translate precision into movement that breathes on its own. Begin in forearm plank with the same shallow alignment you trained before. Inhale to lengthen the spine; exhale to drop the hips just enough for the glans to seat under the north wall. From here, the keystrokes you practiced—Vertical Drop, Forward Shuttle, Reverse Shuttle, and Anchor Reset—start to connect without pause. The body no longer executes them one by one; it flows through them as a single continuous loop. The key is breath pacing. Inhale during the brief lift of your pelvis, exhale through both shuttles, feeling your ribs and abdomen soften with the release. The breath becomes the metronome.
Flow teaches continuity, not intensity. For the ectomorph, this means containing range. Keep the motion compact—no more than two inches of forward travel. Because of your above-seven-inch length, it’s easy to overshoot and hit deep too soon. Protect that by keeping the angle shallow, almost parallel to the canvas. Think of your pelvis gliding laterally rather than thrusting. This reduces torque on your lumbar spine and keeps north-wall stimulation steady. Medium pressure remains the default. You can escalate to Medium-Hard for one or two reps per set only if her hips begin pressing upward, showing she’s absorbing rather than resisting. Her breaths will deepen; sometimes you’ll feel a small tremor through her thighs—that’s your cue that the wall is waking up. Hold that rhythm, do not change the angle.
Flow rhythm belongs to the 80% shallow and 10% mid-depth zones. The alternation between light and medium pressure generates what feels to her like a rolling wave, a swelling warmth that travels up the wall. When done correctly, her body will start syncing unconsciously—breath rising as yours falls. The physical cue is subtle: her navel may press upward, or her hands may tighten around your arms. That is her way of anchoring into the tempo. Your job is to stay neutral in spine and forearms, letting your pelvis do the work. Avoid stiffening the jaw or shoulders; both will leak energy from your core.
As you continue, let the SSP loop operate subconsciously: test tempo, observe her breath, refine pressure. You no longer need to stop between reps; your awareness now integrates observation into motion. When the flow is right, time stretches. The ectomorph’s long frame gives natural leverage—use it to hover the torso slightly higher, reducing shoulder fatigue and allowing freer pelvic movement. Between cycles, pull back into neutral plank, breathe deeply, and feel the forearm contact ground again. These resets keep the body honest.
The journaling reflection after Flow practice should sound alive, not mechanical: “North wall broad stroke, shallow-moderate depth, breathing synced by minute three, hips followed my glide without cue.” This note captures the lived feel, not just the mechanics. That’s how you teach your nervous system to remember.
Flow mastery sets up Pinning—the next module—where you will learn to compress that wave into a focused hold. Flow is where the Zig Zag stops being a technique and becomes music. Your compass is steady, your breath consistent, your awareness extended into her breath. Ready to proceed to Module 6 for Zig Zag with Body Type Ectomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


=======================================================================================================


Module 6 for the Zig Zag stroke introduces controlled depth—the deliberate, conscious expansion into the mid and deep ten percent zones under full awareness. Flow taught your body rhythm; now you learn restraint inside power. Begin exactly as before in forearm plank, shallow entry aligned under the north wall. Take two slow breaths to feel stability. On the third exhale, lower your hips slightly so that the glans tracks the mid-depth diagonal rather than the shallow shelf. The shift is no more than one inch. For an ectomorph with above-seven-inch length, this inch is everything—it’s the edge between arousal and impact. The goal is to lengthen the pressure wave without collapsing the rhythm.
At this stage, Rocking replaces pure Angling. Picture the pelvis as a tide sliding in and out, not a spear driving forward. The longer frame of an ectomorph can create deceptive momentum; you must slow it down by doubling your exhale. Inhale to draw slightly back to shallow, exhale to press through the mid zone. Medium pressure only. Hard pressure risks striking the cervix before she’s ready. Depth gating is your discipline here—listen for her breath catching or hips tensing; that’s your wall limit. If she exhales and curls upward, you’re clear to hover at that depth. Each cycle should last roughly six seconds: three to enter, three to return. Never hold at full length; glide, then release.
Mid-depth Flow feels different. She’ll often quiet instead of moan—the body focuses inward when the cervix begins to sense contact. Watch for stillness and warmth spreading low in her belly. That silence means she’s absorbing. Your body should stay loose in the shoulders, using the long ectomorph leverage to let your hips move like a pendulum rather than a piston. Breath control keeps your nervous system from rushing. Exhale softly through the nose on every forward glide; that sound keeps your awareness anchored. If fatigue creeps into your forearms, shift weight slightly back to your knees, rest for two breaths, then re-enter plank. Never grind through exhaustion; ectomorph joints overstretch easily.
When you graze the deep ten percent, do it only under clear invitation—hips lifting toward you, pelvis blooming open, breath exhaling fully. That’s the body’s “yes.” Glide in just until the base thickens against her outer wall; hold one breath, then retreat to mid. Deep exploration is less about penetration and more about mapping pressure. She will feel your curve tracing the back wall like a slow signature; you will feel a pulse meet you. That pulse is the deep wall saying enough. Respect it. Staying within it trains precision and trust.
The reflection after deep-zone practice should capture sensation, not ego: “Mid wall melt, breath steady, one-inch expansion safe, pulse at limit—stopped there.” That single line reminds you that control, not conquest, is mastery. For the ectomorph, sustainable stamina depends on this moderation. You are learning to let depth become subtle, not blunt—a skill that separates endurance from aggression.

=======================================================================================================


Module 7 for the Zig Zag stroke is about mastery after climax—how to stay present, how to use the body’s aftershock to spark multiple waves instead of collapsing. It’s a training in post-orgasmic intelligence. You are not chasing another peak; you are sculpting the silence that follows one. Begin again in the forearm plank, but this time, your body is slower, heavier, more electric. The goal is to stabilize that energy and redirect it through micro-movements that keep her arousal awake while you recover.
Start by returning to shallow 80 percent depth. Let your breath settle first. Inhale slowly, feel the spine lengthen; exhale down through the hips as your glans brushes her north wall lightly. The Rocking is smaller now—half an inch at most—but deliberate. The ectomorph frame must manage leverage carefully; keep the shoulders relaxed and use the hips as a hinge, not a thrust. Stay on the shallow shelf and use Light to Medium pressure. Think of tracing her inner surface like reading Braille, searching for the letters that still hum. She’ll show you with soft exhales, slight pelvic curls, or hips pressing up toward you. When you see those, hold position, add a tiny Angling shift to the left or right wall, and test. That’s Pinning—using small variations in angle or tempo to coax residual pleasure into new rhythm.
After she releases again—or even if she doesn’t—take two breaths and observe. The SSP loop here means Observe, Tweak, Test. You are no longer driving; you’re listening with your whole body. If she stills, you back off. If she reaches, you move just enough to give her direction. The ectomorph advantage is fine control; your long levers give you microscopic adjustments that feel to her like a new language. But watch your stamina—these tiny isometric holds fatigue joints fast. Every few cycles, shift slightly backward, rest the hips on your heels, then slide forward again. The return to baseline is part of the training, not a break. It keeps your nervous system regulated.
When she begins to flutter again—subtle spasms, trembling thighs—anchor the motion with breath. Inhale through the nose to prepare; exhale through the mouth as you pulse once or twice at mid-depth, no deeper. You’re testing, not taking. If she opens, glide back to shallow; if she tightens, stop completely and let her breathe. This sensitivity is the real edge of mastery. The north wall is no longer a target; it’s a mirror. What you do there reflects everything about your presence. The goal of Pinning is not control but coherence—your rhythm syncing with her recovery so both bodies merge in calm alertness.
Afterward, collapse to your knees and write the simplest line possible in your mind: “North wall whisper, shallow, Light pressure, hips alive after stillness.” That single reflection anchors what worked without mental noise. For the ectomorph with length above seven inches, the key takeaway is that less motion equals more meaning. You are learning that precision, restraint, and timing create power long after force is gone. Ready to proceed to Module 8 for Zig Zag with Body Type Ectomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?

Module 8 for the Zig Zag stroke is the integration phase—the moment you move from isolated skill to living rhythm. Over the next four weeks, your work is to refine control, precision, and emotional regulation. This is not repetition for endurance; it’s repetition for sensitivity. The goal is to make the Zig Zag feel effortless—where each lateral shift, each north-wall press, becomes part of your breathing system. Begin every session in neutral forearm plank, breathing down the spine until the body feels balanced and steady. Keep the wrists under shoulders, elbows soft, hips aligned with the line of thrust. You are building muscle memory that eliminates tension before movement even begins.
Start every training day with baseline breathing and shallow contact work. Spend the first two minutes at 80 percent depth, gliding laterally left and right across the north wall with Light pressure. This is your nervous system primer. For ectomorphs, this low-force warmup protects the joints and calibrates fine motor control before weight transfer. Every twenty cycles, reset completely to plank. This prevents fatigue buildup in the shoulders and wrists while re-centering the rhythm around breath instead of momentum. The rule is simple: if your breath starts to shorten, the nervous system is slipping into stress mode—pause and reset. Over time, you’ll notice that these resets sharpen awareness rather than break flow.
In the second phase of training, practice controlled chaining of keystrokes. Transition smoothly between the vertical drop and the lateral shuttle without losing contact on the north wall. Keep these at Medium pressure, using exhale to drive each pass and inhale to recover. For an ectomorph with a longer lever system and a penis above seven inches, always gate the depth at mid zone—no deeper than ten percent of full capacity—until rhythm is perfectly stable. Deeper penetration with long limbs can pull the spine off axis; stability must always come before expansion. If her body relaxes into you—soft exhale, hips lift slightly—then you can test a deeper angle for one or two cycles, returning immediately to shallow. The body teaches you through her feedback; this is how real calibration is earned.
In week three, shift attention to tempo control and breath matching. Use the 80–10–10 model as your compass: eighty percent shallow practice, ten percent mid-range, ten percent experimental deep if her cues permit. For stamina hygiene, ectomorphs should cap sets at sixty seconds of continuous movement followed by twenty seconds of passive rest. During rest, stay connected but still—let her body feed information through contact pressure and micro-movements. Journal short lines after each set, such as “North wall, mid-depth, Medium pressure, hips pulsing slow, exhale aligned at cycle eight.” These reflections solidify muscle memory and guide SSP refinement next session.
By week four, combine every phase—Tracking, Flow, and Pinning—into one unified rhythm. Start shallow to observe, enter mid for flow, and close with post-orgasm pinning if it occurs. Always finish by releasing to neutral baseline. This last reset is what teaches your nervous system to close loops cleanly, ensuring no joint strain, no emotional residue, only clarity. Over time, your body learns to generate this rhythm instinctively, without overthinking mechanics. That’s when you know mastery has begun—the technique dissolves, leaving only presence.
This full training arc transforms the Zig Zag from motion to message: a way of communicating through controlled lateral energy and breath-anchored attention. For ectomorphs with above-average length, the governing adaptation remains precision over power. Depth is a privilege, not a right. The real artistry lies in managing pressure and timing so that her body feels guided, never overwhelmed. You will know you’ve integrated the practice when your strokes feel quiet but her responses grow louder. I am ready to generate Modules 1–8 for Zig Zag with Body Type Ectomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches.
