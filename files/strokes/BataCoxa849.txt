Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Bata Coxa Stroke! I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to work with you—an endomorph with a penis size between 5 and 7 inches. Your body is built for endurance and raw power: a robust, full‑figured frame that provides both the stability and strength you need to execute strong, deliberate movements. Although your extension is moderate, every inch is highly sensitive, and when used with precision, you can achieve cumulative stimulation that makes every move count.
First, find a quiet, comfortable space where you can focus completely. This is your training sanctuary. Sit or lie down, relax those broad shoulders that support your heavy‑set build, and take several deep, steady breaths until your mind is clear and focused. Today, we’re going to convert your natural, powerful physique into a meticulously choreographed sequence that translates your raw energy into a rhythmic performance designed to maximize pleasure.
In our session, we’re modifying the classic missionary position to suit your endomorphic structure. You’ll start in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. This foundational stance is absolutely essential—it anchors your robust frame and ensures every movement is executed with controlled precision. Once you’re in position, you’ll insert your penis at a precisely calculated downward diagonal angle into your partner. This careful angle sets the stage for every motion that follows.
Next, initiate a smooth forward push by moving your entire body slowly northward toward your partner’s head. As you do so, the top shelf of your penis should glide gently over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Given that your extension is moderate (between 5 and 7 inches), it’s imperative that you focus the bulk of your force on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. We do this using the 80‑10‑10 principle: about 80% of your stimulation is targeted to the first 1–3 inches, while the remaining force is evenly divided—10% to the mid‑depth (around 3–5 inches) and 10% to the deep areas. This precise distribution is key to maximizing pleasure without overwhelming the delicate tissues deeper inside.
Following the forward push, the stroke transitions into the lateral phase—the hallmark of the Bata Coxa Stroke. Here, you primarily work with your left hip. Your robust endomorphic stability allows you to drop your left hip slowly and deliberately toward the canvas. As you do, the hilt (or base) of your penis applies steady pressure along the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening, while the shaft rotates so that its inner surface points to the right. This reorientation creates friction and a gentle rocking effect, massaging the right wall of her vaginal canal. Once the drop is complete, you then raise your left hip back toward the center, reversing the pressure so that the cumulative stimulation shifts smoothly—from the western section to the northern section—with your penis reorienting to point north and massaging upward from the northern wall to the eastern wall.
The stroke continues with repeated cycles of left hip drops and raises—sometimes at a consistent pace and sometimes with variations, such as a faster half-raise to intensify friction—and finishes by returning your left hip fully to center. Each repetition builds cumulative stimulation in a rhythmic “W” pattern across her vaginal canal. This introductory module is all about laying the solid foundation to transform your natural endomorphic power and moderate extension into a scientifically controlled and deeply intimate performance.
Welcome, brother—let’s start converting your raw power into an artful expression of pleasure with the Bata Coxa Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’ll break down the essential elements that form the backbone of the Bata Coxa Stroke and explain how they work together in technical terms.
The 80‑10‑10 Principle: This principle is the cornerstone of our technique. It instructs you to focus about 80% of your applied force on the shallow vaginal zone—roughly the first 1 to 3 inches—because that area is densely packed with sensitive nerve endings. The remaining 20% of your force is divided equally between the mid‑depth (approximately 3–5 inches) and deep (beyond 5 inches) zones. For the Bata Coxa Stroke, this means every forward push, lateral drop, and hip raise must be executed with the goal of maximizing stimulation in the shallow zone, while still delivering a gentle, balanced touch to the deeper tissues.
The Sexual Scientific Process: This systematic approach helps you refine your technique through the following steps:
Define Goal: Clearly identify what you want to achieve with each cycle of your stroke—for instance, maximizing friction and cumulative stimulation on specific vaginal walls.
Form Hypothesis: Based on your observations, predict which slight adjustments in your movement (such as the exact angle or pace of your hip drop) will enhance stimulation.
Track: Methodically test your stroke by performing a high number of repetitions—aiming for at least 30 strokes on each “wall”—and record your internal sensations (like the engagement of your core) along with your partner’s feedback (her breathing, subtle verbal cues, or physical adjustments).
Flow: Once you find the stroke variation that consistently produces the best results, commit to that rhythmic, automatic performance. When you’re in flow, every movement is seamlessly connected, ensuring that the 80‑10‑10 distribution is maintained throughout.
Tracking: Tracking involves gathering data from each stroke. You pay careful attention to how your partner responds and how your body feels during each cycle. This feedback informs you if your force is properly focused on the shallow zone or if adjustments are needed. Tracking transforms your performance from an art into a science, as you use that information to tweak and perfect your technique.
Flow: Flow is the state in which all your movements become second nature. After repeatedly tracking and refining your technique, you eventually reach a point where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle happens automatically. Achieving this state means your stroke is perfectly rhythmic, consistently following the 80‑10‑10 principle without conscious effort—your movements become one smooth, continuous performance.
The Tap Keystroke: The tap keystroke is a fundamental drill used to perfect your lateral control. In simple terms, it involves starting in a stable position (often a forearm plank), then shifting laterally until your hip gently “taps” the supporting surface before returning to the center. This controlled movement builds muscle memory in your lateral muscles and strengthens your pelvic floor—especially when combined with coordinated breathing and kegeling exercises. Mastering the tap keystroke is essential because it ensures that every lateral drop in the Bata Coxa Stroke is executed with precision and contributes reliably to cumulative stimulation.
Together, these elements provide the scientific and technical foundation for the Bata Coxa Stroke. They ensure that every movement you make is deliberate and optimized, with the majority of your stimulation focused exactly where it counts most. Now that you’re fully conversant with these principles, you’re ready to move on to breaking down the stroke into its fundamental components.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break the Bata Coxa Stroke down into its key components. Picture yourself in the missionary position once again—on top in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. With your robust, full‑figured endomorph build and your compact extension below 5 inches, every micro‑movement must be executed with precision to build cumulative stimulation. We’ll isolate each phase so that you gain total control over your technique.
Forward Movement: The stroke starts with you inserting your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle. From here, you gently push your entire body forward—moving north toward your partner’s head. During this forward push, the top shelf of your compact penis glides smoothly over her clitoral region, and the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This movement is foundational—it sets the stage by ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is dedicated to the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone, per the 80‑10‑10 principle. Because your extension is compact, each forward inch must be handled with exact precision so that maximum stimulation is delivered where it is needed.
Lateral Phase (Left Hip Drop): After the forward push, transition into the lateral phase by dropping your left hip toward the canvas. In this phase, the hilt (base) of your penis applies steady, focused pressure against the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening. At the same time, your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right, generating friction and a gentle rocking effect that massages her right vaginal wall in an upward motion. This lateral drop uses the tap keystroke—small, deliberate lateral movements that are executed with precision. Since your extension is compact, it is crucial to maintain the focus of force on the shallow zone, ensuring cumulative stimulation while safeguarding against excessive pressure.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Reversal): Immediately following the lateral drop, you raise your left hip back toward the center. This controlled raise shifts the cumulative pressure: the hilt of your penis now applies force from the western section toward the northern section, while your penis reorients to point north, producing an upward massage along the northern wall toward the eastern wall. This reversal integrates the stimulation from the lateral drop and maintains the rhythmic flow of the stroke.
Cycle Repetition with Variations in Pace: The stroke continues with repeated cycles of left hip drops and raises. You may vary the pace during some cycles—raising your left hip only halfway toward the center at a faster speed to intensify friction. This variation creates subtle differences in the cumulative pressure; for example, a faster half-raise may increase the frictional heat between your penis and her vaginal wall. Then, you perform another full drop to reapply the focused pressure, and finally complete the cycle by raising your left hip fully back to center, reaffirming the pressure distribution from the western to the northern sections. Once this complete sequence is achieved, the entire stroke resets and repeats continuously, forming a rhythmic “W” pattern that delivers balanced cumulative stimulation.
By deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into these distinct phases—forward push, lateral drop using the tap keystroke, controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle—you create a clear roadmap for practice. Every component must be executed with unwavering precision to ensure that approximately 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich area while the mid‑depth and deep regions receive gentle, controlled stimulation. This detailed breakdown is your blueprint for transforming raw, endomorphic power into a refined, cumulative performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each component of the Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as your breath. With your robust, full‑figured endomorphic build and a penis below 5 inches, precision is key. In this module, we’re going to focus on repetitive, focused practice of each segment—beginning with the forward push, then isolating the lateral drop via the tap keystroke, followed by controlled hip lowering, and finishing with the backward shuttle—ensuring that every repetition strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Forward Movement Drill: Start by assuming your modified plank position with your knees securely planted on a stable, supportive surface that can handle your powerful frame. Insert your penis at the precise downward diagonal angle, and then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Concentrate on the sensations: feel the top shelf of your compact penis glide gently over her clitoral region, and ensure that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is compact, it is crucial that about 80% of your force is directed to the shallow zone. Perform this forward push slowly, deliberately, and repeat it several times until you can replicate the movement with consistent, smooth precision.
Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): Next, isolate the lateral component—use the tap keystroke. From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a small, controlled lateral shift until your hip gently taps the supporting surface. Visualize how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, producing a subtle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Synchronize each lateral tap with deep, controlled breathing: inhale before initiating the move, and exhale slowly as you complete the tap. To enhance control and precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor with every lateral tap. Drill this lateral movement repeatedly—aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side—until the tap keystroke becomes naturally ingrained in your muscle memory.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: After perfecting the lateral tap, shift your focus to the lowering phase. After each lateral tap, slowly lower your dropped hip until it touches the supporting surface in a controlled manner. Concentrate on the sensation as the underbelly of your penis begins to apply cumulative, controlled pressure to her lower wall, while the upper shelf maintains steady contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle—retract your body in a controlled manner so that your penis remains in constant contact with her north wall as you reset your position without fully withdrawing. Repeat the complete sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—several times until every transition is smooth and every micro‑movement adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Throughout your drilling session, maintain deep, deliberate breathing. Every deep inhale should focus your mind and prime your body for the next micro‑movement; each controlled exhale ensures a smooth transition between phases. With consistent, focused practice, your robust endomorphic power and compact extension will merge into a series of movements executed with unwavering precision and cumulative intensity.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—that is where the true art of the Bata Coxa Stroke emerges. Return to your starting position in your modified plank—with your knees securely planted, core engaged, and your entire focus directed toward fluid integration. In this module, you’ll merge your forward push, lateral taps (using the tap keystroke), controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle into one unified, rhythmic cycle that forms the distinctive “W” pattern of the stroke.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly drive your entire body forward—moving steadily north toward your partner’s head. As you do, ensure that the top shelf of your compact penis consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward drive lays the foundation for cumulative stimulation and must strictly follow the 80‑10‑10 principle by allocating about 80% of your force to the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase. Execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip using the tap keystroke. Focus intently on how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right, generating a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Once these lateral taps are executed perfectly, gradually lower your dropped hip so that the underbelly of your penis applies steady, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf maintains continuous contact with her upper wall. Then, perform a slow, deliberate backward shuttle until you return to your starting position, ensuring that your penis remains in constant contact with her north wall throughout the retraction.
After completing one full cycle on one side, reset and mirror the entire sequence on the opposite side. Now, raise your right hip laterally and perform three deliberate lateral taps—ensuring that the right side of your penis engages the left vaginal opening while the left side produces a complementary, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall—then lower your hip in a controlled manner and shuttle backward until you return to your starting position. This alternating “walking” motion of your hips creates the rhythmic “W” pattern that defines the Bata Coxa Stroke, delivering balanced cumulative stimulation in strict accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated routine, allow your deep, rhythmic breathing to serve as your internal metronome—inhale deeply before each phase to prime your body and exhale steadily to facilitate smooth transitions between every micro‑movement. With each complete cycle, your natural mesomorphic precision and balanced extension come together in a continuous, fluid performance—a Bata Coxa Stroke that is scientifically optimized and deeply intimate.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our focus is on fine‑tuning every micro‑adjustment of your Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimum cumulative stimulation. With your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every movement must be executed with impeccable precision to adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that approximately 80% of your applied force is concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep zones.
As you cycle through your integrated routine, observe every detail of your performance. During the forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your compact penis glides consistently over her clitoral region and that the head maintains steady, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you execute the lateral taps using the tap keystroke, pay close attention to the subtle rocking motion produced by your controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even the slightest variation in your lateral angle can have a significant impact on the overall stimulation. Experiment with minor adjustments—a change of one or two degrees in your hip drop—and carefully observe how these tweaks affect the pressure distribution and rocking effect. Use your partner’s feedback—her deep, rhythmic breathing, soft verbal cues, and any subtle adjustments in her body language—as critical data points. This iterative process of setting goals, forming hypotheses, tracking feedback, and refining your technique is the essence of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout each cycle. Every deep inhale should focus your energy and prime your body for the upcoming micro‑movement, while each controlled exhale facilitates smooth, natural transitions between phases. Over time, as you continuously track your internal cues (such as core engagement and pelvic floor contractions) along with your partner’s responses, you will reach a state of flow—a seamless, automatic performance where every movement is executed with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve this state, your Bata Coxa Stroke will become an effortless, rhythmic display of scientifically optimized, cumulative stimulation.
Remember, brother, every tiny adjustment matters. Your athletic mesomorph structure and balanced extension allow you to deliver focused stimulation effectively, but every micro‑movement must be executed with consistency and precision. Through persistent tracking and meticulous refinements, your technique will evolve into a naturally flowing performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply intimate.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen designed specifically to reinforce every element of the Bata Coxa Stroke while simultaneously strengthening the core and overall stability essential for your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your detailed roadmap for transforming your natural strength and precision into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically calibrated stimulation.
Start by establishing your dedicated training space—a quiet, private area where you can focus solely on mastering your technique. Each training session should begin with an extensive warm‑up tailored to your mesomorph physiology. Engage in dynamic stretching that targets your core, hips, and lower back—these are the fundamental pillars that support every precise micro‑movement in the Bata Coxa Stroke. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, priming every muscle and joint for the detailed work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for the session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that focus on each component of the stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees firmly planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Synchronize every movement with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale as you initiate the lateral shift and exhale slowly as you complete the tap. To further enhance precision, incorporate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each lateral tap. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke becomes ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve refined the lateral tap, integrate it with the vertical movements. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps, and then a smooth, gradual backward shuttle—ensuring that every micro‑movement strictly follows the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this full integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition flows naturally. To further enhance your stability and precision, supplement your stroke-specific drills with targeted core-strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills. A strong core is critical to maintaining both balance and precise control throughout the Bata Coxa Stroke. Keep a detailed training journal where you record every session—document the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you experiment with, and your partner’s feedback. This journal is an invaluable tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, allowing you to track your progress and continuously refine your performance.
Your personalized practice routine is your blueprint to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a performance that’s fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance while troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module represents the culmination of your dedicated training, where your athletic mesomorph build and your penis between 5 and 7 inches converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your mind entirely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your penis consistently caresses her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward drive must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle—approximately 80% of your force should be focused on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone, while the remaining 20% is carefully divided to engage the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your right hip. Raise your hip in a controlled, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps. With every tap, focus intently on how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening, while the inner surface of your penis produces a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. If any lateral tap appears inconsistent—if the pressure feels uneven or the lateral angle is off—pause and isolate that movement. Drill it repeatedly until both your internal feedback and your partner’s subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while giving you the opportunity to gather precise internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, pay close attention to the contraction of your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for any subtle cues from your partner. This troubleshooting moment is essential; if you find that the cumulative stimulation isn’t as effective as it could be, make minor adjustments—such as a slight tweak in your lateral angle or a small variation in the pace of your forward push—until your technique is optimized. Use the iterative cycle of the Sexual Scientific Process: define your objective for that cycle, form a hypothesis regarding a slight modification, track the outcomes meticulously, and refine your technique until perfection is achieved.
Once you’re satisfied with your adjustments, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as a unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the cycle on the opposite side to ensure that balanced stimulation is achieved across the entire vaginal canal. Reaching a state of flow—where every movement is executed automatically, with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you achieve this state, your Bata Coxa Stroke will be a continuous, fluid expression of your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate precision—a true testament to your progression.
Celebrate your achievement, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated training into a work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your athletic mesomorph strength and moderate extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure with every move. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Bata Coxa Stroke bring you ever closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
