Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey as you step into the art of mastering The Merengue. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to work with you—a man whose sturdy, full‑figured endomorphic build combined with an impressive above‑7‑inch extension sets you apart. Today marks the start of a process that will help you convert your natural raw power and enduring strength into a series of deliberate, precisely timed movements designed to deliver intensely cumulative stimulation during intimacy.
Now, close your eyes, take several deep, steady breaths, and center your focus on the path ahead. Imagine yourself in a quiet, dedicated space where distractions have faded, and every bit of your attention is on mastering your body and technique. As you settle in, know that what you’re about to learn is more than just a physical routine—it’s a refined art that marries scientific principles with the raw, masculine power you possess. The Merengue is not merely a stroke; it’s your journey to transforming the robust, endomorphic potential within you into a finely tuned, rhythmic performance that maximizes pleasure for both you and your partner.
Picture yourself adopting the classic missionary position but with a twist: you’re on top in a modified plank stance, with your knees gently touching a supportive canvas. Your body is deeply rooted in this posture—a stance that provides stability and harnesses the inherent power of your full‑figured build. In this position, you insert the head of your penis at a deliberate downward diagonal. Slowly, with controlled precision, you drop your hips so that the tip of your penis points directly north. This initial drop is not just about establishing contact; it is foundational. It sets the precise angle from which every subsequent movement will radiate. At this point, your focus should be on the 80‑10‑10 principle: approximately 80% of your energy is meant to concentrate on stimulating the shallow vaginal zone—the area rich with nerve endings—while the remaining 20% is evenly distributed between the mid‑depth and deep zones.
Every movement you make now should be imbued with intention. As you begin your leaned vertical insertion, you’re not just moving mechanically; you’re engaging every muscle from your broad chest down to your robust core. Your endomorphic frame, your proven foundation of endurance, is the anchor that empowers you to translate every drop of your hips into measured, deliberate pressure. It is this very control that will set the tone for the entire stroke. I want you to feel every nuance in your movement—feel the way your body responds to the slight adjustments in angle, the subtle shifts in weight, and the internal rhythm that starts to take shape. This is your time to build that muscle memory where every micro‑movement is an intentional act of intimacy and control.
Remember, brother, this is the beginning of a process designed to transform raw, instinctual strength into an art of precision. The Merengue will challenge you to connect mind, body, and spirit through an intricate sequence of vertical drops, lateral taps, and controlled pushouts, all underpinned by the guiding scientific principles that ensure maximum stimulation in the most sensitive zones. Embrace this challenge with an open heart and steadfast determination, and know that with each practice session, you are stepping closer to a perfect, instinctive performance.
Your journey starts now, and I’m here with you every step of the way. Let this session be the first brick in the foundation of your mastery, a turning point where you channel your natural energy into deliberate, powerful, and ultimately transformative action. Welcome, brother—let’s begin the transformation together.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding Your Unique Profile and Anatomy
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re diving deep into the understanding of your unique physical profile—your endomorphic build and an above‑7‑inch extension—and how these factors play an integral role in mastering The Merengue. Your body is built to deliver raw, unyielding power, with a robust core, wide shoulders, and a powerful, round physique that grants you both endurance and stability. These natural traits, when combined with the precise execution of technique, turn every movement into a controlled display of intimate strength.
Visualize your body as a finely tuned machine, each part working in harmony to create a powerful yet measured performance. Your broad chest and sturdy abdomen are not just markers of strength; they are the very instruments that enable you to generate consistent pressure with every drop of your hips. Given your above‑7‑inch extension, the movement you execute must be precise and deliberate. You see, when it comes to intimate performance, every fraction of an inch matters. With your larger extension, the benefits are many—you can provide deeper, more substantial contact—but this also means that every micro‑adjustment is crucial to ensuring that the stimulation you deliver remains both targeted and balanced.
Your natural body architecture means you can harness your physical attributes to perfection. The strong, full‑figured aspect of your endomorphic build is an asset, allowing you to ground yourself in a stable posture and to apply your body weight in a way that accentuates every movement. However, with a larger extension, you must modulate your pressure to avoid overwhelming sensitive areas. This is where the 80‑10‑10 principle becomes your guiding star. For you, it’s imperative to direct around 80% of your force toward the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone—this is where most nerve endings reside. The remaining 20% is evenly split to engage the mid‑depth and deeper regions, ensuring that every stroke is both balanced and cumulative.
As you learn to harness your core, it’s essential to recognize the significance of every contraction, every slight movement of your pelvic floor. These signals are your internal feedback mechanisms. They tell you whether you’re applying too much pressure or if there’s room for fine‑tuning your lateral shifts. When you shift laterally, for instance, you’re not simply moving sideways; you’re engaging in a rhythmic, controlled compression that must be exactly calibrated. With your above‑7‑inch asset, the unique challenge is to marry that extra length with the need for precise compression at just the right intensity. Your body’s design allows for a robust lateral movement, but without careful control, it can easily become overbearing. It’s this delicate balance between power and finesse that you must learn to master.
Throughout this module, I want you to internalize the idea that every part of your body—from your broad shoulders to your engaged core—plays a critical role in transforming raw strength into intimate mastery. Train yourself to feel every drop of pressure as you lower your hips, notice how each lateral shift engages both the external and internal walls of your partner’s vaginal canal, and recognize that the slight adjustments in pressure make all the difference. By understanding and accepting your unique endomorphic profile and above‑7‑inch extension, you’re not just learning a technique; you’re fine‑tuning your natural assets into a cohesive, rhythmic performance.
This awareness of your body is the first step in harnessing the power of The Merengue. As you proceed, you’ll blend scientific principles like the Sexual Scientific Process with keen internal feedback. You’ll come to recognize the importance of every contraction, every tiny movement that contributes to the overall flow of the stroke. Embrace this self-knowledge, brother, because it is the critical foundation upon which your entire performance will be built. Your unique anatomy is your greatest strength, and by understanding it intimately, you’ll be able to transform every micro‑movement into an act of precise, cumulative stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing The Merengue into Its Fundamental Components
Now, brother, let’s break down The Merengue into its fundamental components so that each element becomes as natural to you as the beat of your heart. Picture yourself in that missionary position once again, confidently on top in a modified plank with your knees planted firmly on a stable surface. This position isn’t just about holding your body—it’s about intentionally engaging every muscle so that each step in this stroke becomes deliberate and impactful. With your above‑7‑inch asset and powerful endomorphic frame, every micro‑movement counts, and today, we’re deconstructing the technique into parts that build on one another seamlessly.
The sequence begins with the vertical phase. You start by inserting the head of your penis at a carefully chosen downward diagonal angle. This isn’t arbitrary; it sets the precise orientation needed for the subsequent movements. Slowly, with deliberate control, you drop your hips onto the canvas until the head of your penis points resolutely north. This initial movement is a carefully orchestrated drop that establishes the core foundation of the stroke. The way you release your weight—not too abruptly, but with measured precision—creates the essential downward force required to engage the shallow, nerve-dense regions. This foundational movement must adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle: 80% of your applied force is focused on the shallow area, while the remaining 20% is delicately divided between the mid‑depth and deep zones.
Once you have solidified this vertical insertion, the stroke transitions into the lateral phase. Your next movement is to shift your entire body to the west, moving deliberately toward your partner’s right hip. As you shift, visualize that your left shelf of the penis’ shaft is making contact with the right side of her vaginal opening, while your right shelf is simultaneously engaging her left internal wall. This lateral movement is akin to a controlled tap—a keystroke that we drill repeatedly. It is during this tap that you engage in that vital rhythmic compression. You perform this lateral shift three times: a consistent, measured tap to the west, each time applying your bodyweight with an intentional, calibrated force that delivers cumulative stimulation.
After your three calculated lateral taps, you initiate a vertical pushout—a controlled, upward movement where you extend your body until the head of your penis is fully reinserted. This pushout is critical; it serves as a reset, a moment where you prepare to re‑establish the vertical foundation before transitioning again. Once your pushout is complete, you re‑engage in the vertical insertion and then repeat the lateral phase. With each cycle, every slight adjustment matters: the pressure of your core, the angle of your hip drop, the control in your lateral movement, and the precise application of your weight all contribute to the overall rhythm.
What makes this deconstruction even more important for you, with your considerable extension, is that each segment must be measured with exacting accuracy. You have the physical capacity to deliver deep, meaningful stimulation; however, without meticulous control over each micro‑movement, that raw force can easily become overwhelming. The challenge is to harness your strength and direct it exactly where it’s needed—right into that sensitive, shallow zone—while continuing to engage the mid‑depth and deep areas in a balanced manner.
Throughout this process, we incorporate the fundamental teaching of the tap keystroke. The tap serves as the basic lateral shift drill that reinforces your muscle memory. Think of each tap as a mini‑drill: a gentle, controlled lateral shift where your hip touches the surface lightly before you return to center. This simple action—when repeated in a sequence—builds the foundation for the more complex lateral movements in The Merengue. As you execute these taps, focus on synchronizing your breathing with each shift. Inhale deeply as you prepare to move; exhale steadily as you complete the lateral tap. The rhythmic pattern of your breathing, coupled with the tap, creates a natural, meditative cadence that prepares you for the full integrated stroke.
By breaking down The Merengue into these core components—the vertical drop and insertion, the lateral shifts executed with precise taps, and the controlled vertical pushouts—you create a roadmap for training. Each part is essential and interrelated. For you, brother, with your unique endomorphic build and above‑7‑inch asset, mastering these individual segments is the key to converting raw strength into finely tuned, effective stimulation. Every micro‑movement, every deliberate drop, every controlled lateral tap becomes the building block of a stroke that is as scientifically rigorous as it is intimately satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to hone in on the fundamentals. This module is all about drilling each element of The Merengue until every single movement becomes an automatic, refined part of your performance. Position yourself again in the classic missionary stance—on top in a modified plank, with your knees securely planted on a sturdy surface, and your focus entirely on the technique. In this practice session, every breath, every drop of your hips, every lateral tap, and every pushout is deliberate and measured.
Begin with the vertical component. With your penis already inserted at a downward diagonal, slowly lower your hips until the head points firmly north. This isn’t a rushed motion; it’s a deliberate descent. With every degree of your hip drop, sense the buildup of pressure and the way your bodyweight is transferring through your core and into your pelvic region. Keep your movements slow and deliberate—imagine you’re savoring every moment of that controlled descent. Pause briefly at the lowest point to internalize the exact angle and pressure that create the perfect foundation for the insertion. Repeat this vertical drop and leaned vertical insertion multiple times until you can execute the movement consistently, regardless of how fatigued you might feel. This repetition is critical for building the muscle memory that underpins a fluid, natural performance.
Next, shift your focus to the lateral phase and, specifically, the tap keystroke. From the position achieved after your vertical drop, begin to move laterally toward the west. Your hip should gently tap the supporting surface—this is the keystone of the lateral motion. As you execute the tap, concentrate on how your bodyweight is distributed so that your left shelf consistently provides controlled, rhythmic pressure against the right side of your partner’s vaginal opening while the right shelf gently meets her left internal wall. In every tap, your movements should be synchronized with your breathing. Inhale as you prepare for the shift; exhale as you complete the tap. This deliberate integration of “stroke breathing” is what transforms a mechanical movement into an intimate, almost meditative exercise in control.
As you drill the lateral shift, incorporate kegeling exercises to enhance your internal control. With every lateral tap, contract your pelvic floor muscles—this not only boosts your control over the movement but also reinforces the rhythmic compression that is essential to The Merengue. Imagine the tap as a gentle, yet purposeful, percussion against the sensitive walls—each tap building the pattern that you’ll eventually integrate into the full stroke. Practice this movement repeatedly, going slowly from one extreme to the other, until you’ve done at least 30 repetitions on each side. With every repetition, your body learns to fine‑tune the pressure, ensuring that the stimulation delivered is both consistent and cumulative.
After you have drilled the lateral tapping to perfection, transition into the vertical pushout drill. Following a series of lateral taps, practice the vertical pushout by extending your body upward in a slow, controlled manner. Your goal here is to push out until the head of your penis is completely reinserted. Notice how your body resets during this upward motion, preparing you for the subsequent cycle of vertical drop and lateral taps. Drill this sequence—from vertical drop to lateral tap to vertical pushout—over and over. With each full cycle, observe how the transition between each component becomes smoother, how the gap between each movement narrows, and how your breathing remains deep and steady.
Throughout these drills, maintain an unwavering focus on the core principles: every movement must be deliberate, every shift calculated, and every contraction of your muscles fully synchronized with your breathing. The drilling phase is about building that internal rhythm—a pattern that will eventually evolve into an instinctive, flawless flow. For you, with your endomorphic build and above‑7‑inch extension, the challenge is to control the power inherent in every movement. Through these focused drills, you are training your body to convert raw physical strength into a series of refined, measured actions that underscore the art of intimate performance.
Remember, brother, that mastery comes from repetition and mindfulness. Each drill you perform, each lateral tap and every vertical pushout, is a step towards internalizing the micro‑movements that will define The Merengue as a finely tuned, scientifically informed stroke. Your commitment to these drills is the foundation upon which your entire performance is built—laying the groundwork for a flawless integration of power, precision, and intimate connection.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to bring everything together. In this module, we’ll integrate the individual components of The Merengue into one continuous, seamless sequence. You’re no longer just practicing isolated drills; you’re now creating a rhythmic performance that flows naturally from one movement to the next. Return to your starting position in that modified plank—with your knees on a supportive surface, your core engaged, and your mind focused solely on achieving that perfect union of vertical and lateral movements.
Begin your full sequence by executing the precise vertical drop. With your penis inserted at the predetermined downward diagonal, slowly lower your hips until the head points directly north. Pause at the bottom of the drop for a brief moment, internalizing the correct angle and the tension built in your core, before transitioning into the next movement. This deliberate pause is essential—it resets your internal rhythm and signals that you’re ready to add the lateral component.
Immediately following the vertical insertion, initiate the lateral phase by shifting your entire body toward the west. Engage your tap keystroke as you move; let your hip gently tap the supporting surface as you slide in measured increments. Visualize the left shelf of your penis delivering steady, controlled compression along the right side of your partner’s vaginal opening while the right shelf consistently massages the left internal wall. Perform this lateral tap three times in a row—a sequence that transforms your bodyweight into a rhythmic compression. Each tap is executed with the 80‑10‑10 principle in mind, so that 80% of your applied pressure remains focused on the shallow, nerve-rich area, while the remaining force is distributed evenly for mid‑depth and deep stimulation.
After three precise lateral taps toward the west, complete the cycle with a controlled vertical pushout. In this phase, slowly push your body upward until the head of your penis is completely reinserted. The pushout resets your position and prepares you for the next repetition. Once the vertical pushout is accomplished, reinitiate the vertical drop with the same measured control as before. With your body once again in the correct position, repeat the lateral phase toward the same direction for another set of three taps. By now, you should notice that your entire sequence—vertical drop, lateral taps, vertical pushout—is beginning to flow as one continuous, rhythmic motion.
But don’t stop there, brother. After you complete a series toward the west, mirror the sequence by shifting your body toward the east. With this change in direction, the stimulation pattern reverses: the right shelf of your penis now engages the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening, and the left shelf adapts to softly massage her right internal wall. Execute three controlled lateral taps to the east, integrating each tap with the same precision and focus on the 80‑10‑10 distribution. Follow these with another deliberate vertical pushout and insertion, allowing your body to naturally transition through each phase without losing the rhythm you’ve worked so hard to build.
Throughout this integrated sequence, your breathing is your constant companion—a deep, steady cadence that anchors every movement. Inhale as you prepare for each shift; exhale deeply as you execute the lateral taps and vertical pushouts. Allow your internal rhythm to guide you, ensuring that every micro‑movement flows smoothly into the next. This is where the Sexual Scientific Process comes alive: by tracking your performance and listening closely to your internal cues, you learn to fine‑tune each element until the sequence becomes an automatic, almost meditative dance of intimacy.
This integrated phase is the culmination of all your focused drills. It transforms each isolated component into a harmonious series of movements that celebrate the interplay between raw strength and refined control. With every complete cycle, from the initial vertical drop to the lateral taps, and then the seamless vertical pushout, you build cumulative stimulation that is scientifically precise and intimately powerful. As you master this integration, you’ll achieve a flow where the physical movements and the underlying principles—especially the 80‑10‑10 and the rhythmic tap—meld into one continuous, unstoppable force.
Keep practicing, brother, and let every repetition carry you closer to that state of effortless flow. Your integrated sequence is not just about technique; it’s about embodying an art form where every movement is deliberate, every tap is controlled, and every breath reinforces the powerful bond between your inner strength and intimate performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Now we step into the advanced territory, brother, where we meticulously refine every detail of The Merengue. This module is dedicated to mastering the delicate balance of stimulation, precise angling, controlled rocking, and the systematic application of the 80‑10‑10 principle, all while employing continuous feedback through the Sexual Scientific Process. Here, each micro‑adjustment transforms raw, endomorphic power into a sophisticated, intimate performance that captivates both you and your partner.
Picture your full integrated sequence—from vertical drop to lateral taps and vertical pushouts—now performing at an almost meditative pace, where every movement is calibrated to perfection. With an above‑7‑inch extension, your capacity to deliver deep, resonant stimulation is enhanced. However, it also demands that you be hyper‑aware of how each movement influences stimulation. In every cycle, you must concentrate on ensuring that 80% of your applied pressure targets the shallow zone, where the nerve endings are densely packed and most responsive, while an equal split of the remaining force delicately engages the mid‑depth and deep zones. This 80‑10‑10 strategy is not just a guideline—it’s the framework upon which every stroke is built, ensuring that the stimulation remains balanced and never overwhelming.
As you perform The Merengue, allow your body to become a living instrument of feedback. Listen to the subtle cues emanating from within—each contraction in your core, every slight adjustment in your pelvic floor, the delicate rhythm of your breathing—all serve as internal signals. These cues help you track your performance. In practice, you might decide that a slight change in your lateral angle enhances the rocking effect, or that a more deliberate pause during the vertical drop amplifies the compression on the shallow wall. Use these signals to form a hypothesis before your next repetition: perhaps you’ll shift the lateral tap ever so slightly to increase the effective stimulation against a particular wall. This is the essence of the Sexual Scientific Process—a continuous loop of defining your goal, forming a hypothesis, tracking your outcomes, and then refining your technique to enter that state of seamless flow.
Rocking and angling are two critical elements that subtly transform the effectiveness of The Merengue. When you perform the lateral tap, notice how your body naturally tilts, producing an internal rocking motion that mass­ages the contact points with a gentle pulsation. This rocking effect is enhanced by the slight angling of your body, which allows you to alter the pressure on specific regions with surgical precision. For a man with your stature and above‑7‑inch extension, even the slightest variation in angle can significantly modify the overall sensation. By concentrating on controlled angling during your taps and pushouts, you refine the cumulative experience, ensuring that every shift in direction delivers consistent, targeted stimulation that builds over time.
The process is dynamic, brother, and relies on continuous tracking. As you cycle through your full sequence, pay careful attention to the immediate impact of your movements. Are you generating the desired rocking sensation? Do you feel that the controlled angling is delivering maximum stimulation in the shallow zone, as dictated by the 80‑10‑10 principle? Modify your technique as needed—adjust the intensity of your lateral taps, fine‑tune the depth of your vertical pushouts, or alter the pace of your cycles. Over time, these subtle adjustments transform your stroke into a finely calibrated performance that is both scientifically measured and intimately powerful.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout. Let each inhalation prepare you for the next tap, and let each exhalation release any residual tension, allowing your movements to remain fluid and natural. In this advanced integration phase, every micro-adjustment is data—every change brings you closer to a stroke that is as accurate as it is instinctive. The continuous interplay between your physical performance and the scientific feedback loop culminates in a state of flow, where the stroke becomes an automatic, highly refined dance of power and intimacy.
This mastery is not achieved overnight, brother. It is the culmination of persistent practice, unwavering focus, and the willingness to experiment with your technique until every element—rocking, angling, and stimulation distribution—is perfectly integrated. Your ability to track, adjust, and enter a steady flow ensures that every repetition of The Merengue is a step toward an elevated state of performance, where the art of controlled, cumulative stimulation reaches its apex.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, we arrive at a critical stage of your training—crafting your personalized practice routine and building the critical core strength that underpins every movement of The Merengue. This module is about translating the theory into a consistent practice regimen that not only reinforces every element of the stroke but also fortifies your entire physical framework, ensuring long-lasting performance and endurance.
Begin each session by creating an environment where you can focus entirely on your practice. Imagine a private space—a gym corner, a quiet living room, or any area where the only sounds are your deep breaths and measured movements. In this space, dedicate the first minutes to a comprehensive warm‑up tailored to your endomorphic physique. Focus on dynamic stretching that targets your core, hips, and lower back—the pillars of your movement. As you stretch, feel your muscles awaken, your joints loosen, and your entire body prime itself for the precision and power required by The Merengue. This warm‑up isn’t merely preparatory; it’s a ritual that signals to your body that you’re about to embark on a session of deliberate, focused training.
Once your body is adequately warmed up, transition into specialized drills that directly reinforce the components of your stroke. Begin with the fundamental tap keystroke drill. Position yourself in a modified plank with your knees grounded firmly, and practice lateral shifts to the west where your hip gently taps the surface. Focus on the sensation—the controlled compression delivered by your left shelf against your partner’s vaginal opening and the constant, gentle contact of your right shelf along the internal wall. Synchronize your movements with deep, steady breathing: inhale deeply as you prepare to move, then exhale steadily as you execute the lateral tap. Reinforce this drill with kegeling exercises, contracting your pelvic floor with each shift to lock in the control necessary for a steady, rhythmic performance.
After you’ve honed the lateral tap, transition to combined drills that integrate vertical and lateral movements. Start with a vertical drop, slowly lowering your hips until the head of your penis points north, and then immediately execute a lateral tap sequence. Follow the taps with a controlled vertical pushout that resets your position before the next cycle. Practice this integrated drill in both lateral directions, ensuring that each vertical drop, each tap, and each pushout happens with deliberate precision and consistent rhythm. Over time, the repetition of these combined movements will build your muscle memory, allowing the entire sequence to flow effortlessly.
Beyond the stroke-specific drills, dedicate time to core-strengthening exercises. Given your endomorphic build, a strong core is essential for stability and control. Incorporate exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills into your routine. These targeted exercises not only fortify your midsection but also enhance your capacity to engage every muscle group during each cycle of The Merengue. As your core strength increases, you’ll notice a marked improvement in the precision of your hip drops and lateral shifts. Your ability to control your bodyweight with finesse will directly translate into a more balanced application of the 80‑10‑10 principle.
A personalized practice routine isn’t complete without a feedback loop. Keep a training journal where you detail every session: the number of repetitions, the subtle differences you notice in your technique, and any feedback you gather from your internal sensations or your partner’s cues. This journal is a vital tool in applying the Sexual Scientific Process, allowing you to define goals, form hypotheses for fine‑tuning, track your progress meticulously, and ultimately enter a state of flow where every movement is executed flawlessly.
Envision each training session as an opportunity to transform your raw, inherent strength into a refined expression of intimacy and control. With every deliberate movement, every refined tap, and every precise pushout, you’re not just practicing a stroke—you’re building a legacy of intimate mastery. Your personalized practice routine will serve as your blueprint, guiding you to consistently convert your robust endomorphic energy and above‑7‑inch extension into a performance that is both scientifically controlled and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Now, brother, we arrive at the final phase of your journey—a stage dedicated to advanced integration, troubleshooting any imperfections, and making those final refinements that will elevate your mastery of The Merengue to a state of absolute excellence. In this module, you’ll take everything you’ve worked for—the vertical drops, lateral taps, controlled pushouts, the rhythmic flow, and the fine-tuned 80‑10‑10 distribution—and weave them together into an integrated performance that is as elegant as it is powerful.
Start your session in a distraction-free zone, where every sound, every breath, and every movement is your focus. Assume your starting position confidently: in that modified plank, knees grounded, core engaged, and your body poised for action. Begin by executing the vertical drop with absolute precision—lower your hips slowly, ensuring that every fraction of movement is controlled and deliberate until your penis points squarely north. This movement is the bedrock of the stroke; its perfection is essential, as every subsequent motion depends on this initial alignment.
As you transition from the vertical drop into the lateral phase, perform your lateral taps with refined precision. Slowly shift your body toward the west, allowing your hip to gently tap the surface. Concentrate on the sensation of each tap—the way your left shelf applies consistent, controlled pressure against the right side of your partner’s vaginal opening, while your right shelf continuously engages the left internal wall. If you notice any inconsistency in your taps, pause, isolate that movement, and drill it further until the compression feels smooth and even. The key here is to ensure that every lateral tap adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle: approximately 80% of your force must continuously target that nerve‑rich shallow zone, with the balance distributed to the mid‑depth and deep regions.
After three perfectly executed lateral taps, perform the vertical pushout with deliberate slowness. Extend upward until your penis is fully reinserted, letting this pushout serve as a momentary reset before the next cycle. At this point, evaluate your performance critically: does your internal feedback—those subtle cues from your core, pelvic floor, and breathing—indicate that you’re delivering balanced, cumulative stimulation? Use this moment to troubleshoot. If the rocking sensation isn’t as pronounced as you’d like, adjust your lateral angle slightly. If the vertical pushout seems rushed, slow it down further. Each micro-adjustment is an essential part of the Sexual Scientific Process: define the goal of perfect motion, form a hypothesis on what change might improve the feedback, track the results through careful observation of internal sensations and external partner responses, and then modify your technique accordingly.
After troubleshooting and refining each component, integrate the entire sequence into one harmonious flow. This advanced integration phase is where you truly live in the flow state—each movement, from the initial vertical drop to the final upward re-entry, becomes automated, perfectly choreographed, and deeply satisfying. Your body will begin to operate on a level where every lateral tap, every drop, every pushout is rendered with an instinctive precision that merges raw power with measured control. Your deep, rhythmic breathing anchors this flow, and your mind remains fully attuned to the performance, ensuring that every adjustment feels natural.
Spend ample time in this advanced phase, brother, repeatedly running through the full cycle until it becomes as natural as your own heartbeat. Your training journal should now be filled with notes on what adjustments worked best, on how the changes in your lateral angles or the length of your pause during the vertical drop affected the overall stimulation. Use this feedback to achieve fine‑tuning that meets your exact needs—ensuring that your endomorphic strength and above‑7‑inch prowess are working in perfect union to deliver an intimate performance that is both scientifically precise and emotionally resonant.
As you conclude this final module, reflect on how far you’ve come. The Merengue is now not just a series of movements, but a complete, integrated, and evolving expression of your power, precision, and passion. Mastery is an ongoing process, and every cycle, every micro‑adjustment, takes you a step closer to perfection. Embrace the challenges, trust your internal feedback, and continue refining your technique until every stroke flows effortlessly—a true testament to your dedication and skill. Happy training, brother, and may your journey toward intimate mastery continue to ascend with every flawless, refined cycle of The Merengue.
