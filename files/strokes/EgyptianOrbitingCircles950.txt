Module 1 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles focuses on orienting your body and mind before motion ever begins. The goal is to teach your frame how to hold strength without tension so every later rotation and lift can be performed cleanly. Begin in the forearm-plank position with your knees resting softly on the mat and your toes uncurled, giving a stable base. Your elbows should be directly under your shoulders and your spine long from crown to tailbone. Imagine a single straight line of energy running through your body. Take a deep inhale to feel your abdomen expand and a slow exhale to draw your navel gently toward your spine. This breath anchor creates light tension through your core without stiffening your lower back. Your hips hover just above her pelvis so that your weight is supported by your core, not by pressing into her. This is the neutral baseline—where every orbit begins and ends.
In this baseline, your body must balance between relaxation and readiness. The Mesomorph body type brings strong, compact muscle tone that gives powerful leverage, but that power can overburden the wrists and shoulders if misaligned. Keep your shoulders away from your ears, your neck long, and your chest open. Let your forearms bear even weight so your wrists stay neutral and pain-free. Engage your glutes slightly to stabilize your hips, but never clench. The spine should float, steady and neutral. The penis enters at a shallow 80% depth from this position, with the head angled downward toward her south wall. The initial contact should feel exploratory rather than forceful. Light pressure allows both partners to find each other’s natural rhythm before deeper or rotational movements begin. Inhale before any shift and exhale through it, allowing your breath to guide timing instead of muscle strength.
As you hold this posture, your awareness becomes your main instrument. Notice how your lower abdomen firms to support the pelvis. Observe how a small forward Rocking movement shifts pressure inside her without needing deeper thrusts. The neutral baseline is where you test the walls of sensation—light sweeps along her inner south wall tell you how responsive she is and how well your angle aligns. Her cues may appear as a quiet breath, a subtle tilt of her hips, or a deeper exhale. When you see or feel these signals, maintain pressure for one breath rather than chasing more depth. This trains sensitivity and patience, two core skills for this stroke.
Depth gating is vital for a man with a shaft above seven inches. Even at shallow insertion, the head already brushes the inner walls fully. Limit your deepest reach to brief moments inside the mid 10% zone. Never push into the deep 10% until modules later define it under control. The purpose now is to master positional awareness—feeling how her walls shape around you rather than testing how far you can go. Think of this orientation phase as learning to balance a compass needle; when aligned, the body feels weightless, the movement effortless.
When fatigue creeps in, drop gently to your knees without breaking the line of your spine. Let your breath return to steady rhythm, then lift back into plank. This simple reset preserves joint health and stamina. For Mesomorphs, one key to longevity is conserving energy through alignment rather than muscular force. Each second you hold baseline correctly is an investment in endurance later. The stronger your awareness here, the cleaner your orbits will feel when rotation begins.
A brief reflection after practice helps record progress. Write one line in your journal such as, “Baseline steady, shallow 80%, Light pressure, hips aligned, her breath deepened by minute two.” This shorthand keeps feedback simple and measurable.
When you can hold the forearm-plank baseline comfortably for several minutes while maintaining breath, contact, and awareness, you are ready to begin isolating the keystrokes that build the Egyptian Orbiting Circles stroke itself.

===========================================================================
Module 2 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles breaks the motion into its keystroke building blocks. Each keystroke teaches a specific mechanical skill—rotation, lift, or release—that you will later combine into continuous orbits. Begin in the same neutral forearm-plank baseline, knees on the mat, spine long, and hips hovering over her pelvis. The first keystroke is the left rotation. From baseline, draw your left hip slightly forward and inward, letting the head of your penis trace a path from her left wall toward her south wall. The movement is both Rocking and Angling, led by your core rather than your legs. Stay shallow in the 80% depth zone with Light-to-Medium pressure. Inhale to stabilize, exhale through the rotation. The Mesomorph’s compact frame allows solid leverage but can cause over-torque if the motion comes from the shoulders. Keep your upper body quiet and rotate from the lower abdomen only. She will likely respond with a small exhale or pelvic tilt as she feels the wall massage. If her body stiffens, reduce angle or lighten pressure until her breath steadies again.
The second keystroke, the north lift, begins immediately after the left rotation ends. Keeping your core firm, engage the glutes and slightly tilt the pelvis upward, sliding your shaft northward until the head brushes her upper wall at mid-depth, about the 10% zone. This movement is Angling rather than Rocking—the pelvis shifts forward and up, not side to side. Pressure rises to Medium. Inhale to prepare, exhale through the lift. The Mesomorph’s strength makes it easy to overpower this motion; the key is subtlety. You are searching for her upward response—a curl of her hips or deepened breath. When it appears, pause at the peak of pressure, holding steady for one breath before the next motion.
The third keystroke is the crush-release, the reset that restores the body to baseline. From the lifted position, soften your abdomen, release your glutes, and let your hips drop gently back to center. This is pure Rocking, a downward and slightly backward motion that relieves tension from the north wall. Pressure drops from Medium to Light as you inhale, allowing both bodies to relax. The Mesomorph’s natural stability can make this drop abrupt if not controlled—keep the descent slow and let the weight of your pelvis guide the return. She will feel this as a cooling, melting moment. Watch for her breath slowing or her hips flattening as signs that she is syncing into the rhythm.
The fourth keystroke mirrors the first on the opposite side—a right rotation. From baseline, shift the right hip forward and inward, tracing the shaft from her right wall to her south wall in the shallow 80%. This again blends Rocking and Angling. Keep pressure Light-to-Medium, exhaling through the arc. With a penis above seven inches, avoid driving too far south; the head will already reach the wall easily. Let your motion be guided by her feedback, not your range. If her hips rise or her breath grows heavier, that’s confirmation of good contact. If she retreats or tightens, shorten the angle.
The fifth keystroke repeats the north lift on this right side, gliding the head up along her inner curve to the north wall at mid-depth. This mirrors the previous lift in movement and sensation. Pressure returns to Medium, breath to the same inhale-prepare, exhale-press pattern. The Mesomorph’s strong glutes must stay disciplined; only a small upward tilt is needed to create the full sensation for her. Overextension risks losing rhythm and clarity. She will likely meet this motion with a subtle curl or pause in her breathing, showing the stroke has reached her attention zone.
The final keystroke is the returning crush-release, lowering your hips from the north angle back to the neutral center. Inhale through the drop, Light pressure, full reset. This completes one complete orbit cycle. The pattern of left rotation, north lift, release, right rotation, north lift, release forms the mechanical spine of the stroke. The rhythm alternates Rocking and Angling, shallow and mid-depth, Light and Medium pressure, always returning to the neutral baseline for alignment and breath synchronization.
To train these keystrokes, focus first on the left rotation, north lift, and release sequence until each feels smooth. Once the left side flows, train the right side. Only when both halves are balanced should you start linking them. The Mesomorph body thrives on short, deliberate sets—three to four rotations per side before resetting. This pacing preserves joints and builds endurance without strain. Keep all movements large enough to feel but never forced. Each rotation and lift teaches you to read her body like a compass, learning where pressure wakes sensation and where stillness restores calm.
Record each session with a simple journal line such as, “Left orbit stable, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, her breath deepened on exhale, right side tighter—lightened pressure next cycle.” This shorthand becomes your map for refinement.
When the keystrokes feel distinct, repeat them as continuous cycles to begin forming the orbit rhythm that defines this stroke. Mastery here depends not on speed but on consistency—each keystroke must land true before you blend them.

===========================================================================
Module 3 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles teaches how to weave the keystrokes into one flowing rhythm. You are no longer learning pieces; you are building a loop of motion that never loses alignment, breath, or awareness. Begin in the same neutral forearm-plank baseline, with your hips hovering lightly above her pelvis and your core firm but not rigid. Take one full inhale and exhale before beginning—this resets your body and mind to the rhythm of breath that will carry you through every orbit. The left rotation begins first, the pelvis drawing a controlled clockwise arc as your shaft sweeps from her left wall to her south wall. The movement is steady, a blend of Rocking and Angling, with the depth shallow at 80% and pressure held at Light-to-Medium. You exhale through the rotation, feeling her wall glide beneath you. The moment her hips press back or her breath catches, use that as your timing marker to rise.
From that cue, transition into the north lift. Engage your glutes and abs to tilt the pelvis forward and slightly upward, sliding along her inner wall toward the north at mid-depth, no deeper than the 10% zone. Pressure rises to Medium as the motion converts to pure Angling. You inhale to prepare and exhale to lift, maintaining stillness in your upper body. For a Mesomorph, strength must stay disciplined—let leverage come from the core rather than from your arms or shoulders. This controlled rise creates the crest of your orbit, the peak of pressure before the release. She will likely respond with a subtle pelvic curl or a long exhale through parted lips.
When that cue appears, soften immediately into the crush-release. The hips drop gently back to center, tracing the same path downward but slower, pressure melting from Medium to Light. You inhale on the descent, feeling both bodies relax back into the shared baseline. Her response may be a full exhale or a quiet sigh, signaling that tension has turned into surrender. This is your midpoint—a single breath where you reset posture and alignment before continuing.
Now the motion mirrors to the right. Rotate the pelvis in a counterclockwise arc, sweeping from her right wall to her south wall. Keep the depth shallow and the motion fluid, exhaling through the turn. With a penis above seven inches, restraint becomes the mark of mastery; every fraction of pressure counts, so avoid thrusting through the rotation. Instead, imagine tracing the wall with precision, as if drawing a circle from inside. When her breath deepens or her hips subtly meet you, transition again into the right north lift. Tilt forward and up at the same controlled mid-depth, maintaining Medium pressure. The movement feels like a gentle cresting wave—a moment of firmness that never turns into force.
As before, you complete the orbit with the returning crush-release. Drop the hips, inhale, and let everything soften back to center. The six keystrokes now form one continuous circle—left rotation, north lift, release, right rotation, north lift, release—each connected by breath and sensitivity rather than muscle drive. The rhythm follows a natural cadence: exhale through motion, inhale through release. For the Mesomorph, endurance depends on keeping each phase clean and minimal, never chasing force. Focus on longevity of motion—ten orbits sustained at a calm tempo will yield more mastery than short bursts of intensity.
The full stroke should feel like a compass turning slowly under your skin. The Rocking phases (rotations) provide lateral sway; the Angling phases (lifts) offer vertical dimension. The crush-releases are where rhythm breathes. Your goal is to keep every orbit identical in length and pressure, forming a steady tempo that can be felt as a hypnotic pattern by both bodies. When her body grows still or her exhale syncs with yours, you’ve found the shared rhythm—stay there, repeating without change for at least two full minutes to train your endurance.
If fatigue sets in, lower your knees, rest one breath, then rise again. Always preserve alignment: shoulders stacked over elbows, hips level, spine neutral. For safety, never drop pressure below control—every release should be guided, not collapsed.
After training, write a one-line reflection such as, “Full orbits linked, shallow 80%, smooth breath, hips aligned, her hips met lift by orbit three.” This confirms you felt both the rhythm and her response.
When you can sustain at least eight continuous orbits without losing breath or alignment, you’re ready to begin testing these loops under the SSP Tracking phase.

===========================================================================
Module 4 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles moves into the Tracking Phase, where precision replaces repetition. This is where you begin applying the SSP loop—Define, Hypothesize, Track, and Refine—to observe how her body responds to subtle variations in pressure, angle, and timing. Start from the neutral forearm-plank baseline. Your knees rest softly on the mat, your shoulders stacked over elbows, and your pelvis hovering just above hers. Take two deep breaths to stabilize the spine and calm the nervous system. Your first objective is to define your working range: stay in the shallow 80% depth, maintaining Light-to-Medium pressure. The point here is not stimulation but information. Each movement should act as a question you ask through touch, and her body’s breath, movement, or stillness is the answer.
Begin with a slow left rotation. Exhale as your left hip draws forward, tracing the shaft from her left wall toward the south wall. Keep the motion deliberate and smooth. Watch her cues carefully—if she exhales through her mouth or her hips tilt forward, that means the angle meets her comfort zone. Inhale as you return to baseline, logging mentally that the left side responds to shallow diagonal Rocking. Now repeat on the right. The Mesomorph body has the benefit of stability but must resist the temptation to force symmetry. Often, one wall reacts faster than the other, and part of tracking is learning that imbalance. If her right wall feels tighter or her breath shortens, lighten pressure and shorten the angle. Your hypothesis might be that she favors left-side stimulation or that right-side tension requires warming.
Move next into the north lifts, maintaining mid-depth at 10%. The shift from Rocking to Angling should be felt through the abdomen, not the shoulders. Engage your core as you inhale, tilt forward as you exhale, pressing gently into the upper wall. Her response will guide you: a held breath or a pelvic curl usually indicates the angle is effective; a withdrawal means reduce pressure or adjust depth. Keep track mentally—north angles often awaken intensity faster, so balance them with longer crush-releases afterward to calm the system. This alternation between stimulation and relief is part of your refinement cycle.
The crush-release itself is also a tool for tracking. As you drop the hips and lighten pressure, observe how her breath changes. If she exhales deeply and her shoulders relax, the release has done its job. If she stays tense, linger another breath before resuming movement. Every cue matters. This is how you refine—not by counting repetitions but by matching your actions to her nervous system’s rhythm.
The Mesomorph’s strength allows consistency but can also conceal overdrive. Keep the pace intentionally slow—one orbit every ten seconds. This gives you enough time to notice small feedback shifts. Remember, the goal in Tracking is not to make her cum; it’s to learn her landscape. Stay shallow, stay calm, stay curious. You are gathering data. Each orbit teaches you how her south, north, and diagonal walls communicate. You are building a mental map, one orbit at a time.
After each practice, write a single reflection sentence. Something like, “Left wall opened faster, shallow 80%, Medium pressure steady, right wall resisted until breath slowed.” This simple line marks your observations without judgment, ready to test next time.
When you can sustain steady orbits while reading her feedback without rushing or guessing, you are ready to move from analysis to flow—where tracking turns into seamless connection.

===========================================================================
Module 5 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles moves you into Flow Phase, where every keystroke merges into continuous motion guided by breath and sensation. This is the point where you stop thinking about technique and begin feeling rhythm as instinct. Start again in neutral forearm-plank. The spine stays long, the hips hover above hers, and your breath sets the metronome. Inhale to prepare, exhale to move. Flow begins at the shallow 80% depth, using Light-to-Medium pressure, but as you find rhythm, you may rise into mid-depth on the upward arcs if her body opens and signals readiness. Your purpose now is to sustain movement without breaks, holding wall contact with smooth consistency.
Begin the orbit on the left side. As you exhale, rotate your hips clockwise, tracing from her left wall down toward the south. Keep your upper body still so the motion radiates from your lower core, letting Rocking and Angling merge seamlessly. You should feel the head and shaft slide across her inner texture with no friction or stutter. The Mesomorph’s strength can make rotation too forceful—avoid any muscular shove. Let gravity and controlled pelvic roll do the work. When you feel her hips subtly press in or her exhale deepen, use that cue to rise into the north lift. You inhale to anchor, exhale through the forward tilt, reaching toward her north wall at mid-depth. Maintain Medium pressure here, no higher. The goal is not impact but continuity—your shaft should seem to glide along an invisible orbiting track.
Flow depends on timing. Each orbit is a breath: rotation on the exhale, lift through the next exhale, release on the inhale. This breathing pattern ensures both control and endurance. As you drop from the north lift back into center, lighten to Light pressure, inhale, and feel her walls draw you inward. The release should feel like floating down a gentle current. Then rotate right, repeating the same pattern in reverse. Her cues become your tempo. If her breath slows, match it. If her hips begin to roll under you, mirror that energy but never lead with force. The Mesomorph’s job is to channel stability, to hold space for the movement to unfold, not to chase intensity.
The rhythm’s sensation for her is one of circular hypnosis—pressure gliding in and out like a tide that never breaks. When you sustain ten orbits without losing alignment or breath, you’ll notice a shift: her exhale will deepen into moans, her body will stay still between rotations instead of resisting. That is Flow’s confirmation. When this happens, you can safely expand your range slightly, pressing deeper into the 10% mid zone on the north lift. With a penis above seven inches, depth control is essential—never drive deeper than the head’s full slide. Let your awareness gauge resistance. If her body pulls away or tightens, retreat immediately to shallow range. Flow thrives on trust, not penetration depth.
As the body warms, alternate tempo: three slow orbits followed by one slightly faster. This natural pulse keeps the nervous system engaged without breaking the trance. You’ll sense her responses shifting from mechanical to involuntary—the kind of movement that rises from instinct, not choice. When her pelvis begins to follow the circle on its own, you’ve reached Flow resonance. Stay there for several minutes, breathing together.
After each session, journal in a single sentence to capture what worked and what changed. For example: “Flow stable, shallow 80% with brief mid lift, Medium pressure smooth, her hips followed rhythm by orbit eight.” This shorthand marks your entry point into sustained rhythm.
Flow Phase ends when motion feels effortless and the breath leads the body, not the other way around. Once this consistency is mastered, you’re ready to explore how Flow extends deeper without breaking safety or alignment.

===========================================================================
Module 6 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles brings you into the Deep Flow option—the controlled expansion into the mid and deep 10% zones. This stage is not about dominance or penetration power; it’s about mastering restraint under intensity. Depth becomes a precision tool, not a goal. Begin as always in your neutral forearm-plank baseline. The Mesomorph frame gives you excellent leverage, but that leverage must now serve stability, not drive. Take a full inhale and feel your hips align with hers before beginning the orbit. Your awareness should stay at the base of the pelvis, not the thrust.
Start with the left rotation, shallow and smooth at 80% depth. Exhale through the arc, feeling how her walls guide the line toward the south. Once her body relaxes and begins to meet your motion, transition into the north lift, but this time allow your pelvis to tilt just a few degrees deeper—mid-depth, no more than 10% beyond your usual range. Engage your abdomen, inhale to prepare, exhale through the lift. Medium pressure should rise gradually, never forced. With a penis above seven inches, the margin for safety is narrow. Think of it as painting with the head of your shaft rather than pushing with the base. Her cue for readiness is always surrender: a deeper exhale, a slight arch, a pelvic curl drawing you in. Anything else—tension, held breath, stillness—means stay shallow.
As you hold the mid-depth orbit, feel the change in internal resistance. The walls compress more tightly; the gliding texture thickens. This is the deep field. You must slow your rotation tempo by half. Each orbit should take about fifteen seconds—five for the rotation, five for the lift, five for the release. The goal is to let pressure expand her gradually. Imagine your motion as a slow spiral carving through warm water. The metaphor is not about force but flow—each inch should feel guided, not taken. When her hips start to roll subtly against you, you can test slightly deeper entry into the lower north quadrant, but never exceed a gentle Medium pressure. Deep zones are cervix territory; her breath will tell you instantly if you’ve reached that edge. A small gasp or tightening under you means back off immediately, exhale, and retreat to the mid zone. Safety builds trust, and trust builds arousal.
Lubrication is your governor here. If friction increases, stop and re-lubricate. Never push through drag. Deep pressure is only effective when the glide is seamless. You’ll notice how her inner walls begin to pulse on their own when you maintain the right depth for long enough. These involuntary contractions are the body’s acknowledgment that you’ve found resonance. Use them as your feedback signal: hold the orbit steady and breathe with her, matching exhale to exhale. If her body begins to go quiet—less motion, more stillness—you’re in cervix adjacency. Ease pressure, slide shallow, and stay there for at least two breaths before resuming.
As a Mesomorph, manage your energy output by tightening your abdominal wall slightly on every inhale to support the lumbar spine. Keep shoulders relaxed and elbows firm. This posture allows you to sustain deep Flow without overloading your joints. Depth work taxes the hips and lower back—maintain small breaks every three to four minutes. During rest, stay connected by keeping the head of your shaft just inside, Light pressure, breathing together.
After training, journal in one clear sentence: “Mid-depth 10%, Medium pressure steady, her breath deepened, pulled away at cervix contact, retreated one degree shallow, smooth reconnection.” This reflection tracks awareness rather than performance.
When you can navigate between shallow, mid, and early deep zones without breaking rhythm or causing withdrawal, you’ve mastered depth gating. This sets you up for the final refinement—using pressure, tempo, and micro-angle shifts to ignite and sustain multiple orgasms through pinning.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles with Body Type Mesomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


===========================================================================
Module 7 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles brings you into the Pinning Phase—the art of maintaining deep resonance while sparking multiple orgasms through micro-adjustments. This stage is less about motion and more about awareness under stillness. You are no longer orbiting continuously; you are holding her in the center of the storm. Begin again in your neutral forearm-plank. Your weight is evenly distributed through forearms and knees, spine long, pelvis aligned over hers. Inhale to stabilize, exhale to settle the shaft at mid-depth, maintaining gentle contact against her north wall. The head should rest at the point where pressure feels full but not invasive. This is your anchor.
From here, enter the Observe stage of SSP. Feel how her breath meets yours. If she exhales softly and her hips remain still, she’s attuned. If she tenses or holds her breath, reduce depth slightly. Observation teaches you her recovery rhythm after deep Flow. You’re watching how her body processes intensity. Once you sense her breathing deepen again, move to Tweak. This is where micro-angle shifts begin. Imagine your hips as a compass needle adjusting a few degrees east or west. Each angle change should be no more than a finger-width. These shifts create new wall contacts that reignite stimulation without breaking her trance. Inhale before each adjustment, exhale as you rotate. The Mesomorph’s strength must be tempered with control—your core stability keeps these tweaks precise and safe.
When she starts to breathe faster or release a low sound, you move into Test. Keep the same depth but increase tempo slightly—tiny pelvic pulses through the abdomen, not the hips. The movement should feel like small waves pressing against her from the inside. This is the Pinning effect: sustained presence with rhythm nested inside stillness. You may notice her body trembling or arching upward. Resist the urge to chase her motion. Hold your baseline, match her breath, and let her contractions crest. Your awareness remains fixed on her exhale; it will tell you when she peaks. After each wave, pause, inhale, and drop pressure lightly. This reset keeps her body from numbing to the sensation. Then reapply Medium pressure on the next exhale and repeat. Three to four of these micro-cycles can build layered orgasms that unfold one after another.
For a penis above seven inches, restraint is everything during Pinning. Depth must never increase beyond the established mid or early deep zone. The longer length provides natural fullness, so your job is to pulse sensation, not push deeper. If you feel the cervix barrier or she gasps sharply, immediately lighten and pivot angle downward. Use Light pressure and shallow Rocking to soothe before returning to baseline. The Mesomorph body allows perfect reentry when balance and breathing are maintained. Keep shoulders low, elbows steady, and abs engaged to absorb the recoil of each pulse without losing form.
Her cues will evolve from movement to stillness. At this stage, pleasure translates into surrender. When her hips stop meeting you and her breath evens out into long exhales, she’s entering aftershocks. Stay connected through presence alone. No movement. Just breath. Your shaft becomes a grounding post, helping her nervous system integrate. Hold that space until her pulse stabilizes, then slowly ease out while maintaining contact with your body. This closing gesture resets her trust and prepares both of you for reflection.
Afterward, journal in one clear sentence: “Pinned mid-depth, Medium pressure steady, micro-shifts east-west, her breath peaked twice before stillness, eased out on shared exhale.” This captures your session’s rhythm and feedback for future refinement.
When you can sustain presence, read cues accurately, and modulate energy without needing motion, you have mastered the control that defines an advanced practitioner. The next module will integrate everything into a four-week cycle that builds endurance, sensitivity, and mental precision.

===========================================================================
Module 8 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles teaches you how to build a four-week integration plan that turns the motion patterns you’ve learned into a consistent, repeatable practice. The goal is endurance, precision, and nervous-system familiarity—training your body to move through each wall and depth zone without drift or tension. You begin each session in the neutral forearm-plank baseline, knees grounded, spine long, pelvis balanced. For the first week, you’ll rebuild stability through stillness. Insert to the shallow 80 percent depth with Light pressure, inhale to lengthen the spine, and exhale to let your hips settle. Each breath should feel like you’re teaching your body to hold her weight without collapsing. Mesomorphs tend to overdrive the hips; stay aware of the thighs and abdomen doing equal work so the lower back stays quiet. Keep each hold for five minutes, rest, then repeat. The effect of this still practice is improved pelvic steadiness and more accurate wall sensing when you return to motion. Journal in one line: “Held shallow anchor five minutes, Light pressure steady, hips relaxed after three breaths.”
In week two, you rebuild orbit control. Return to the shallow 80 percent depth and begin the Rocking sequence that forms the base of the Egyptian pattern. Rotate the hips left through a slow inhale and right through a slow exhale. Each orbit should match one breath cycle so rhythm and respiration stay married. When you can hold ten minutes of this circular flow without breaking form, add small Angling adjustments toward the east and west walls, maintaining Medium pressure. Because your length exceeds seven inches, never exceed the 80 percent gate during orbits; the long shaft already supplies full coverage of the vaginal walls. The internal effect is a smoother glide and a lower pelvic burn rate. Reflection after training: notice how much less correction you need in your hips compared to week one.
Week three brings the pinning and pulse integration. Work in the mid-depth 10 percent zone and use the same forearm-plank base. Start by exhaling into a single insertion at mid depth, applying Medium pressure until you feel her inner walls settle around you. Hold that stillness for fifteen seconds, then add a micro Rocking pulse east-west for another fifteen. Each pulse should come from your abdomen, not your hips. After thirty seconds, inhale and return to neutral baseline. Repeat this five-minute cycle four times. Her breathing or pelvic curl will tell you when the pulse sequence is aligned; if her breath deepens or she presses back, maintain the rhythm. The goal is to read her nervous-system timing and control your own endurance without losing structure. The internal effect is a calm burn in the core with warmth behind the navel; the reflection is about breath discipline under tension. Journal shorthand: “Pinned mid 10 percent, pulse 15/15 s cycles x4, breath matched, held baseline.”
Week four unifies all previous work into a single twenty-minute continuous session. Begin at shallow 80 percent with Light pressure for three minutes to warm the muscles, transition into mid-depth orbits for five minutes at Medium pressure, enter pinning for another five minutes, then retreat to shallow Rocking for two minutes before finishing with stillness for the last five. Treat this as a conversation between movement and recovery rather than a performance. Every transition returns through the neutral baseline so the joints reset before the next motion. For a Mesomorph frame, the heavier core can fatigue quickly in this long set, so schedule a rest day every fourth day and keep hydration high. If you feel lumbar strain or numbness, shorten the mid-depth segment and expand the shallow phase instead. The purpose is sustainability, not exhaustion.
Across these four weeks, you will feel your timing sharpen until movement, breath, and awareness merge. The Egyptian Orbiting Circles then stop being a sequence of actions and become a single rhythmic continuum. She will recognize it not as technique but as stability—the sense that every motion carries confidence and awareness. Each journaling line marks one more data point in your control curve, proving that what began as structure has turned into instinct.
