Module 1 teaches you how to build the foundation of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles by mastering posture, breath, and depth control. Your goal is to feel stable in plank, move from a clean baseline, and protect your joints while learning to sense every wall without strain. Begin in a forearm plank position with your elbows directly beneath your shoulders and your forearms flat on the ground. Keep your knees slightly apart to relieve lower-back tension. For an endomorph body, stability comes from grounding your mass into the floor—use your weight as an anchor instead of fighting it. Draw a long breath in through the nose, then exhale through the mouth until your abdomen firms slightly; this breath sets your rhythm and keeps pressure consistent.
From this baseline, start with a simple Rocking motion. Gently shift your hips forward and back along the east-west axis at Light pressure. Keep the movement within the shallow 80% zone—your focus is not penetration depth but compass control. The breath should guide you: inhale as you pull back, exhale as you move forward. This rhythm teaches the nervous system how to sync movement with breath. For a penis above seven inches, maintain awareness of the tip’s travel distance; never exceed shallow depth until you can consistently hold spinal alignment. If your hips sag or your shoulders drift, return to neutral plank, reset, and start again. A short journal tag after each set can read: “Baseline steady, 80%, east-west, Light pressure.”
Next, practice Angling by slightly tilting your pelvis diagonally toward the southeast wall during the exhale and returning northwest on the inhale. This action introduces oblique loading—feel the abdominal muscles engage as you guide the motion. Keep it slow and deliberate, still at shallow depth. The goal is wall clarity: sensing when your tip grazes lateral resistance without pressure spikes. Because of your heavier frame, rely on controlled exhalation rather than thrust force; it protects your wrists and lower back from compression. Pause for one breath in neutral baseline after every five angled rocks to reset joint tension.
Once you can hold stability for three minutes without collapse, combine Rocking and Angling lightly in one breath cycle—forward on exhale, diagonal on inhale, neutral at the pause. You should begin to feel circular potential forming in your hips. The metaphor here is a pendulum—steady, weighted, returning perfectly to center each time. Do not chase speed; chase repeatable geometry. Each cycle reinforces body memory of alignment and depth boundaries. If you notice shoulder fatigue, shorten your lever by widening the elbows slightly and re-centering the pelvis.
Finish every session by returning to neutral plank for five deep breaths. Feel your weight settle evenly between forearms and knees, spine long, shoulders loose. This closure resets nervous load and prepares your joints for recovery. Endomorph bodies benefit from these pauses—the mass you carry becomes an advantage when you can control its drop and flow. Write one reflective note after practice such as: “Three-minute hold, smooth pendulum, no collapse.” This single sentence marks your data for the SSP tracking loop.
Over time, this orientation builds the architecture that supports every Egyptian Orbiting Circle. Your breath, alignment, and restraint define the quality of every future stroke.

==========================================================================================
Module 2 breaks down the keystrokes that form the core mechanics of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles. Each keystroke is a building block—trained individually first, then chained later into full circular rhythm. For an endomorph body and a penis above seven inches, leverage and stability must always lead the movement. The extra mass and length give you more natural weight behind the stroke, but they also demand discipline in depth gating and joint control. Every keystroke here lives inside the shallow 80% zone until your breathing and control become automatic.
Begin with the Lateral Rock. From a neutral plank, move the hips side to side as if tracing the rim of a bowl. The motion is Rocking, not thrusting, shifting weight across the east and west walls. Inhale through the center, exhale as you roll left or right. Keep the pressure Light and consistent. The longer shaft will create more wall contact—use this to feel texture changes rather than to push deeper. This keystroke teaches you to read resistance across both sides evenly. After five clean passes, pause in neutral, breathe twice, and feel the echo of motion fading. Your journal shorthand can read: “Lateral 80% Light@10.”
Next is the Forward Angle Press, which introduces front-wall sensitivity and pressure control. From neutral, slightly angle the hips toward the southeast wall, exhaling as you shift weight forward, inhaling as you pull back to baseline. This movement blends Rocking and Angling: a diagonal press, not a straight thrust. Because of your mass, engage core muscles to lift slightly as you push to avoid collapsing into your shoulders. Stay at Light-to-Medium pressure. With a longer penis, full length will naturally reach near mid-depth even on shallow intent; therefore, prioritize breath control to gate that entry. A clean cue is when you feel tension ease just before the exhale ends—stop there.
Then comes the Drop-and-Roll Reset. This keystroke restores rhythm and reinforces spinal neutrality. From forward angle, exhale and allow the hips to drop a fraction toward the mat while rolling slightly backward, like returning west with gravity’s help. This is a Rocking motion, smooth and heavy. It clears tension from the lumbar region and resets you to shallow depth. For an endomorph, this move absorbs joint load and keeps motion fluid. Never force the roll—let weight carry you and spine stay loose. Journal example: “Drop/Roll reset, 80%, Medium pressure, hips loose.”
Finally, integrate the North-South Sweep, which tests your sense of alignment. Start in neutral, inhale, and move hips forward toward north, then back toward south on the exhale. Keep the action minimal and circular in intention, connecting the Lateral Rock and Forward Angle Press through breath timing. The motion should feel like your hips are sketching a small oval on the compass, teaching the nervous system the geometry that defines The Egyptian Orbiting Circles. Endomorph weight will add momentum; slow it down to preserve clarity. You should feel a balanced draw across all four walls without slipping into deep 10% penetration.
Across all these keystrokes, your breath remains your metronome and your joints your limiter. The aim isn’t repetition count but precision—each keystroke fluent enough to hold without thought. The body learns by clear cycles and neutral resets. As each pattern stabilizes, your nervous system begins mapping the circular architecture you’ll soon build into full orbit. End each session by returning to plank, breathing evenly, and letting the muscles soften so you can sense the memory of motion lingering through your hips and spine.
Ready to proceed to Module 3 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


==========================================================================================
Module 3 teaches you how to construct The Egyptian Orbiting Circles from the keystrokes you’ve already trained. Now the movements become one living rhythm—a loop that flows around her inner compass like a slow orbit, tracing energy rather than chasing friction. For an endomorph body and a penis above seven inches, your focus must be on pacing and precision. Your strength and weight can easily overpower the subtler muscle sequencing needed for this stroke. The goal is to feel the walls receive you evenly, never jolt or tighten.
Start from a clean forearm plank. Breathe in until your ribs expand. On the exhale, begin the Lateral Rock—hips gliding left and right, each motion slow enough that you can feel your shaft roll across the inside edge of her east and west walls. After two or three lateral cycles, add the Forward Angle Press at the top of the left sweep, guiding your hips toward the southeast corner, inhaling to prepare, exhaling to press. The moment you feel her hips respond—usually a subtle tilt or breath release—return through center and repeat the same logic on the right. The stroke should now start to resemble a smooth infinity loop between east-south-west and back to center.
The Drop-and-Roll Reset acts as your hinge between circuits. After a full left-right loop, exhale and let your hips sink just slightly down and back, spine long, elbows grounded. This prevents fatigue and keeps the orbit continuous rather than rigid. For your body type, this drop is where weight management happens; let your core and forearms bear the load so your lower back never compresses. Inhale on the return to center, keeping the chest lifted. The sequence becomes a breathing wheel: Rock, Angle, Reset, and Breathe.
Now connect the North-South Sweep as the top layer of geometry. From center, as your hips pass through either lateral side, continue the arc forward to north, grazing the upper wall, then roll back toward south as you reset. It should feel like your pelvis is tracing the rim of a wide bowl. Keep the depth in the shallow 80%, but let the tip explore the edge of the mid 10% only when her breath deepens and her hips follow. Never chase that space; allow it to open naturally. For a shaft above seven inches, this means only half the visible length enters on the deepest reach. That restraint creates sensitivity—your leverage amplifies sensation without losing control.
Each full circle should flow through eight to ten breath cycles before you pause. You’ll know you’re in rhythm when your breath and hers fall into sync and every wall contact feels soft yet deliberate. She’ll often still slightly at the northward sweep, then draw in a breath at the return south; that’s the nervous system syncing with your orbit. Your only task is to stay aware—watch the cues, track tension, and adjust. If she stiffens, drop the pressure from Medium to Light and shorten the radius of your circle for a few breaths. When she melts, return to the full compass.
The entire rhythm should feel less like thrusting and more like painting with heat. You’re teaching your body to maintain a continuous loop without collapse. When done correctly, her pelvis begins to follow the orbit unconsciously, and you’ll both move as if magnetized. That is the beginning of true Flow, which we’ll refine in the next module.
Ready to proceed to Module 4 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


==========================================================================================
Module 4 begins your Tracking Phase—the scientific foundation that transforms The Egyptian Orbiting Circles from movement into mastery. This is where you use the SSP loop in real time: Define, Hypothesize, Track, and Refine. The practice now shifts from raw mechanics to observation and data. The shallow 80% zone becomes your laboratory. You’ll test how small variations in angle, rhythm, and pressure affect sensation, stability, and partner response. For an endomorph body with a penis above seven inches, this phase prevents the common error of overpowering early Flow. Instead, you’ll learn precision through control, not force.
Begin each session by defining your target variable—one aspect of the orbit you’ll track. Choose a focus like “lateral balance” or “front-wall sensitivity.” Stay at Light pressure and shallow 80% depth. Enter plank, inhale deeply, and on the exhale begin the orbit using the four trained keystrokes: Lateral Rock, Forward Angle Press, Drop-and-Roll Reset, and North-South Sweep. Keep the orbit slow, circular, and identical for ten breath cycles. As you move, pay attention to the moment where resistance shifts or sensation drops—these are your data points. Her breathing and pelvic micro-movements are the feedback channels. When she inhales sharply, you’ve met tension; when she exhales with sound or deepens her hips, you’ve found a release.
After each set, pause in neutral baseline for three breaths and record your shorthand journal tag. A note might read: “E-W stable, loss of contact at SE wall@cycle6.” These records train your awareness to recognize consistency and drift. For an endomorph, stability often comes easy, but transitions are slower due to momentum. Track how long it takes you to return cleanly to center after a lateral sweep. If it exceeds one breath, shorten your stroke arc slightly next round. Your size and weight magnify error if timing lags—precision, not speed, protects rhythm.
On every second set, alter a single variable deliberately. Increase pressure from Light to Medium while maintaining shallow depth, or add half a breath pause at the south return before rolling north again. Hypothesize how this will change wall contact—perhaps a firmer grip or a delay in her reaction. Then test for ten cycles and record what actually occurs. This keeps the SSP loop alive: you are constantly defining, testing, observing, and refining. Never change more than one variable at a time. Each shift teaches your nervous system how geometry and tension interplay.
During Tracking, the goal isn’t arousal but calibration. Keep every repetition precise enough that you can predict how she’ll react. For a longer shaft, pay close attention to wall slip—the moment the tip glides too freely and connection feels hollow. That’s your cue that pressure or angle drifted. Return to neutral baseline, breathe, and restart. This discipline builds proprioceptive mapping: you start to sense the orbit’s integrity without needing to look or think. The heavy frame of the endomorph becomes an asset here—your mass amplifies micro-resistance, giving clearer feedback if you stay patient.
End each session by closing the loop intentionally. From your final orbit, exhale and allow the hips to settle back, spine neutral, shoulders loose. Feel the echo of circular motion still alive in your core even though you’ve stopped. That awareness—the phantom of movement—is the nervous system memorizing efficiency. Take one last note: “Stable loop, 10 cycles, smooth SE entry@Medium.” These lines become your archive of sensitivity. Each set refines not just muscle control, but your ability to perceive her response as data, not guesswork.
Ready to proceed to Module 5 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


==========================================================================================
Module 5 opens the Flow Phase, where The Egyptian Orbiting Circles becomes one unbroken rhythm. All the calibration work from Tracking now merges into a living, sensual motion that sustains itself without analysis. You are no longer testing—you are inhabiting the stroke. For an endomorph body with a penis above seven inches, the discipline here is restraint through grace. Your power and size make Flow easier to initiate but harder to sustain. The aim is to move as a slow current, not a crashing tide.
Start in forearm plank with a full inhale, letting the ribs expand and the hips settle. On the exhale, ease into orbit using the full keystroke chain: Lateral Rock → Forward Angle Press → Drop-and-Roll Reset → North-South Sweep. The entire circuit should last four to five breaths. The pressure stays in Light-to-Medium range, depth within the shallow 80% zone, allowing only natural glides into the edge of the mid 10% when her breath deepens or hips reach up to meet you. The Flow rhythm feels continuous—each movement feeds the next with no break or stutter. Keep your core lifted just enough that your weight rides the motion instead of pressing down. This protects both your stamina and her pelvic freedom.
Flow is defined by consistency of contact. With your length, the tip will sweep across all four inner quadrants effortlessly, but the challenge lies in maintaining equal attention to every wall. During the leftward orbit, ensure the right side of your abdomen doesn’t sag; symmetry keeps the stroke circular. You’ll feel her breathing sync within minutes if you’ve balanced the geometry. Her exhale will often land on your forward press, and her inhale during your roll back. That is the shared rhythm you’re aiming for—the signal that Flow has arrived. If she stiffens or breath catches high in the chest, drop immediately into Drop-and-Roll Reset, breathe together, and restart smaller.
Think of Flow as a slow orbit around a glowing core. Your hips trace the shape of a planet circling its sun, drawn by gravity rather than effort. This single grounded metaphor captures how effortless it should feel when you’re aligned. The movement sustains itself—energy moves through you rather than from you. Keep every exhale long and audible; the sound helps maintain pace. For an endomorph, fatigue can creep in through the shoulders and lower back, so distribute weight evenly across forearms and toes, engaging your abdomen to float your torso. Rest briefly in neutral every ten orbits to reset circulation before continuing.
The sweet spot of Flow lies in matching her internal response with your external rhythm. When she begins to breathe rhythmically, hips subtly tracing your same orbit from underneath, the nervous systems have entrained. At that moment, stay there. Don’t increase speed or pressure. Let her hips lead for a few cycles while you maintain circular stability. This trust loop deepens her surrender and amplifies the internal suction effect of the orbit’s geometry. You’ll feel the entire canal pulse softly around the mid-shaft—evidence that you’re working with her body, not against it.
When the session ends, stop without breaking the rhythm. Exhale through the final orbit and return to plank with the same breath that began it. This symmetrical closure reinforces neural memory of control and composure. Record a simple note afterward: “Full Flow, 80% depth, Medium pressure, synced breath at cycle eight.” Flow mastery isn’t about volume—it’s about precision maintained through pleasure. Once you can sustain twenty uninterrupted cycles without drift or tension, you’re ready to touch the mid-to-deep expansion that comes next.
Ready to proceed to Module 6 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


==========================================================================================
Module 6 opens the Deep Flow option—your controlled descent into the mid and deep 10% zones of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles. This is not an invitation to drive harder; it’s a lesson in depth management, safety, and surrender within discipline. For an endomorph body with a penis above seven inches, the power you hold in your hips can overwhelm her internal structure if you skip control. Deep Flow isn’t about penetration—it’s about precision under tension. You are learning how to apply presence at depth without disturbing softness.
Begin in a fully neutral plank, spine long, core engaged. Inhale deeply to lift your hips half an inch higher than baseline; this opens the angle of entry so that when you exhale and lower, you’re gliding forward—not plunging. Enter orbit with Light pressure through the shallow 80%, tracing the circular path you’ve mastered. As the rotation feels frictionless and her hips begin to follow your motion, that’s your cue to test a mid-depth glide. On the next forward press, shift the angle subtly northward, exhale, and allow just one extra centimeter of entry—nothing more. Watch her response closely. Her hips may pull in slightly, her breath deepen, or her body may still. That stillness is acceptance; it means the deeper zone is ready.
Stay in this mid 10% depth for three cycles at most, keeping pressure Medium and breathing long. If the response remains soft and rhythmic, you may expand to the full deep 10% zone by gently rolling your pelvis north at the top of the orbit. Think of this as tilting a bowl until its rim kisses the edge—never a shove, always a glide. With your size, the cervix will be within easy reach; direct contact isn’t the goal. Maintain the orbit so that the deepest point of entry brushes near the cervix rather than colliding with it. If she flinches, gasps sharply, or tightens, withdraw half an inch immediately and return to mid-depth until her breath softens again. Deep Flow demands patience; each expansion teaches your nervous systems to align under greater intensity.
At depth, your Rocking and Angling merge into one rolling continuum. The hips move as if stirring a heavy liquid, each rotation redistributing warmth. The internal effect for her is a dense, magnetic fullness—pressure evenly circling instead of driving. For you, it should feel like time slows down and the pelvis floats in slow motion. This is where control meets surrender. Keep the exhale constant through each northward pass to bleed tension out of your spine and forearms. Inhale on the south return to collect strength without losing rhythm.
Lubrication becomes a key safety factor at this stage. The deep zone produces natural suction; if it dries or grips too hard, break rhythm and re-lubricate externally before resuming. Never let ego override the feedback of texture. For an endomorph, use your mass to stabilize—not to bear down. Let gravity assist your orbit rather than drive it. Your job is to maintain spinal length and prevent collapse into her pelvis. Depth control is a game of angles, not thrusts.
End each session by gradually shrinking the orbit radius. On your last few cycles, lighten pressure back to Medium, lift the hips slightly, and let the shaft glide only within the shallow 80%. This taper teaches your body how to exit intensity with grace. Finish with one long breath, exhaling as you settle into neutral plank. Record a final line in your journal: “Deep 10%, north wall brush, Medium pressure, full release@cycle3.” This marks not conquest but clarity—you’ve touched depth without losing control.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


==========================================================================================
Module 7 enters the Pinning Phase—the art of holding pleasure steady after orgasmic release. The Egyptian Orbiting Circles becomes a field of micro-adjustments designed to extend, reshape, or restart waves of climax. For an endomorph body with a penis above seven inches, this stage demands gentleness with structure and precision with breath. Your strength can easily overpower the sensitivity that emerges here, so you must master stillness as a weapon. This module turns you from mover to conductor—controlling current through angle, pressure, and timing while her body trembles on the edge.
Start immediately after the first orgasmic peak, either hers or yours. Do not withdraw. Stay inside the shallow 80% and breathe through the stillness. Inhale slowly through your nose and exhale softly through your mouth, letting the rhythm match her recovery. Your first task is to observe—the O in the SSP loop (Observe → Tweak → Test). Feel for how her canal changes texture. It will tighten near the entrance while softening toward the back. That contrast is your map. Use the Lateral Rock keystroke at Light pressure, tracing a slow figure-eight that brushes the east and west walls alternately. Keep the movement so small it barely looks like motion; think of it as stirring the surface of a pond. This gentle oscillation restimulates her without breaking recovery.
When you feel her breath deepen or hips press subtly forward again, you enter the Tweak phase. Add a hint of the Forward Angle Press at Medium pressure, rolling north with a long exhale. This reawakens the north wall’s tension points and usually triggers an aftershock. Her cues will be unmistakable—hips tightening, breath catching low, or small involuntary moans. Freeze at the edge of her response. The key to Pinning is not repetition but suspension. You’re holding her between contraction and release, letting the body choose direction. Count three breaths in that stillness before easing back into the orbit.
For an endomorph, leverage and core control define success here. Keep your weight lifted through the shoulders and hips so pressure stays within your control. A heavy drop breaks the pin; a hovering pelvis keeps her body in that electric limbo. Because of your length, limit depth to mid 10% during any active re-entry—this prevents cervix contact when tissues are hypersensitive. The Drop-and-Roll Reset becomes your safety valve: when her body stiffens too much or your own arousal spikes, roll south and settle back to shallow 80%, breathing until softness returns.
Pinning trains the nervous system to stay inside high sensation without fleeing. Each micro-shift of angle or tempo tests how far you can sustain arousal before breaking rhythm. Try reducing speed by half and maintaining continuous contact for at least five breaths without losing form. That control refines both endurance and awareness. The result for her is wave after wave—each one smaller, tighter, more internal than the last. For you, it’s the rewiring of reflex from release to mastery.
Close the phase by returning to baseline with grace. On your final orbit, exhale fully and let the hips settle into stillness. Stay connected, forehead to hers, allowing your breath to sync once more. The stillness becomes your anchor—proof that control isn’t absence of feeling, but complete command of it. Record a final note in your shorthand journal: “Pin held 3 breaths, mid 10%, Medium pressure, full sync@exit.” Each repetition in this phase rewires the body to treat climax not as an end but as an opening.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for The Egyptian Orbiting Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


==========================================================================================
Module 8 brings everything together—the integration of skill, stamina, and self-control into a four-week practice plan that makes The Egyptian Orbiting Circles second nature. The goal now is rhythm reliability. You’re no longer learning how to move; you’re teaching your nervous system how to maintain command under any level of arousal. For an endomorph with a penis above seven inches, this means refining endurance through controlled pacing and stable angles, never relying on force. Each week builds consistency, from posture integrity to deep-flow calibration, leading to effortless control and connection.
In the first week, your focus is the body. Every session starts in neutral plank. Forearms grounded, shoulders over elbows, hips lifted just enough to free pressure from your spine. Inhale to set alignment, exhale to engage the core, then spend five to seven minutes cycling between neutral holds and Light-pressure Lateral Rocks. The purpose here is sensory mapping—learning how each compass wall feels through minimal motion. Stay shallow within 80% depth, journaling one simple observation each session, like “South wall steady, Medium pressure, smooth breath@rep10.” That small act of awareness teaches your brain to track subtleties instead of chasing intensity.
In the second week, you shift from awareness to articulation. Begin linking your keystrokes—Lateral Rock, Forward Angle Press, Drop-and-Roll Reset, and North-South Sweep—into the full circular orbit. Keep everything slow and deliberate, five breaths per cycle. Practice this in two sets per session with a one-minute neutral rest between. Your objective isn’t endurance yet; it’s muscle memory. Focus on symmetry—both directions of the orbit must feel identical. Her imagined cues guide you: deeper exhale means alignment; tension or withdrawal means imbalance. Each repetition solidifies the rhythm architecture beneath your strength.
By week three, Flow replaces analysis. You’re now sustaining twenty continuous orbits without breaking breath. Pressure stays within Light-to-Medium range, expanding briefly into mid 10% depth when control holds steady. Record tactile feedback daily—how the walls respond, how fatigue surfaces, how breath sync feels. Endomorph bodies tend to fatigue through lumbar compression; offset that by slightly lifting the hips and redistributing weight forward into the forearms. Flow practice here is endurance training for your stabilizers. When rhythm becomes self-sustaining, you’re ready for depth precision.
Week four reintroduces the Deep Flow and Pinning components in short, contained intervals. After warming through shallow Flow, allow one controlled descent into mid 10% depth for three orbits, returning to shallow after each. Track your own emotional and physical steadiness. The goal is calm under intensity—maintaining smooth breath and spinal alignment while pressure rises. Follow with one Pinning sequence, holding stillness for three breaths at the edge of movement before releasing to neutral. This teaches the nervous system to recover instantly after climax, a key skill for multi-orgasmic control.
Every session ends in reflection. Sit back on your heels, breathe deeply, and let your awareness trace the line of energy from spine to hips to breath. Integration means no movement wasted, no reaction unconscious. You’re teaching your body to stay alert, calm, and aware even inside heat. The Egyptian Orbiting Circles becomes not a trick but an ecosystem—posture, breath, control, and empathy orbiting in harmony. Record one final journal note to seal the phase: “Full circuit sustained, 20 orbits, 80–10–10 maintained, calm closure@finish.”
Over time, this training engrains unshakable sensitivity and precision. Your body learns to translate pressure into pleasure and motion into meaning. She will remember that control long after the session ends—not because of size or strength, but because of timing and presence. This is the mark of mastery: the ability to circle her world without ever losing your own center. You have completed The Egyptian Orbiting Circles series.
