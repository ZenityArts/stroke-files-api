Module 1 for The Harrare is about setting up your body in the plank so the stroke has a safe, stable base. Think of this as building the ground floor before you try to play with the walls. Start in a forearm plank with your knees on the canvas, elbows under your shoulders, wrists loose, and your back long. Keep your hips low enough that the shaft stays aligned with her canal but not so low that your lower back caves. For a mesomorph, this means using your natural strength to lock in without over-tensing. At five to seven inches, you will not need to force depth, so keep the spine straight and let the angle of your hips decide how much wall you can reach. Always inhale to prepare in neutral, then exhale as you move, which keeps pressure from leaking into your shoulders and wrists. Neutral baseline is your reset point between every movement—forearms rooted, hips squared, weight balanced front to back.
Once baseline is steady, you begin to sense how depth works with your size. With five to seven inches, the sweet spot is shallow eighty percent, where the glans brushes the inner ridges and makes her body want to curl into you. The mid ten percent is available when she opens, but only in short passes, and the deep ten is not a priority—you guard cervix contact by keeping the hips forward but never slamming down. Medium pressure is your ceiling; mesomorph leverage gives you strength, but you must modulate it. Think of your hips like a steady pendulum—strong but never crashing. Light pressure can be used when her body is warming; hard pressure is rarely needed in this orientation. Anchor the breath: inhale to set, exhale through the sweep, inhale as you return to neutral, exhale again on the next action. This rhythm keeps the body from overloading and makes her cues easier to notice.
What she feels is clarity on her walls. With shallow strokes, she may sigh or exhale softly as the ridge of the glans drags along tissue. When you hold baseline correctly, her pelvis will often respond without you moving—hips tilt in, thighs tighten, or her breath deepens. These are your green lights. If she stills, she may be concentrating on sensation—do not rush. If her hips press into you, you may increase angle or pressure. Always track in SSP style: define what wall you are on, hypothesize whether she wants more or less, test the pressure, and refine. Your reflection each set is simple: Was her body opening more, or did it pull away? Adjust hips, angle, or tempo based on that.
The key metaphor here is to treat your plank like a compass needle. The more aligned you are in neutral, the easier it is to sweep and return without wobbling. For joint safety, mesomorphs need to watch shoulder loading. Do not sink into your elbows—spread weight across forearms and keep scapula active. For stamina, set rest hygiene by dropping hips to knees after twenty cycles, then reset back into plank.
A journal tag for this setup might read as one sentence: “Neutral plank, shallow eighty percent, medium pressure, hips level, deeper breath cue at cycle six.” This gives you a breadcrumb trail you can return to. If you notice wrists pinching or lower back arching, your adjustment is always to come back to neutral and rebuild baseline.

=================================================================================================


Module 2 for The Harrare teaches you to break the stroke down into its keystrokes and work them one by one until they feel natural in the body. Think of this stage as learning the alphabet before writing sentences—you are training building blocks that will later link into the full rhythm. Each keystroke starts and ends from a clean neutral forearm plank, and you always inhale to set, exhale through the action, then return to neutral before beginning the next. For a mesomorph with five to seven inches, the focus is not on forcing depth but on clarity of wall contact. Your size keeps you in the safe shallow eighty percent for most training, with occasional mid-ten passes, and posture protects stamina by spreading weight evenly across forearms and hips.
The first keystroke is the left-hip drop. From neutral plank, you slowly let the left hip sink toward the canvas. This is an angling action more than rocking, and it sends the head diagonally down-right so the glans rides along her right wall at the shallow band. Keep pressure at light-to-medium, exhaling as the hip lowers. She will feel a targeted brush on her inner ridge, which may cause her breath to deepen or her pelvis to rotate slightly toward the pressure. If her body stills, hold the angle a breath longer before resetting. As a mesomorph, avoid collapsing the shoulder when lowering the hip; let the forearms take the load evenly. With your length, this action will rarely exceed shallow depth, which is ideal for tracking cues.
The second keystroke is the right-hip join. While the left hip remains low, you allow the right hip to lower until both are close to the canvas. This transforms the angle into a sweep, turning the action into rocking across the floor of her canal until the head relocates near the north wall. Breath should exhale through the joining phase, pressure held at medium. She may respond with a soft pelvic curl upward when the ridge catches north. For a mesomorph, stability here comes from engaging the core to prevent over-rotation of the pelvis. With five to seven inches, you can reach the upper shallow zone without hitting cervix, but watch for her hips pulling back as a sign of too much northward drive.
The third keystroke is the right-hip lift back to neutral while the left hip stays down. This creates an angling sweep back across the canal, moving the glans right from north toward the right wall. Inhale to set, exhale to lift, medium pressure with clarity on the wall. She may press her hips into you as the ridge drags back across her right side, which is your signal that the angle is exact. For mesomorph control, keep the shoulders square even as the pelvis tilts. With your length, the sweep holds steady in shallow to mid, never pushing into deep ten. This keeps both safety and clarity.
The fourth keystroke is the reset lift, where the left hip rises to bring you back into neutral plank. This final sweep draws the head diagonally between her right wall and the south floor of the canal, clearing a path back to baseline. Pressure should ease to light, and the breath cycle closes with an inhale in neutral. What she feels here is a gentle brushing across a different angle, often provoking a soft exhale or letting go. Your cue is whether her body softens or arches to follow you back into place. For mesomorphs, the key is to use controlled hip strength rather than momentum, which keeps joints safe for high reps.
The mirror side of the stroke runs the same logic through the right-hip drop, left-hip join, left-hip lift, and full reset. Each keystroke maps opposite walls but uses the same Rocking and Angling balance, pressure bands, and breath anchors. Across all eight keystrokes, the training focus is clarity of motion, smooth resets, and reading her cues as green or yellow lights. A mesomorph body type must guard against rushing through because natural strength makes movement easy—slower is better for teaching the nervous system precision. At five to seven inches, all keystrokes should stay primarily shallow, teasing mid only when her body asks with pelvic tilt or hips pressing in.
A simple journal example might read, “Left drop, shallow right wall, light pressure, her hips pressed in at cycle three.” This records both your action and her response, which is the feedback loop you need for building mastery. Every keystroke ends back at neutral, so you never stack angles without a reset. This keeps stamina sustainable, protects joints, and trains the rhythm for later chaining.

=================================================================================================


Module 3 for The Harrare teaches you how to chain the keystrokes into a single stroke rhythm. Until now, you have been isolating each keystroke like a letter in the alphabet, but this module brings them together so the movements begin to feel like words and sentences. The goal is to build a natural sequence that flows from one keystroke to the next without losing control, always returning to neutral plank as your safe home base. For a mesomorph body with five to seven inches of length, this chaining must focus on clean angles, steady stamina, and safe joint load, with shallow dominance and only mid-depth flirtations when her cues invite it.
Begin by practicing the left-hip drop into the right-hip join without a pause between them. From neutral plank, inhale to prepare, then exhale as the left hip lowers and let the right hip follow directly, sweeping the glans from right wall to north wall in one breath cycle. She will often breathe deeper or tilt her pelvis forward when the north wall connection lands. As you rise back with the right-hip lift, keep the left hip grounded, letting the head sweep rightward, and then finish with the full reset lift. This four-keystroke loop forms one half of the Harrare. Pause in neutral for a breath, then mirror the sequence to the right side, chaining drop, join, lift, and reset into a complete eight-step cycle. Inhale resets, exhale sweeps, with pressure modulated light-to-medium throughout. Never chase deep pressure here; your five to seven inches already offer enough clarity to strike walls without excess force.
The chaining will feel awkward at first, but repetition smooths it into rhythm. Think of it like a pendulum: hips drop and join on one side, then lift and reset on the way back, always returning to neutral before switching sides. As you build continuity, resist the urge to rush. A mesomorph body type can overpower the tempo, but mastery comes from keeping angles exact and pressure controlled. Watch for cues—her breath catching, her hips curling, her pelvis pressing into you. If she goes still, that is often her way of saying stay right there. Adjust tempo, angle, or depth in response, but never skip the neutral reset that protects joints and stamina.
Over time, your nervous system adapts, letting you shift from thinking about keystrokes to feeling them. That is the neural-plastic progression: isolate, chain, and then flow. At this stage you are not yet holding long rhythms, but you are teaching your body the order of operations. Journaling helps capture clarity: “Left drop to right join, shallow right wall to north, medium pressure, her exhale on reset.” This single line tells you what you did and how she reacted, which sharpens tracking in the next phase.

=================================================================================================
Module 4 for The Harrare is where you enter the first structured Tracking phase. Your focus now is not to flow, but to run short, deliberate test sets in the shallow eighty percent zone. You are using SSP: define a hypothesis, observe her cues, record, and refine. In plank, begin each set from neutral. On an inhale, prepare your hips, and on the exhale, perform one keystroke chain—such as the left-hip drop to right-hip join. Keep pressure light to medium so you can feel the walls without overwhelming her. After two to three cycles, pause in neutral, reset your breath, and reflect before starting again.
The shallow zone is your laboratory. With five to seven inches of length, you have enough reach to brush the mid ten percent when she allows, but most of your data comes from the shallow walls where her nerve endings are dense. As a mesomorph, your natural power must be harnessed. Do not press harder just because you can. Instead, use the angles to test sensitivity. For example, run a set targeting the right wall, then switch to the north wall, then to the left wall. Each time, watch for clear partner cues: a deeper inhale, a pelvic tilt, or her hips pressing into you. Those are signals you are striking resonance. If her body goes quiet, note it—it may mean the angle missed or the pressure was off.
After each set, capture your impressions quickly. A single line in your journal is enough: “North wall shallow, light pressure, hips curled on rep three.” That sentence gives you feedback you can test again. The more cycles you run, the more patterns emerge. The SSP loop depends on your discipline—observe, tweak, test. If she responds strongly to a certain wall, repeat it. If she stays neutral, change the angle or adjust pressure. Your goal is not pleasure maximization yet but data collection, so you can move into Flow with confidence later.
The key here is patience. Resist the urge to chase orgasm or flow too early. Tracking is where you build the map of her canal under your stroke. Think of it as tuning an instrument before playing a song. By refining your awareness now, you make Flow effortless in the next module. Keep resets strict, hips aligned, and pressure bands clear. With your body type, overextension can load your lower back, so always return to neutral plank to protect your joints. Use breath cycles as your metronome and do not exceed five cycles without a reset.

=================================================================================================


Module 5 for The Harrare is your entry into Flow. At this stage, you take the keystrokes you mapped in Tracking and string them into a rhythm that can sustain her pleasure without constant adjustment. Flow is where discipline in resets pays off. Begin again in neutral plank, forearms firm, hips aligned. Inhale to settle, then exhale into a smooth chain such as the left hip drop, the sweep across to north, and the return to baseline. This time you do not pause after every two or three reps—you allow cycles to stack until the rhythm itself carries you forward.
The shallow zone remains your foundation. Eighty percent of your time should stay here, brushing the side and north walls where her sensory net is most alive. With five to seven inches of length, you are able to flirt with the mid zone, especially if she curls her hips or lifts into you. When that happens, allow the stroke to deepen slightly on an exhale, but only for one or two strokes before returning shallow. This keeps her body safe and the cervix unpressed. Flow requires pressure discipline: light to medium in shallow, medium only when skimming mid. Hard pressure belongs nowhere in this phase. Watch her cues closely—when her breath syncs with yours or when her pelvis rises to meet the sweep, you know the rhythm is landing.
As a mesomorph, your strength makes sustaining tempo easy, but this also tempts you to overdrive. Flow is not about power. It is about smoothness. Imagine gliding a paintbrush along a curved wall—too much force and the line blurs, just enough and the stroke sings. Protect your lower back and hips by never holding tension past five breaths. Every fifth or sixth cycle, exhale back to neutral plank, reset, and inhale into the next run. This cadence prevents fatigue and keeps your alignment clean. Flow should feel like an effortless rolling wave, not a struggle.
She will show you Flow’s success in her stillness. When the right wall or diagonal lands, she may stop moving except for her breath, as if her body is listening. When the rhythm fits, her pelvis presses back automatically, no thought needed. Stay tuned to that language. If the rhythm falters and she shifts or adjusts, return to baseline and restart. Flow is fragile at first, but once you lock into it, her body will carry you, guiding where pressure, angle, and tempo belong.
Your journal can now track rhythm integrity instead of single keystrokes. A simple entry might read: “Five-cycle run right-to-north sweep, shallow medium, hips lifted on cycle three, flow held until reset.” These notes help you spot which sequences sustain resonance. Flow is the proof that your Tracking was sound. Without the discipline of the earlier modules, Flow collapses into guesswork. With it, Flow becomes the living pulse of The Harrare.

=================================================================================================


Module 6 for The Harrare is about expanding into the mid and deep zones with discipline, so you can give her the intensity of depth without ever crossing into harm. Begin again from your neutral forearm-plank baseline, spine aligned, hips steady, inhale to prepare. On your exhale, allow the stroke to carry just a little deeper than the shallow 80% you’ve trained. With a penis length of five to seven inches, you can safely reach into the mid 10% when she signals readiness—her hips curling in, breath thickening, or a deeper exhale that invites you further. These cues are your green light. Without them, you remain shallow.
Depth demands clarity. When you drop your hip and sweep across her canal, let the pressure rise from medium into firm but never hard. Think of pressing into clay—you want to leave an impression, not break through. This is Angling with a hint of Rocking, and the contact shifts from side wall to north with a fuller body behind it. Because you are mesomorphic, your frame can drive this easily, but that power must be rationed. Count your breaths—three to four at mid depth, then reset to shallow for safety. Never linger in deep zones without her showing sustained cues like hips pulling you in or stillness anchoring the moment.
The cervix is your hard boundary. Even with five to seven inches, it is possible to collide if she withdraws or if you push without awareness. That is why mid-depth strokes must always begin shallow and roll inward, never jam straight down. Use exhale as your guide—if breath and motion end together, depth remains under control. Inhale back to neutral, re-center, and begin again. If she tenses or shifts away, it means the angle is too steep or pressure too much. Adjust by softening to light pressure, easing the diagonal, or resetting to shallow before reattempting. Flow is maintained not by depth alone but by matching depth to her body’s allowance.
What she feels in these moments is a fuller stretch, a denser pressure on walls that seemed thinner at shallow. Done correctly, her body often responds with a low moan, a pelvic draw, or a long pause in movement. This is her nervous system registering the weight of depth. Your task is not to flood her with it but to offer it in controlled doses, returning often to the safety of shallow. In this way, you create contrast—the sweetness of surface, the surge of depth, the return to lightness. That variation amplifies arousal and builds trust.
A simple journal reflection for this module might read: “North wall sweep, mid depth on exhale, medium-firm pressure, hips pulled in on second rep.” These short notations keep you honest about when and how you went deep, and what her cues said in response. Over time, this teaches you to refine the ratio of shallow to mid without losing rhythm integrity.

=================================================================================================


Module 7 for The Harrare is where you learn to pin her arousal after orgasm and guide her into multiples by using controlled micro-adjustments. Start again from neutral forearm plank, shoulders stacked, hips steady, inhale to prepare. On your exhale, sink into shallow 80% with light-to-medium pressure. This is not about driving deep—it is about holding her in place while her body recovers and then reopens. Think of it as setting a weight gently on her nervous system, enough to be felt, not enough to overwhelm.
From that anchored base, use Angling more than Rocking. Drop a single hip by a finger’s width and let the head sweep across a wall slowly. This micro-shift presses into either east or west shallow while maintaining steadiness against the south. It should feel to her like a pulse of firmness rather than a thrust. Her cues here are subtle: hips curling in, her body stilling, or a long exhale. These tell you the pin is holding. If she pulls away or her breath becomes shallow and fast, ease off to lighter pressure, reset to neutral, and let her body choose again. Always exhale through the adjustment and inhale to reset.
Mesomorphic leverage can easily overpower here, so restraint is key. Stay shallow and firm, rarely rising above medium pressure. With a five-to-seven-inch length, you have just enough to explore mid when her hips invite, but you must return shallow often to prevent cervix contact while she is vulnerable in post-orgasmic sensitivity. Stamina is preserved by using breath anchors—exhale through action, inhale to reset—so that you never hold tension in your lower back or wrists. Pinning is less about power and more about rhythm integrity and micro-control.
What she feels during this module is safety and inevitability. The weight of your presence keeps her anchored while the angle shifts tease her body back into arousal. Done correctly, this is the moment when multiples become available—her hips press in despite fatigue, her breath deepens again, and she draws you in rather than pushing you away. Journal it simply: “South-east pin, shallow, light pressure, hips stilled on third breath.” Over time, these notes show you which walls and pressures reignite her most reliably.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for The Harrare with Body Type Mesomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=================================================================================================
Module 8 for The Harrare is where you integrate everything into a four-week training arc. By now you understand your neutral forearm plank, the keystrokes that build the motion, and how your mesomorphic leverage with a five-to-seven-inch length changes what walls you emphasize. This plan is less about adding new mechanics and more about weaving all of them together until they run without thought. Think of it like rehearsing a song: each week you add tempo, layering keystrokes, refining breath, and testing flow without skipping the resets.
In your first week, stay mostly in shallow 80%, keeping pressure light to medium. Practice sets of short runs where you reset to neutral every four to six breaths, letting your body memorize alignment. Journal notes after each session, even if only a single line about which wall gave you clearest contact. The second week is when you let the keystrokes start linking. Work east-north-west arcs with smooth angling, exhaling through each sweep and inhaling back to baseline. Avoid forcing mid depth until her cues show readiness. Your mesomorphic build gives you power, so trust the breath anchors to manage stamina and joint load.
By the third week, the goal is to sustain flow across walls while staying conscious of pressure ceilings. This is where you train rhythm endurance, holding shallow engagement for full breath cycles without collapsing posture. When her hips curl in or her breath deepens, mark it in your journal simply: “West sweep, shallow, medium pressure, hips pressed at rep five.” This repetition trains you to track cause and effect. In the fourth week, begin layering pinning strategies. After shallow flow, drop to neutral, then angle a hip and hold a wall lightly while she recovers. Wait for her body to invite the next entry. This is the preparation for multiples.
Throughout all four weeks, rest hygiene is essential. Your mesomorphic frame allows strong holds, but wrists and lower back must never carry more than they can recover from. Between sessions, deload by stretching hips and shoulders, and give at least a day between heavy sets. Over time, this plan builds not only stamina and precision but also the ability to enter flow states at will. You will know you are ready when the stroke no longer feels like a sequence but like a single living rhythm carried by breath and reset.
