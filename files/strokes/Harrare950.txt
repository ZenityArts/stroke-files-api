Module 1 for The Harrare begins by setting your foundation. The purpose is to teach you how to hold your body in forearm-plank posture so you can manage joint load, control depth, and find a safe baseline that lets the stroke build cleanly over time. Without this baseline, the stroke falls apart under pressure, so the goal here is to anchor posture, breath, and wall awareness before anything else.
Start in a forearm-plank on the mattress with your weight balanced across elbows and toes. For a mesomorph, this posture is natural because you carry solid muscle mass, but that strength can trick you into leaning too heavy through your shoulders. Keep the line from shoulder to elbow straight, and shift some of your load into your core. Breathe into your belly, then exhale to settle. Each time you come back to this baseline, you should feel like the room resets—neutral spine, relaxed throat, and your pelvis floating free instead of dragging. With a penis above seven inches, the temptation is to drive deep right away, but the baseline posture is your brake system. It allows you to stay in the shallow 80% where tracking and learning actually happen.
Now focus on depth control from this plank. With size above seven inches, every push risks hitting the cervix unless you gate the movement carefully. In baseline, tilt your pelvis just enough to feel the crown at her opening without pushing inside. Think of this like resting a key against a lock before turning it. You hold Light pressure on the shallow wall, inhaling to prepare and exhaling to let the weight settle. Your muscles should feel alive but not straining. This gives you wall clarity: you’ll know whether you are working the top, bottom, left, or right diagonal without confusion. If you feel jammed or if her breath catches sharply, you’ve skipped the baseline reset and forced past depth. Return to plank, breathe, and reset again.
Joint load must stay distributed. Mesomorph frames can carry tension in hips and lower back. If your pelvis starts to sag, you’ll collapse weight into her body and lose the sensitivity that makes The Harrare powerful. Keep glutes lightly engaged to support your lumbar spine. Imagine your pelvis as a steady hinge—never slamming, never sagging. This keeps pressure in the Light to Medium range unless you deliberately escalate. Journal one shorthand line after practice, like: “Baseline held, bottom wall shallow @10 reps.” Over time, these quick notes will tell you when your plank posture fails or when you’ve mastered control.
When you hold neutral plank with steady breath, shallow crown placement, and Light pressure clarity, you’ve set the table for the stroke to live inside the 80–10–10 rule. This baseline makes every keystroke sharper later, protects her from discomfort, and keeps your body ready to endure. With posture clean and baseline ingrained, you can move into keystroke training with precision.

Module 2 for The Harrare moves you from the foundation of posture into the building blocks of movement. This is where you identify and isolate the keystrokes that make up the stroke so you can train them as separate pieces before chaining them together. Think of each keystroke like a note on an instrument: simple on its own, but capable of creating rhythm and intensity when combined.
The first keystroke for The Harrare is a shallow forward Rock. From your forearm-plank baseline, inhale to prepare, then exhale as you glide the crown along the bottom wall inside the shallow 80%. With your above-seven-inch length, keep the range short—no more than the front third—so you don’t skip zones or crash into depth. This Rock teaches you to control light penetration pressure, using your pelvis as the driver rather than your lower back. You’ll feel her pelvic floor give you a soft resistance if you are aligned correctly, and her hips may curl slightly as feedback. Journal it simply as “Bottom Rock shallow, Light @12 reps.”
The second keystroke is the angled press along the right diagonal. This one is more of an Angling motion than a Rock. From baseline, you tilt your pelvis slightly right as you move forward, guiding the shaft toward her inner right wall. Keep pressure in the Medium band and restrict yourself to shallow 80% unless her breath deepens and hips pull you in. For a mesomorph frame, watch joint load: don’t twist from your shoulders, but angle from your pelvis. With your size, you must respect the gate—too much angle with depth risks discomfort. Inhale to set, exhale to press, then return to neutral plank.
The third keystroke is the upward Rock toward the top wall. This is Light-to-Medium pressure, shallow again, focusing on broad glides that trace the ceiling of her canal. Think of this like painting a line across the roof. With above-seven-inch length, you’ll naturally reach the sensitive arc at the top with very little drive. Keep rhythm steady, matching her breath, and avoid letting your core sag, which would dump weight into her. Journal it as “Top Rock, shallow @8 reps.”
Each of these keystrokes—bottom Rock, right diagonal angle, top Rock—should be trained separately before any chaining. Always return to forearm-plank neutral to reset. Inhale before action, exhale through motion, then reset again. The clarity you earn in isolation will make the stroke precise later, and for your body type and size, these resets also protect your joints and keep you from overshooting depth. She will show cues—breath deepening, hips pressing in, a pause of stillness—that tell you when one keystroke hits correctly. These cues are your tracking signals for the SSP loop that comes later.

=========================================================================================================


Module 3 for The Harrare is where the isolated keystrokes you have trained begin to flow into a single rhythm. Orientation and isolation gave you precision; now you need to chain them into the complete stroke logic. Think of this as stringing beads together—each keystroke is distinct, but the necklace only forms when they connect in sequence.
Start in a forearm-plank neutral baseline. Inhale to prepare, exhale as you drive the shallow bottom Rock forward, tracing the floor of her canal. Return to baseline, inhale again, then tilt your pelvis right and exhale as you angle into the right diagonal press. Reset fully, inhale, and use the next exhale to glide into the top Rock, tracing the roof shallow. Every time you complete one keystroke, you must reset the baseline before beginning the next—this keeps your mesomorph frame supported and ensures clarity of wall contact. Without these resets, you risk bleeding movements together and losing the precision that makes her body react.
Once the isolated pieces are reliable, you can begin chaining two at a time. Bottom Rock into right diagonal angle, right diagonal into top Rock, top Rock back into bottom Rock. Each connection should follow a simple breath rhythm: inhale at reset, exhale through action, inhale again before the next. The exhale anchors pressure and prevents you from driving too deep with your above-seven-inch length. Staying shallow through most of these reps keeps you in the 80% safe zone, which is where her body shows the clearest cues. Look for her hips to press in during the diagonal, her breath to deepen during the top Rock, or a small pelvic curl during the bottom Rock. These are signs you are landing on target.
As chaining develops, slow your pace until the stroke logic feels like a loop, not separate notes. Each movement is distinct but flows into the next, always returning to neutral. You are training your nervous system to feel the canal as a compass map, not just as a tunnel. This is how the stroke becomes repeatable without thought later. With your body type, resist the urge to muscle the sequence. Keep your shoulders stacked over elbows, spine neutral, and core lightly braced. With your size, avoid pushing into the mid or deep 10% until Module 6 explicitly allows it. This protects her cervix and your stamina. Journal one cycle simply as “Bottom–Right–Top, shallow, Medium @6 reps.”

=========================================================================================================


Module 4 for The Harrare now shifts into the Tracking phase, where your job is to test the shallow 80% range with discipline. This is where SSP begins in full: you define a clear hypothesis, test it with a mini-set, watch for her cues, and refine. The plank posture and breath anchors you trained in Modules 1–3 are what let you stay precise while her body gives you feedback.
Begin from the forearm-plank neutral baseline. Inhale to set, exhale as you drive into the bottom Rock shallow, keeping pressure Medium so the head of your length glides the lower canal floor. Reset, then repeat, but this time extend slightly longer on the exhale to test if her hips follow in or her breath deepens. Journal one cycle in prose: “South wall, shallow, Medium, hips pressed in at rep three.” That is a complete SSP loop—defined action, observed cue, written record.
Shift to the diagonal angle next. Inhale at reset, exhale as you tilt the pelvis right and let the shaft glide along the east diagonal wall, still shallow. Here you are testing how her body reacts when the wall is touched at a slant rather than straight-on. With your above-seven-inch length, avoid chasing depth; the goal is clarity at the surface. A pelvic curl or her body stilling are signs you landed correctly. If cues are faint, refine by softening pressure to Light or by shortening the exhale so the stroke becomes quicker.
Use the top Rock to test the north wall. Inhale at reset, exhale through the glide, keeping it controlled and light. Because of your mesomorph build, you can generate force easily, but here force clouds the signal. The shallow north wall should make her breathing change subtly—if she exhales softly or arches slightly, log that response. A journal entry might read: “North wall, shallow, Light, soft exhale at rep four.” Each note builds a map of what walls are most reactive for her.
The Tracking phase is not about performance, it is about data. Three or four mini-sets per wall, each tracked with breath anchors, is enough. You refine not by chasing harder strokes but by adjusting angle, pressure, or tempo until her body gives you a clear yes. That is the signal you carry forward into Flow. Remember, your length means you must stay disciplined at the surface until her cues explicitly invite depth.

=========================================================================================================






Module 5 for The Harrare now moves you into Flow. This is where the shallow tracking work you logged becomes rhythm. You are no longer testing mini-sets but sustaining a continuous groove that she can ride without breaks. The task is to take the wall that gave you the clearest response in Module 4 and build a looping cycle anchored by breath and baseline resets.
Begin from the forearm-plank neutral. Inhale steady, exhale as you rock into the chosen wall shallow. Because your length is above seven inches, the shallow eighty percent is your safest and sharpest range—this is where the head paints the wall with clarity while avoiding overload at depth. Use Medium pressure as your default; Light when you sense her breathing tighten, Hard only in short bursts when her hips press in with demand. The mesomorph frame means your core is strong enough to hold a long Flow, but stamina depends on not oversqueezing the glutes—let the hips roll rather than drive.
When Flow is steady, let the diagonal keystrokes enter the cycle. From neutral, exhale and tilt the pelvis to sweep east, then reset and sweep west. These diagonal Angling motions stir her edges, giving contrast without breaking rhythm. With your size, depth gating matters—keep the head grazing surface lines rather than plunging. Her cue is usually a stilling body or a subtle pelvic curl; if you feel that, maintain the diagonal until her breath opens. Journal one run in a single sentence: “East diagonal, shallow, Medium, pelvic curl at rep five.”
As Flow builds, you can expand the loop to include the north wall rock, provided her cues invite it. Exhale into the top wall, hold pressure Light to Medium, then return baseline. Watch carefully—if she arches or exhales softly, that’s your signal to sustain. If she stiffens, gate the depth back down. The Flow must feel like waves—inhale at reset, exhale through each pass, with the rhythm steady enough that her body entrains to it.
This module’s goal is clarity without overreach. Flow at shallow depth is what lets her body entrust itself to the rhythm, and that trust is the foundation for mid or deep options later. You carry the discipline of tracking forward, but now the movement is continuous, her cues are matched rather than tested, and your baseline holds the entire groove together.

=========================================================================================================






Module 6 for The Harrare is where you test the deep option. The purpose is not to chase depth for its own sake, but to open controlled access to the mid and deep ten percent zones only when her body makes space. You are building on the shallow Flow you held in Module 5 and adding vertical control.
Start in forearm plank, steady and neutral. Inhale to prepare, exhale as you guide the pelvis forward, angling just enough for the head to touch mid-depth. Because your length is above seven inches, the margin is small. Your first passes should stay at the edge of mid depth—any deeper too quickly risks collision with the cervix. Use Light pressure on entry, then Medium if her hips curl toward you or her breath softens. If she stiffens or pulls back, gate immediately to shallow. The mesomorph body helps you hold plank with steady core drive, but you must guard against over-leverage; keep the push rolling from the hips rather than thrusting from the lower back.
The north wall is usually the best entry point for depth. Exhale into it slowly, let the head glide under the top ridge, then return baseline. If her cue is an open sigh or stilling at the waist, you can maintain short cycles in this zone. South wall can be riskier with your size, so only test it in small angles. Think of it like pushing a door open slowly—pressure builds only if there is give.
Diagonal sweeps into mid-depth give variety. From baseline, inhale, then exhale as you tilt east, holding shallow for one count and dipping mid for one count. Reset. The effect is a double contrast: the shallow brush keeps her safe, the mid dip adds intensity. She may answer with hips pressing in or a firmer pelvic roll. Journal with simple shorthand, for example: “North mid, Light pressure, soft sigh at rep three.”
Deep ten percent is a privilege, not a right. With your length, full deep is only possible if she is fully aroused, lubricated, and signaling with strong pull-ins. If you feel resistance or sharp stillness, you must not force it. Instead, linger shallow until she opens again. The breath anchor keeps you disciplined—inhale on reset, exhale only as you go deeper, never the reverse.
This module’s lesson is that depth is about invitation. You must let her body grant access and only then apply calibrated pressure. When done right, the deep option doesn’t just intensify the stroke—it makes the shallow Flow richer because contrast heightens sensation.

=========================================================================================================




Module 7 for The Harrare is the pinning strategy that follows orgasm. The aim is to extend her arousal into multiples by making small adjustments while holding her in place rather than driving a new rhythm.
From the neutral forearm plank, keep your weight balanced across shoulders and hips. After orgasm, stay shallow at eighty percent and let your breathing guide the pace. Inhale through reset, exhale through small angled dips. Instead of long strokes, shorten the range to half-inch sweeps. Angle slightly east or west as you exhale, then return to baseline. These are Rocking moves more than thrusts, and the Angling effect is what pins her against a chosen wall. The mesomorph frame helps keep the plank steady, but do not over-engage the lower back; let your core absorb the load so your hips can make crisp micro-angles without fatigue.
With length above seven inches, the goal is to control penetration depth tightly so the head never slams cervix post-orgasm. The safe zone is shallow to mid—deeper only if she actively curls hips or presses down into you. Her cues here are subtle: a stilling body, a sudden long exhale, or a small pelvic curl. When you see these, tweak the angle or pressure, then test it with two or three controlled cycles. If she stays open, continue. If she stiffens or pulls away, return to neutral shallow and reset the breath.
This Observe–Tweak–Test loop is the SSP for pinning. Each adjustment is small enough to feel distinct but not overwhelming. For example, exhale as you angle east with Medium pressure, then reset on inhale. If her breath deepens or she clutches, repeat. If not, switch to a west angle or drop pressure lighter. The contrast keeps the nerve endings awake and allows her to climb again. Journal examples help you stay sharp, such as: “West shallow, Medium, hips pressed in, new moan at rep five.”
The reflection after each mini-burst matters as much as the stroke itself. Pause in baseline, rest on your breath, and feel her cues. She may melt into stillness, which means hold that spot lightly. She may grip tighter, which means continue micro-movements. The pinning phase is a conversation at her edge, not a new rhythm.
When done correctly, this strategy does not just extend her orgasm—it creates the possibility for waves. Your steadiness, your angle changes, and your breath discipline are what turn a single release into a sequence she cannot forget.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for The Harrare with Body Type Mesomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


=========================================================================================================
Module 8 for The Harrare is your training and integration plan. It sets the rhythm for how you build this stroke into your body until it becomes second nature.
Start by keeping your practice centered on the forearm-plank baseline. This posture is the foundation that protects your joints and makes wall clarity possible. In your first week, train short sessions focusing on the hip-drop and angle resets in shallow range, staying disciplined with breath anchors. Think of it as carving grooves into your nervous system. Inhale on reset, exhale on the drop, then return. This repetition builds both stamina and control, especially important with above-seven-inch length where depth must be carefully gated.
By the second week, link the keystrokes together in slow rhythm cycles. Keep them shallow, eighty percent, and let the sequence flow across the compass walls as written in the stroke logic. Use breath to steady your tempo. Journal daily in one clear line, such as, “Right wall sweep, shallow, Medium, hips curled in at cycle six.” The aim here is clarity of feel rather than intensity.
Week three is where you begin to explore Flow. Extend each cycle longer, let rhythm settle, and watch her cues more closely. If she breathes deeper, presses her hips, or curls toward you, hold that angle longer before resetting. If she stiffens or pulls, return to shallow and lighten pressure. This is your SSP in practice—observe, adjust, test. For mesomorph frames, this is where endurance pays off: you can sustain the plank without collapsing posture, but remember to rest shoulders and wrists between sets.
In the final week, add Pinning practice. After a simulated climax point in your set, switch into micro-angle sweeps and observe how quickly her body reopens to rhythm. These are short bursts, followed by stillness, then back into baseline. The rhythm is not about speed but about how precisely you can pin her attention to one wall or one angle. With your length, stay shallow and mid; save deep zones only for when she asks for it with clear cues.
Across all weeks, rest hygiene matters. Give yourself neutral pauses every twenty cycles, check in with your breath, and make sure your spine and shoulders stay aligned. A mesomorph frame can sometimes power through fatigue, but the long-term mastery comes from protecting your structure. Always remember that discipline at shallow depth unlocks safe expansion later.
By the end of this plan, The Harrare should feel less like a set of movements and more like a natural rhythm that belongs to your body. The compass will no longer be mental—it will be felt in your hips, in her cues, and in the breath that guides both of you.
