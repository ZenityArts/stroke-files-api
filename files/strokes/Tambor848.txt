Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Tambor Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to work with you on this program specifically designed for endomorphs with an extension below 5 inches. Your body is a powerhouse—a robust, full‑figured frame that’s built for strength, endurance, and unyielding stability. Even though your asset is compact, every inch is incredibly sensitive when used with the proper technique, and your natural mass allows you to deliver impressive, cumulative stimulation when you channel that power correctly. Today, we’re going to learn how to transform your inherent strength into a carefully controlled Tambor Stroke that combines a deliberate forward push with rapid, precise hip rotations, all tailored to your unique build.
Picture yourself stepping into your personal training space—a quiet, dedicated sanctuary where all distractions melt away. Feel the unwavering support of the floor beneath your feet; it reflects the stability of your endomorphic frame. Take several deep, controlled breaths; with each inhale, fill your body with focused energy, and with each exhale, release any tension. This space is your arena, brother—a place where you convert raw, substantial power into a meticulously choreographed performance that delivers balanced, cumulative pleasure.
We start by modifying the classic missionary position to suit your powerful, full‑figured build. Begin in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a sturdy surface designed to support your mass. This foundational stance anchors your entire body so that every micro‑movement—from the subtle swaying of your hips to the dynamic, rapid rotations—is executed with deliberate precision. Your natural endurance and solid build ensure that every movement is controlled, directing your significant force precisely to where it yields maximum stimulation without overwhelming her delicate nerve‑rich areas.
Once you’re securely anchored, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Think of this deliberate insertion as your blueprint—it sets the exact angles and pressure points that will guide every subsequent move in your Tambor Stroke. Your journey begins with a smooth, deliberate forward push. As you drive your body forward toward your partner’s head, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide gently over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, purposeful contact with her “south wall.” Because your asset is below 5 inches, the 80‑10‑10 principle requires that approximately 80% of your force be focused on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), with the remaining 20% evenly distributed between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This balanced force allocation sets the stage for cumulative stimulation.
After that forward push, you transition into the signature phase of the Tambor Stroke. Here, you decide whether to operate in “Tambor going right” or “Tambor going left.” In Tambor going right, you perform fast‑paced hip rotations to the right. As you rotate, the hilt of your penis rapidly canvasses the vaginal opening from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment, while the head swiftly points toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall. In Tambor going left, the process is mirrored: the hilt canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head points first toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. These rapid, dynamic rotations are designed to harness your robust power and deliver rapid cumulative stimulation, even with a compact extension. With your sturdy endomorphic frame supporting you, every fast-paced rotation becomes a controlled burst of cumulative pleasure.
This introduction lays the foundation, brother. It shows you how to set up your training environment, establish the correct posture, and channel your robust, full‑figured power along with your compact extension into a Tambor Stroke that converts raw strength into a finely tuned performance of cumulative stimulation. Welcome, brother—today we begin turning your natural potential into a true masterpiece of intimate art.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Alright, brother, let’s break down the technical framework that powers your Tambor Stroke—where scientific precision meets the art of intimate movement, ensuring every motion you make is deliberate, cumulative, and balanced.
First off, the 80‑10‑10 principle is your force‑distribution blueprint. Picture this: about 80% of the force you generate is directed to the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because that area has the densest concentration of nerve endings, making it extremely sensitive. The remaining 20% of your force is split evenly, with 10% targeting the mid‑depth zone (roughly 3 to 5 inches) and 10% directed to the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an endomorph with a compact extension below 5 inches, this distribution is crucial. Your powerful, full‑figured frame naturally produces significant force, so you must channel most of that power to the ultra-sensitive shallow area while still delivering a balanced, cumulative touch deeper inside. This method is key to building stimulation that’s both intense and evenly distributed.
Next, we explore the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic, iterative method for refining your technique. It begins with clearly defining your goal; for example, you may aim to maximize the dynamic intensity of your fast-paced hip rotations in the Tambor Stroke. Once your goal is set, you form a hypothesis—maybe you suspect that a slightly quicker rotation or a specific adjustment in angle will enhance cumulative stimulation. Then comes tracking. In the tracking phase, you perform around 30 repetitions for each directional movement, closely monitoring your body’s cues (engaging your robust core and pelvic floor) and, most importantly, listening to your partner’s responses. Notice her deep, rhythmic breathing, observe subtle posture changes, and catch any soft verbal cues that indicate which aspects of your stroke are most effective. Tracking serves as your immediate feedback loop, allowing you to make real-time adjustments for maximum cumulative effect.
After tracking has provided sufficient feedback, you enter a state of flow—an almost magical condition where every micro‑movement, from your smooth forward push to your rapid hip rotations, occurs seamlessly and automatically, as if choreographed perfectly. In flow, you no longer consciously control each movement; your body instinctively delivers the exact pressure and timing refined through tracking, allowing cumulative stimulation to build effortlessly with each repetition.
Lastly, let’s discuss the tap keystroke drill—a fundamental exercise for honing your lateral precision. Picture yourself in a solid forearm plank; then slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, and return smoothly to center. Though it might look like a simple movement, this drill builds essential muscle memory and pelvic strength, ensuring every lateral shift is executed with pinpoint accuracy. When combined with deep, controlled “stroke breathing” and integrated with kegeling exercises, the tap keystroke drill ensures each lateral move adheres perfectly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
In summary, brother: the 80‑10‑10 principle ensures 80% of your force is applied to the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone while the remaining 20% is evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep layers; the Sexual Scientific Process—through goal-setting, hypothesis formation, rigorous tracking, and the ensuing state of flow—helps you refine your technique continuously; and the tap keystroke drill develops the lateral precision essential for cumulative stimulation. With these core principles established, you’re fully equipped to break down and master the Tambor Stroke with scientific precision.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Tambor Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Tambor Stroke step by step to create a detailed roadmap that transforms your raw power into rapid, cumulative stimulation. You perform the Tambor Stroke in the classic missionary position—with you on top, in a modified plank (knees on the canvas), and your penis inserted at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Once you’re inserted, you choose your directional mode: you operate “Tambor going right” or “Tambor going left,” and each mode uses fast-paced hip rotations to generate rapid, cumulative stimulation.
Start with the foundation: the forward push. From your anchored position, drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head with a smooth, deliberate push. Feel the top shelf of your extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, focused contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is below 5 inches, the 80‑10‑10 principle instructs you to focus around 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), with the remaining 20% evenly allocated to the mid‑depth and deep areas. This forward push establishes the cumulative base for your stroke.
Next comes the directional phase. In “Tambor going right,” you perform fast-paced hip rotations to the right. As you rotate rapidly, the hilt of your penis applies pressure by canvassing the vaginal opening from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment. Simultaneously, the head quickly points toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall, delivering dynamic, rapid stimulation that builds cumulatively. Conversely, in “Tambor going left,” the process is mirrored: the hilt applies pressure by canvassing from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head first points toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. These rapid rotations are designed to capitalize on your natural ectomorphic agility, ensuring that cumulative stimulation is built quickly and precisely despite your compact extension.
Training the Tambor Stroke means isolating each keystroke and drilling them until they become second nature. Begin with the forward push drill—practice it until you achieve a smooth, controlled, and consistent motion. Then, isolate the fast-paced hip rotations. Drill the “going right” rotations, focusing on executing them rapidly with the hilt canvassing correctly (from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment) and the head shifting precisely (from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall). Next, practice the “going left” rotations with equal precision. Alternate these drills until you can execute each rapid movement while steadfastly following the 80‑10‑10 force distribution.
Each keystroke—from your deliberate forward push to every rapid hip rotation—is a building block of the Tambor Stroke. Breaking it down into these precise components gives you a clear, step-by-step roadmap that transforms your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension into a finely choreographed performance that delivers cumulative, rapid stimulation with exact control.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each individual element of the Tambor Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with flawless speed and precision. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you’re built for rapid, explosive moves—but every fast-paced rotation must be controlled with laser accuracy. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and drill it repeatedly until it’s firmly ingrained in your muscle memory, while always adhering strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle and using the correct hip rotation details.
Begin with the forward push drill. In your modified missionary position, with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that supports your lean frame, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly execute a forward push toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation—the top shelf of your extension should glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Since your extension is compact, direct about 80% of your force to the shallow, sensitive zone. Repeat this drill slowly and methodically until the forward push is perfectly smooth and consistent.
Next, move on to the lateral shift drills. Start with a right lateral shift. From your forward push position, slowly shift your entire body to the right in a deliberate, controlled manner. Concentrate on even weight transfer; feel your hilt apply steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates to deliver broad, rhythmic pressure toward her left wall. As you execute this shift, integrate the correct hip rotations—perform 2 slow rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment and the head transitions from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. Drill this movement repeatedly until it becomes second nature.
Then, practice a left lateral shift drill. Slowly shift your body to the left—feel your hilt maintain consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates to deliver broad pressure toward her right wall. During this left shift, perform 2 slow hip rotations with the hilt canvassing from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and the head moving from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall. Alternate these lateral drills until you can effortlessly transition between right and left with the 80‑10‑10 distribution intact.
Now, add the “double down” element to intensify the stimulation. On the right side, after completing a standard right shift, lower your body further in a controlled, deliberate manner to perform a right double down. Focus on amplifying the pressure—feel the hilt deliver additional, concentrated force to the right side while your shaft continues its broad, rhythmic massage toward her left wall. Drill this double down slowly until you achieve complete control over the extra force. Then mirror the process on the left side—execute a left shift followed by a left double down, ensuring cumulative stimulation is applied evenly. Aim for at least 30 repetitions per drill until every micro‑movement is securely ingrained in your muscle memory.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing. Each deep inhale fuels the next precise movement, and every deliberate exhale ensures smooth transitions between drills. Additionally, incorporate the tap keystroke drill: assume a stable forearm plank, then slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, and return to center. This drill sharpens your lateral precision and guarantees that every movement adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle with flawless consistency.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to synthesize all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Tambor Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your focus entirely on linking every micro‑movement into an uninterrupted rhythmic cycle. In this integrated sequence, you’ll combine your deliberate forward push with your rapid, controlled hip rotations and dynamic lateral shifts to create a stroke that delivers rapid, cumulative stimulation.
Begin with a deliberate forward push. Insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push lays the essential foundation, ensuring that about 80% of your force is focused on the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone, in keeping with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Immediately after the forward push, choose your directional mode. For example, if you decide on “Tambor going right,” transition immediately into fast-paced hip rotations to the right. Execute rapid, controlled rotations—feel the hilt apply pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head swiftly moves from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. Alternatively, if you opt for “Tambor going left,” perform the mirrored rotations—with the hilt canvassing from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and the head shifting from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall. These rapid movements must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle so that cumulative stimulation is built effectively even at high speed.
Throughout the integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale fuels your rapid rotations and every controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions between the forward push and the fast-paced rotations. With every complete cycle, your Tambor Stroke transforms into a continuous, fluid performance that leverages your natural ectomorphic agility and moderate extension into a powerful expression of cumulative stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where we refine every micro‑movement of your Tambor Stroke until your performance is a flawlessly executed masterpiece of rapid, cumulative stimulation. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, every detail is crucial—even during rapid, fast-paced hip rotations. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains your guiding star: approximately 80% of your force must be directed at the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining force is evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you perform your integrated sequence, focus intently on the quality and consistency of each movement. During your forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When executing your rapid hip rotations—whether operating in the right or left mode—carefully observe how the hilt and head distribute pressure along her vaginal walls. This is where tracking becomes indispensable: each repetition provides immediate, real‑time feedback. Listen closely to her deep, rhythmic breathing; notice any subtle changes in her posture; and pay attention to soft verbal cues that indicate which elements of your stroke are most effective in building cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your immediate feedback loop, allowing you to make precise, on-the-fly adjustments.
Once you’ve gathered sufficient tracking data—aim for about 30 repetitions per directional mode—you’ll naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical state where every micro‑movement—from the forward push to each rapid hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically, as if each action were part of a perfectly choreographed dance. In flow, you consistently deliver the exact pressure and timing that your tracking has honed, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with every cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is essential during this phase; every deep inhale equips you for the next rapid action, and every controlled exhale smooths out the transitions. And if any lateral or rotational movement seems slightly off, pause, track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is impeccable.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to design your personalized practice routine—a disciplined, structured training program crafted to reinforce every aspect of your Tambor Stroke while also strengthening your core and overall stability. With your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you have the perfect combination of power, endurance, and precision. This routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that consistently delivers rapid, cumulative stimulation.
Begin by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are eliminated and your sole focus is on refining your technique. Every training session should kick off with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your mesomorph body. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these key muscle groups form the foundation of your stability and control, ensuring that every micro‑movement is executed with absolute precision. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the rigorous drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a determined, positive tone for the session.
Next, move into specialized drills, beginning with the tap keystroke drill. Assume your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that complements your powerful, balanced frame. Practice controlled lateral taps: slowly shift your body laterally until your hip gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. With your extension between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral move must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Synchronize each shift with deep, deliberate breathing—inhaling deeply before each movement and exhaling slowly as you return. Integrate kegeling exercises with every repetition to further strengthen your pelvic floor and enhance control. Aim for at least 30 precise repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke drill becomes second nature.
Once you’ve mastered the tap keystroke, integrate it with your forward push and rapid hip rotation drills. Practice a controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by drills for fast-paced hip rotations in your preferred directional mode (right or left). Focus on executing these rapid rotations with both speed and precision—the hilt must correctly canvas the appropriate vaginal segment (for right rotations, from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment; for left rotations, from the north‑western to the south‑western segment), and the head must shift accurately (from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall for right rotations, or from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall for left rotations). Drill these combined movements repeatedly until every transition is smooth and your technique consistently respects the 80‑10‑10 principle. Supplement your practice with targeted core-strengthening exercises—such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills—because your core is the foundation that ensures every movement is executed with maximum precision. Finally, maintain a detailed training journal where you log each session, record the number of repetitions, document any adjustments, and capture her feedback. This journal is an essential tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, helping you track progress and refine your technique continuously until it reaches perfection.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—the culmination of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Tambor Stroke converges into one continuous, seamless performance. In this final module, your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and your extension between 5 and 7 inches come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of intimate mastery that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified plank—with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface, your core engaged, and your mind honed for perfect precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously follow the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that about 80% of your force is channeled to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone while the remaining force is meticulously balanced to stimulate the deeper layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your chosen hip. Slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, then return smoothly to center. Focus intently on the sensation—observe how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening, and note how your shaft rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. Integrate the correct hip rotation details here: if shifting to the left, perform 2 slow rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment (with the head moving from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall); if shifting to the right, execute 2 slow rotations where the hilt moves from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment (with the head transitioning from the southwestern wall to the north‑eastern wall). If any lateral movement feels off—if the pressure isn’t perfectly balanced or the angle requires a slight tweak—pause, isolate that motion, and drill it until both your internal cues and her feedback confirm perfection.
Then, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while gathering precise internal feedback. As you push upward, contract your core and engage your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for her responses; her deep, steady breathing and soft, affirming cues will signal whether you’re delivering the optimal stimulation. If you sense that the cumulative effect isn’t at its peak, make small, mindful adjustments—tweaking your lateral angle or the pace of your forward push—and meticulously track these modifications using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps with correct hip rotations, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly in a rhythmic, unified performance. Then mirror this complete cycle on the opposite side, ensuring that cumulative stimulation is delivered evenly throughout her entire vaginal canal. The ultimate goal is to reach a state of natural flow—a condition where every movement occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve this state, your Tambor Stroke will transform into a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers the precise, targeted stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every rapid hip rotation, every lateral shift, and every micro‑adjustment is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and your extension between 5 and 7 inches will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Tambor Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure every time. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Tambor Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
