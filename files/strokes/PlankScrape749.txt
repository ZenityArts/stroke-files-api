Plank Scrape — Module 1: Orientation & Body Setup
This module exists to teach your body how to hold the forearm-plank foundation that keeps the Plank Scrape safe, powerful, and exact. The goal is to anchor posture and breath so your hips can Rock and Angle with control. Begin by grounding your elbows under your shoulders and stacking your spine in one clean line from head to tailbone. Imagine you are bridging between two walls with your body suspended at the perfect distance. Keep your core engaged, ribs drawn in, and glutes slightly active so that your pelvis stays stable and doesn’t sag or overarch. This neutral baseline is where every keystroke begins and ends. It’s the reset point that saves your wrists and shoulders from overload and ensures your thrusts stay true to the compass walls inside her.
From this baseline, inhale through your nose and feel your diaphragm widen under your ribs. Exhale through your mouth to firm your abdomen and create a small lift in your hips. That gentle lift is your preparation breath—what you’ll use every time you’re about to move. When you Rock or Angle during the stroke, think of the exhale as the carrier of pressure, not your muscle force. For the Plank Scrape, you’ll be leaning slightly left or right, which changes which wall of her body you’re engaging. Light pressure on the inhale, Medium on the exhale. For now, stay at the shallow 80% zone, where you’re mostly gliding across her front and side walls without pushing into depth. This protects stamina, prevents joint collapse, and builds precision.
Because your body type is Ectomorph, you’ll want to shorten your plank distance by a few inches to avoid overextension. Keep your elbows slightly wider and your knees under your hips when needed to drop pressure during fatigue. Your penis length between 5–7 inches means your usable range sits comfortably in the shallow and mid 10% zones without forcing depth. Focus on clarity of wall contact rather than penetration volume. Imagine your shaft as a paintbrush edge tracing a slow, deliberate diagonal. Each pass should reveal texture, not depth. When done right, she’ll respond with subtle but real cues—a slower exhale, a softening around her hips, or a gentle press upward. Your job is to notice those signals and adjust by pausing at neutral, inhaling to reset, then re-engaging at the same pressure band or slightly lighter.
Think of this foundation like tuning an instrument before playing. Every micro adjustment—where your weight sits in your forearms, where your hips hover, how you exhale—affects the tone of the stroke later. If you feel your shoulders start to cave or your hips drop too low, return to neutral, take one long inhale, and rebuild your line. That single action—resetting to baseline—is the signature move that keeps your performance sustainable. Over time, it teaches your nervous system where power and precision intersect.
To summarize this orientation in practice form: set your forearms, align your body, breathe to prepare, move with intention, and always reset to neutral. A single journaling entry might read, “Neutral at zero, shallow zone, Light pressure, hips steady, exhale on lean left, smooth breath at rep five.” This tells you what worked and keeps data for the SSP loop later.

Plank Scrape — Module 2: Keystroke Breakdown
This module teaches you the keystrokes that build the Plank Scrape stroke. Each one is a movement that starts and ends from the same neutral forearm-plank baseline you’ve just mastered. These keystrokes will be trained individually before they are chained into rhythm. Think of them as the notes that, when played together, form the melody of the stroke. Each keystroke affects a different compass wall, depth zone, and pressure band, and together they shape how she feels the scrape as a deep, rhythmic sweep along her inner walls.
The first keystroke is the Vertical Drop, which creates Rocking motion. Begin in forearm plank, inhale to prepare, and on the exhale drop your hips straight down without letting your chest collapse. Keep the spine long. This action drives the shaft downward through the shallow 80% and brushes the upper wall on entry. For the Ectomorph body, this downward motion must be short and tight—about the distance between the top and bottom edge of your palm—so the shoulders stay unloaded. With a 5–7 inch length, the Vertical Drop should stay within shallow contact, only teasing mid-depth by about ten percent. She’ll likely respond with a tightening of her abdomen or a quiet inhale as she feels the tip trace her inner ridge. Reset to neutral on the inhale and repeat for four controlled reps, logging sensations like, “Drop neutral reset, shallow, Light pressure, hips steady at rep three.”
The second keystroke is the Diagonal Lean, which defines the Angling quality of the stroke. From baseline, shift your weight subtly toward the left forearm while lifting your right hip just an inch. The penis now presses into her right wall along a downward-left diagonal. Inhale to steady, exhale as you apply Medium pressure along that wall during both insertion and withdrawal. For an Ectomorph, the leverage should come from your obliques and not your arms. You’ll feel a controlled twist through the waistline, not a wobble through the shoulders. With a 5–7 inch size, this lean enhances wall precision rather than depth. Watch for cues: her hips might turn slightly toward you or her breathing may deepen. That’s confirmation of contact clarity. When fatigue creeps in, reset to neutral and shorten the range until your Rock and Angle remain consistent.
The third keystroke is the Vertical Lift, a Rocking movement that creates the friction that defines the scrape. From neutral, inhale and subtly raise your hips on the exhale without withdrawing fully. The tip traces the wall as you lift, keeping continuous Light pressure through the shallow zone. For your build, this lift should not exceed one to two inches of movement. The goal isn’t height—it’s friction continuity. Imagine sliding a coin beneath your hips without dropping it; that’s the level of control required. She’ll likely react with a stillness or a slight curl of her pelvis as the upper wall gets stroked. Reflect between reps, noting how the friction changes as your pressure varies.
The fourth keystroke is the Diagonal Return, an Angling reversal that pairs with the lean. After lifting, drop your hips back toward the opposite diagonal, maintaining pressure on the previously contacted wall. The shaft should feel as though it’s sweeping the wall back to neutral. For Ectomorph bodies, this counteraction balances your spine and prevents torque. The motion completes the scrape arc. Keep the movement slow and exhaled through Medium pressure, returning to Light as you approach neutral. This combination of Lean and Return forms the lateral rhythm that defines the stroke’s sensual identity.
In practice, train these keystrokes one at a time until each can be performed without collapse or confusion. Begin with the Vertical Drop and Vertical Lift to understand the Rocking axis, then add the Diagonal Lean and Return to establish Angling control. Each keystroke must start and end at the same neutral plank line, guided by breath and observation of partner cues. When all four can be executed cleanly, the Plank Scrape begins to emerge naturally as a diagonal rhythm that scrapes and releases in a seamless pattern.
A single journaling note might read, “Lean left, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, exhale steady, hip curl response at rep four.” These brief logs are your SSP evidence of connection and precision.

Plank Scrape — Module 3: Constructing the Stroke
Now that your body knows each keystroke, this module teaches you to weave them into a full Plank Scrape rhythm. The key is not power, but flow. Every part of your movement must begin and end at the neutral plank baseline—wrists steady, spine long, hips aligned—and every stroke must travel through the same rhythm cycle: Rock, Angle, Reset, and Rebuild. Think of this as a slow breathing engine. The inhale stabilizes; the exhale drives motion. The full stroke should feel like one continuous diagonal sweep that presses, drags, and releases in a controlled arc.
Start by anchoring your forearms and drawing one deep breath into your diaphragm. On the exhale, allow your hips to drop in a Vertical Drop, letting the head of your shaft trace downward into her shallow 80%. You’ll feel the front wall connect. Without pausing long, begin the Diagonal Lean—shift your weight slightly left, tilting your hips so that the shaft now glides along her right wall in a low, scraping drag. Keep Medium pressure through the exhale. The movement should feel like a painter’s brush moving diagonally across a textured surface. Inhale to lift your hips through the Vertical Lift, maintaining contact, not retreating. Then use the Diagonal Return to guide your hips back through center and slightly right, keeping contact alive along the same wall. One full breath cycle—inhale to prepare, exhale to drop and lean, inhale to lift, exhale to return—forms the pulse of one complete Plank Scrape.
Because your body type is Ectomorph, your goal is stability over amplitude. Keep your movement tight and measured, about two inches total range. Your natural frame gives you light leverage, so distribute your load evenly through forearms and toes. Avoid arching or collapsing through the lumbar spine. The plank must remain quiet in your upper body while the hips perform the dialogue. With a 5–7 inch length, you’ll stay in the shallow and mid 10% zones—never bottoming out. The intent is a textured glide that she feels as a rubbing whisper, not a thrust.
As the stroke takes shape, keep breath tied to every motion. The drop and lean belong to the exhale; the lift and return belong to the inhale. This keeps your nervous system calm and lets your rhythm last. After each cycle, pause at neutral and listen. Her body may give you feedback—a longer exhale, hips pressing in, or a subtle pelvic curl. These are confirmations that your pressure and wall contact are right. If she goes quiet or pulls away slightly, lighten pressure or shorten range for a few cycles. That responsiveness is the essence of mastery; it’s what turns mechanics into sensitivity.
When chaining keystrokes, think of your hips tracing a small figure-eight tilted along her right wall. The scrape emerges not from speed but from control—each diagonal acting like one spoke of a wheel. The rhythm can be sustained for long sessions without fatigue if you honor rest hygiene. Every 20 cycles, especially for an Ectomorph, pause for two breaths in neutral to protect shoulder and core load.
A clear journal note for this stage could read, “Left diagonal scrape, shallow, Medium pressure, smooth at rep seven, hips stable.” This captures the technical and sensory checkpoint in one sentence and keeps your SSP data consistent.

====================================================================================
Plank Scrape — Module 4: Tracking Phase Execution
This module teaches you to track precision within the shallow 80% zone of the Plank Scrape. Tracking means observing, testing, and refining your wall contact without chasing depth. The goal is clarity—learning exactly how each wall responds and how your Rocking and Angling combine to create the most consistent scrape. You’re gathering data on what she feels, what you feel, and how those two sensations align. Every repetition becomes a small experiment inside the SSP loop: Define, Hypothesize, Track, and Refine.
Begin in your clean neutral forearm-plank posture. Take a long inhale to set your baseline. On the first exhale, perform a slow Vertical Drop and feel the glide of your shaft across her front wall. Stay shallow, using only Light pressure. This first contact defines your reference point. On the next exhale, add a Diagonal Lean to the left so your shaft sweeps her right wall in a controlled arc. Breathe through each movement deliberately, keeping hips steady and your forearms grounded. The goal isn’t performance—it’s observation. Notice whether her breathing changes or her hips subtly press in. That’s your confirmation of proper wall connection. Inhale to reset, exhale to repeat. Four or five slow cycles like this give you the data you need to understand how shallow friction communicates.
For your Ectomorph build, the challenge is stability. Because you have a lighter frame, your body can over-rotate easily when you lean. Keep your elbows slightly wider than shoulders and focus on engaging your lower abdominals to anchor the movement. The motion should feel like a calm rocking boat—steady rhythm, no side wobble. With your 5–7 inch size, shallow contact is naturally more tactile, letting you detect subtler shifts in resistance. Stay within that tactile range; you’re tracing the grain of her inner wall, not digging beneath it. If you feel tension in your lower back or shoulders, stop immediately and reset to neutral before continuing.
Each set in the Tracking phase is a dialogue, not a drill. Define what you’re testing—for example, pressure modulation. Hypothesize that Medium pressure will yield stronger pelvic feedback. Run a short set of ten slow cycles, keeping breath steady, and observe. If her hips respond earlier or her exhale deepens, your hypothesis is confirmed. Refine by holding that same pressure for another mini-set. Then test a lighter touch for contrast. Through these SSP loops, you’ll learn how small changes in pressure alter response and endurance.
When you’ve gathered enough cues—her breath syncing with yours, her hips finding your rhythm—pause at neutral and journal your observation. One example might read, “Right wall, shallow zone, Medium pressure, deeper breath at rep eight, confirmed cue.” This line captures your physical and observational state for review later.
If fatigue sets in, take two full breaths in neutral to offload your core. Ectomorph bodies recover quickly but need short resets to maintain alignment. Keep sessions under five minutes per wall and alternate sides to balance the spine. By the end of this module, your body should know exactly where her shallow textures start to shift and how your breath keeps the rhythm alive.

====================================================================================
Plank Scrape — Module 5: Flow Phase (Shallow or Mid)
This module teaches you to enter and sustain Flow—where the keystrokes fuse into one continuous rhythm. In Flow, your mind quiets and your body knows what to do. The mechanics you learned now dissolve into sensation. You’re not analyzing the stroke; you’re riding it. The Plank Scrape becomes a wave that rolls diagonally through her walls while you maintain calm, measured breath and unwavering posture.
Begin from neutral plank. Inhale deeply through your diaphragm, feel your spine extend, and on the exhale drop your hips into the Vertical Drop. Without pause, guide into the Diagonal Lean so the shaft drags along her right wall in one seamless glide. Breathe through the movement—exhale during the downward and diagonal sweep, inhale as you lift back through the Vertical Lift and Diagonal Return. The full cycle should last about five seconds. There’s no stop or jerk between keystrokes; it’s a single fluid motion. For the Ectomorph frame, keep the amplitude small, letting your strength come from core engagement rather than limb leverage. With a 5–7 inch length, Flow lives within the shallow 80% and occasionally brushes the mid 10%, never deeper.
As Flow takes over, she should begin to melt beneath you. Watch for signs—hips drawing in, subtle pelvic curls, or a long exhale that syncs with yours. When her breathing starts matching your cycle, you’ve achieved synchrony. Maintain Medium pressure through the diagonal sweep and lighten on the lift. It should feel to you like tracing a smooth ridge with the flat of your palm, never losing contact, never pressing so hard the texture vanishes. If tension rises in your shoulders or your hips begin to wobble, pause in neutral and re-center before continuing.
For Flow, your focus is rhythm and breath integrity. Count in your head—inhale two beats, exhale three. This ratio keeps the motion slow and sustainable. The 80–10–10 principle still applies: most of your strokes stay shallow, a few drift toward mid-depth when she opens, and none exceed that. Shallow zones build rhythm, mid zones add density. If she begins to hold her breath or stiffen, it means you’ve crossed her comfortable limit. Return immediately to shallow motion until she relaxes again.
Flow is where stamina and sensitivity meet. Your ectomorphic structure favors endurance, but only if you prevent joint strain. Every 20 cycles, stop for one neutral reset—two full breaths, spine long, hips relaxed. That pause recharges your stability so you can keep Flow alive without collapse. Think of it as tuning the string of an instrument before it goes out of key.
A single journal reflection after Flow training might read, “Left diagonal, shallow 80%, smooth rhythm, hips synced, exhale steady at minute three.” This short note captures timing, depth, and cue awareness all in one.

====================================================================================
Plank Scrape — Module 6: Flow Deep Option
This module explores the deep extension of the Plank Scrape, where control replaces curiosity. You’ve already built rhythm and wall clarity; now the task is to extend slightly into the mid and deep 10% zones while keeping full awareness. Deep Flow is not about penetration—it’s about the integrity of your diagonal scrape under increased resistance. Think of the deeper layer as a denser current beneath calm water. You’re testing how your stroke holds form when pressure and feedback intensify.
Begin from the neutral plank. Inhale to stabilize your forearms and engage your lower abdominals. On the exhale, perform the Vertical Drop, allowing your hips to descend slightly more than before, extending the range by no more than one inch. With a 5–7 inch length, that extra inch will brush into the mid 10% comfortably, rarely touching the deep 10%. As you feel this new resistance, transition smoothly into the Diagonal Lean toward the chosen side. This moment defines the Deep Option: your shaft glides along her inner wall with slightly heavier friction. Maintain Medium pressure; if you press Hard, her pelvic floor will guard instead of open.
As you move, notice the difference in texture. The deep layer feels slower, denser, as if the walls are wrapping around you. For an Ectomorph, resist the instinct to compensate by dropping more weight. Keep your frame light but intentional. Use breath as your stabilizer—inhale on the lift, exhale through the deeper diagonal, and imagine your breath pressing the air down your spine to meet your hips. The movement must remain diagonal, not vertical; a downward thrust would break her comfort threshold. The diagonal keeps it sensual, scraping rather than stabbing.
You’ll know she’s receiving the depth well when her hips rotate gently to follow you, or when her breath deepens without tensing. If she pauses or tightens, you’ve gone too far. Return immediately to the shallow 80% and rebuild rhythm until her body invites you back in. The deep option is permission-based; it’s given through her relaxation, not your control. When done correctly, this range adds a grounded fullness to the scrape that feels like a slow pulse pressing through her entire core.
Because of your light build, keep joint hygiene strict. Every 15–20 cycles, return to neutral for two full breaths. Let your shoulders decompress and wrists realign before continuing. Never arch your spine during the deeper phase—keep it long and engaged, with hips and chest moving as one unit. Fatigue will show as tremor or neck strain; if that appears, stop immediately and reset.
One metaphor helps here: imagine you’re tracing the inside of a bowl, staying curved with it, never digging through. That curved motion is what keeps depth safe. She feels it as a heavy, massaging drag—pressure that both fills and relieves.
Your journal reflection might read, “Right wall, mid 10%, Medium pressure, hips steady, her breath followed at rep five.” That single note captures range, intensity, and feedback for later refinement.

====================================================================================
Plank Scrape — Module 7: Pinning Post-Orgasm Strategy
This module teaches you how to stabilize and extend pleasure through the pinning phase, the point after her climax when the body wants to rest yet can still respond to precise, minimal movement. Pinning isn’t about more thrust—it’s about controlled stillness with micro-angle shifts that tease the next wave awake. After the deep rhythm of Flow, you return to grounded awareness, keeping the shaft inside her but letting the intensity melt into slow, deliberate guidance. Think of it as holding the final note of a song, letting it vibrate rather than cutting it off.
Start in a clean neutral plank, breathing through your nose, feeling your forearms anchor the weight. As her body softens after orgasm, stay inside at shallow depth—no more than the 80% zone. Inhale slowly, feel your abdomen expand, then exhale through a tiny Diagonal Lean to the right wall. The motion is small, no more than a thumb’s width, enough to create a faint scrape without re-igniting thrust. Hold for two breaths. On the next inhale, return to neutral, then exhale through a Vertical Lift that keeps the head of the shaft barely inside, stretching her inner wall upward like a soft lift of air. Each of these moves should feel suspended, like slow tides that touch but never push.
For your Ectomorph frame, rely on breath and core tone rather than arm or leg strength. Your lighter build allows precise pivots; use that to trace the wall’s texture with subtle Rocking. With a 5–7 inch length, stay within the shallow-to-mid range to prevent overstimulation. The aim is not penetration depth but sensory finesse—maintaining enough contact that her body stays open and pulsing. Watch her cues closely: if she releases a low exhale, arches slightly, or curls her pelvis toward you, she’s absorbing the pressure. If she stiffens or flinches, pause immediately and hold still, breathing together until her tension releases.
The SSP loop here shifts from tracking to micro-testing: Observe, Tweak, Test. Observe her breath and pelvic rhythm. Tweak angle by five to ten degrees or pressure by a fraction—Light to slightly under Medium—and test again. Each tiny variation should produce a change in her response. Your task is to discover the combination that sustains her relaxation while sparking subtle new waves. When done correctly, the Plank Scrape’s broad diagonal friction becomes a faint hum that keeps her sensitive and connected long after climax.
Every few minutes, re-anchor in neutral for shoulder and wrist safety. Keep elbows soft and hips aligned with spine; never sag or arch under fatigue. The Ectomorph’s advantage is endurance, but only when posture remains clean. Rest when trembling starts, then resume.
A single journal reflection might read, “Left wall pin, shallow 80%, Light pressure, hips followed, stillness melted at minute two.” This record marks your control under stillness and her response window for future refinement.

Plank Scrape — Module 8: Training Plan & Integration
This final module brings everything together into a practical four-week training rhythm that solidifies muscle memory, precision, and stamina. You’ve built each keystroke, chained them into rhythm, and explored Flow and Pinning. Now the goal is to integrate all of it into consistent practice that keeps your body safe and your stroke sharp. The structure here is simple: daily short sets, measured breath, mindful tracking, and reflection after each session.
Begin each practice day with a neutral plank baseline. Forearms firm, shoulders stacked, hips level, core engaged. Spend one full minute here breathing through your nose—inhale two counts, exhale three. This resets your nervous system and ensures that every stroke begins from stability. For an Ectomorph, this posture control prevents shoulder fatigue and lets the core carry the workload instead of the arms. During Week 1, focus only on shallow 80% work: vertical drops and diagonal leans without chaining. This period is your recalibration stage. Keep pressure Light to Medium and prioritize clarity of wall contact over intensity. Record each session in shorthand, noting compass direction and pressure. A line might read, “Right wall, shallow, Medium pressure, steady rhythm at minute one.”
By Week 2, begin chaining the keystrokes—Vertical Drop, Diagonal Lean, Vertical Lift, Diagonal Return—into continuous cycles. Let your breath drive the motion, exhaling on the downward scrape and inhaling on the upward lift. Keep cycles slow and even, about five seconds each. This week emphasizes endurance: thirty to forty strokes per set, resting twenty seconds between. Use the SSP loop to refine: define your hypothesis (“Medium pressure increases warmth”), track it, observe her cues, and refine.
In Week 3, introduce mid-zone exploration when her body invites it. Stay mindful of the 80–10–10 rule—most strokes shallow, some mid, few deep. Use these deeper extensions to train stability under resistance. Never push for depth; let gravity and breath open the range naturally. If she breathes deeper and her pelvis follows your motion, you’ve found safe territory. If she withdraws or tightens, return to shallow. This week also trains recovery—reset every twenty cycles to protect joints.
Week 4 integrates Pinning. Alternate between short Flow bursts and still holding patterns. The purpose is control: learning to rise and fall between motion and quiet without breaking rhythm. Use each still phase to feel her feedback and your own heartbeat slowing. End each session by journaling one sensory discovery—something you noticed about the wall texture, her breathing, or your stamina window. Over time, these notes build your personal map of her anatomy and your endurance.
Across all weeks, maintain discipline in rest hygiene. Ectomorphs recover best through short deloads, so take one rest day after every three training days. Stretch shoulders and wrists daily to avoid compression. Keep lubrication natural and depth limited to protect her comfort and your joint longevity.
When integrated properly, the Plank Scrape becomes more than a stroke—it’s a diagnostic rhythm that teaches you to read her body through friction and breath. Each repetition strengthens the nervous link between your hips and her pleasure. Your practice is no longer mechanical; it’s responsive, adaptive, alive.
A single final journal reflection might read, “Right wall, shallow 80%, five-second rhythm, pulse matched, still calm at finish.” That one line captures control, sensitivity, and rhythm integrity—the hallmarks of mastery.
