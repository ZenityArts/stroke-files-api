Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey as you learn to master The Merengue. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to work with you—specifically designed for a man with your sturdy, full‑figured, endomorphic build and a penis shape measuring between five and seven inches. Today, you’re starting a process that will help convert your inherent robust strength and endurance into a series of deliberate, precise movements that deliver powerful, cumulative stimulation during intercourse. As you settle into a quiet, comfortable space where you can fully concentrate on these instructions, I encourage you to close your eyes, take several deep, steady breaths, and let my voice center your focus. Every movement you make from this moment on is about channeling your natural power into controlled, intimate actions that connect you deeply with your partner.
In The Merengue, you begin in the classic missionary position, adopting a modified plank stance with your knees gently in contact with a supportive surface. This position is your anchor—it not only grounds you but also ensures that every micro‑movement is executed with deliberate precision. With your penis inserted at a downward diagonal angle, you first drop your hips slowly onto the canvas so that the head of your penis points firmly toward the north. This initial move—dropping your hips and executing a leaned vertical insertion—sets the foundation of the stroke, establishing the appropriate angle and level of engagement from which everything else builds.
Once you’ve accomplished the vertical phase, you shift your entire body laterally. For instance, you might begin by moving your body westward, towards your partner’s right hip. As you do, the left shelf of your penis’ shaft glides deliberately over the right side of her vaginal opening while, simultaneously, the right shelf makes soft, steady contact with her left internal wall. You repeat this controlled lateral shift three times. In each repetition, you apply a specific amount of bodyweight to create a rhythmic compression that alternates stimulation between the walls—a process repeated until a consistent, cumulative effect is achieved. After completing the three lateral cycles, you then perform a vertical pushout—moving your body upward so that the head of your penis is completely inside—followed by another vertical insertion. This sequence then repeats: first, you execute a series of lateral motions in one direction, then you reset by a pushout and vertical drop, and then the lateral motion is performed in the opposite direction. Each phase is meticulously timed and controlled, transforming every micro‑movement into a deliberate act of intimate contact.
For you, as an endomorph with a moderate extension, every inch matters. Your body is built for endurance and delivers power from a broad, stable base, but these strengths require that you work with precision rather than explosive, expansive movement. The Merengue is all about converting that raw, robust power into finely calibrated, rhythmic sequences where even the smallest lateral tap or vertical pushout is executed with deliberate control. Every drop of your hips, every calculated lateral shift, becomes an opportunity to build cumulative stimulation that is targeted precisely where it is most effective. As you embark on this journey, embrace the idea that the art of The Merengue lies in the interplay between your substantial endurance and the disciplined, measured application of every movement. Welcome, brother—your journey to transforming raw power into controlled, intimate mastery begins now.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding Your Unique Profile and Anatomy
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re going to explore your unique physical characteristics—specifically, your robust endomorphic build paired with a penis shape measuring between five and seven inches—to ensure that every element of The Merengue is precisely tailored to your physique. As an endomorph, your body carries significant mass, with a fuller, more rounded structure that provides you with a stable, powerful base and impressive endurance. Your broad shoulders, solid core, and overall weight are assets that allow you to generate consistent, controlled pressure. However, because your anatomical extension is moderate (between five and seven inches), every micro‑movement in your stroke must be carefully compressed and precisely executed. There’s no room for slack; every fraction of movement must be turned into intentional, effective contact.
Visualize your body as a finely tuned engine, where each component—from your sturdy, powerful chest to your resilient abdominal muscles—plays a critical role in executing controlled, deliberate movements. Your core, in particular, is essential; it not only holds your body together but also ensures that every forward slide, lateral shift, or pushout is delivered with unwavering stability. Because your extension is not excessively long, you must concentrate on making each movement as efficient as possible: every drop of your hips and every lateral tap must be measured and deliberate to maximize the effectiveness of your contact. Your training will revolve around converting raw, powerful motion into a series of micro‑adjustments that are perfectly timed and executed.
This is where the foundational concepts, such as the 80‑10‑10 principle, come into play. With your endomorphic build, you’ll focus approximately 80% of your stimulation on the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone (around 1–3 inches), while the remaining 20% is divided equally between the mid‑depth (3–5 inches) and deep regions. This method ensures that you harness your strength without overcompensating in any one area, delivering a balanced, cumulative stimulation that is both effective and comfortable.
Your training is not merely physical—it’s an exercise in internal awareness. Every contraction in your core, every slight shift in your pelvic floor muscles, provides the feedback you need to adjust your movements with exact precision. This deep internal monitoring is critical, especially given your stable yet powerful build. By combining the natural endurance of your body with deliberate, measured movements, you will optimize every stroke so that your performance is both incredibly satisfying to your partner and a true reflection of your refined, disciplined technique.
Embrace the understanding that your endomorphic traits—your natural stability, substantial power, and ability to maintain focused, consistent pressure—are the basis upon which you will refine your technique. By tuning in to your internal signals and leveraging your robust physique, you’ll adapt The Merengue in such a way that every micro‑movement is maximized for intimacy and cumulative stimulation. This understanding is the foundation for every step forward in your training, paving the way for you to convert raw physicality into a deliberate, deeply connected performance that is both technically precise and emotionally powerful.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing The Merengue into Its Fundamental Components
Now let’s break down The Merengue into its core components so that you can master each individual element before uniting them into a fluid, cohesive performance. Picture yourself in the missionary position—on top in a modified plank with your knees resting on a stable surface, your body perfectly aligned, and your core engaged for deliberate action. The Merengue is a finely tuned sequence that blends vertical and lateral movements into an intricate dance of controlled compression and rhythmic stimulation. For a man with your endomorphic build and a penis shape measuring between five and seven inches, every micro‑movement must be executed with absolute precision to ensure that every fraction of motion delivers intense, cumulative pleasure.
The sequence begins with the vertical phase. First, you insert the head of your penis at a downward diagonal angle. Then, you slowly drop your hips onto the canvas so that the head points squarely to the north. This controlled hip drop is vital: it establishes the correct angle and sets the stage for the subsequent movements. With your hips dropped, you perform a leaned vertical insertion—this movement aligns your body for maximum control and creates the proper contact necessary for the lateral elements to follow.
Next, the stroke moves into the lateral phase. From your established vertical position, you shift your entire body laterally. Start by moving toward the west—toward your partner’s right hip. As you shift left, the left shelf of your penis’ shaft is guided to consistently massage the right side of her vaginal opening, while the right shelf simultaneously glides along her left internal wall. This lateral shift, executed with controlled bodyweight, produces a rhythmic rocking sensation that is fundamental to The Merengue. In your training, you repeat this lateral movement three times to build consistency and precise compression. For many, the foundation for this lateral movement is the Tap keystroke—a basic yet essential lateral shift performed from a forearm plank: you shift until your hip gently taps the canvas, then return to the center, generating a rhythmic, seesaw-like motion. This tapping motion is integral to developing the muscle memory required for these subtle lateral adjustments.
After completing three cycles toward the west, you perform a vertical pushout. This upward, controlled movement resets your position, moving your body vertically outward until the head of your penis is fully inside, and then you perform another leaned vertical insertion. You then repeat the lateral shift process for another three cycles in the same direction, applying controlled bodyweight with each movement to maintain a consistent, rhythmic compression. Following these cycles, you execute another pushout and then slowly drop your hips so that the head of your penis again points north, repeating the vertical insertion. Then, the stroke transitions as you shift laterally to the east. In this phase, the stimulation pattern reverses: the right shelf now massages the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening, while the left shelf gently caresses her right internal wall. This lateral movement, repeated three times with controlled bodyweight, is again followed by a vertical pushout that resets the cycle, preparing you to start anew on the opposite side.
Each phase of The Merengue is engineered to work in harmony with your natural endomorphic power and moderate extension. Every micro‑movement—vertical drop, lateral shift using the Tap keystroke, controlled pushout, and re‑insertion—has been designed to extract maximum stimulation with minimal extraneous motion. By breaking down the stroke into these four fundamental components, you gain a precise roadmap for training. Every controlled adjustment is essential to achieving the cumulative, rhythmic pattern that transforms raw power into refined, effective stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Now that we’ve deconstructed The Merengue into its basic components, it’s time to drill each element intensively until every micro‑movement becomes a natural, automatic part of your performance. Position yourself in the missionary stance—on top in a modified plank with your knees resting steadily on a supportive surface. Ensure you are in a quiet space where you can fully concentrate. Close your eyes, take several deep, deliberate breaths, and let the rhythm of your breathing center your attention on building precision in every detail of your movement.
Begin by drilling the vertical phase. Start with your penis inserted at a downward diagonal angle, then slowly drop your hips onto the canvas so that the head points toward the north. This drop should be executed as slowly as possible—each degree of descent must be measured and controlled. Hold this lowered position momentarily to internalize the precise angle and pressure that create the perfect insertion foundation. Repeat this vertical drop and leaned vertical insertion multiple times until the movement becomes second nature and you can do it with consistent precision despite the natural challenges of an endomorphic build.
Next, focus on the lateral component and drill the Tap keystroke. From the position achieved after your vertical drop, gradually shift your body laterally to the west—until your hip softly taps the supporting surface. As you perform this lateral movement, concentrate on ensuring that the left shelf of your penis is consistently delivering controlled, rhythmic compression against the right side of your partner’s vaginal opening, while the right shelf provides gentle contact with her left internal wall. Because your extension is moderate, every inch of this lateral shift is crucial to generating the desired intimate pressure. Integrate “stroke breathing” into the drill by inhaling deeply as you prepare to move and exhaling slowly as you complete the tap. In addition, incorporate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor muscles as you shift laterally; this enhances your internal control and reinforces the precise, rhythmic rocking that the Tap keystroke is designed to develop. Repeat this lateral tapping exercise for a minimum of 30 repetitions on each side until the controlled movement becomes fluid and automatic.
After you have mastered the lateral drills independently, transition to the vertical pushout. Following your lateral taps, practice moving vertically outward—pushing out your body in a controlled manner until the head of your penis is fully inside—thereby resetting your position for another cycle. Execute this vertical pushout slowly and ensure that the transition between the lateral movement and the vertical extension is seamless. Drill the sequence of vertical drop and insertion, lateral taps (using the Tap keystroke) for three cycles in one direction, followed by a vertical pushout and reinsertion, repeatedly until every micro‑movement is precise and naturally integrated.
Throughout this drilling phase, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing to serve as your internal metronome—each inhalation drawing your focus inward and each exhalation releasing any tension that might disrupt your control. With consistent practice, every component of The Merengue—from the vertical drop to the lateral Tap keystroke and controlled pushout—will become thoroughly ingrained in your muscle memory, laying the foundation for a fully integrated, instinctive performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now that each component of The Merengue has been drilled with focused intention, it’s time to integrate them into a seamless, continuous sequence that embodies the perfected stroke. Return to your starting missionary position—on top in a modified plank with your knees on a firm, supportive surface, your body aligned, your core engaged, and your mind wholly focused on executing a flawless performance.
Begin the integrated sequence with the vertical drop and insertion. Slowly lower your hips until your penis, inserted at a downward diagonal angle, is perfectly aligned with the intended contact, and the head is directed toward the north. Allow yourself a brief, mindful pause to feel the tension and the delicate pressure of that vertical setting. This pause is essential—it resets your internal rhythm and prepares you for the next phase.
Immediately following the vertical insertion, transition into the lateral phase. Initiate the westward lateral shift using the Tap keystroke—gradually moving your upper body to the left in controlled, measured increments until your hip gently taps the surface. As you shift laterally, ensure that the left shelf of your penis consistently compresses the right side of your partner’s vaginal opening, while the right shelf makes soft, even contact with her left internal wall. Repeat this lateral movement three times, keeping the motion rhythmic and deliberate, with each tap reinforcing the precise, controlled rocking of your body.
Following the lateral taps, perform a vertical pushout—gently extending your body outward so that the head is fully inserted—and then execute another vertical insertion to reset the cycle. Once the westward sequence is complete, immediately mirror the sequence by shifting laterally toward the east. In this mirrored phase, the right shelf of your penis engages the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening, and the left shelf provides measured compression on her right internal wall. Execute three smooth lateral taps in this direction, followed by a controlled vertical pushout and subsequent vertical insertion. Conclude the full cycle with a brief re-entry reset—a sharp, controlled upward burst that re-establishes your posture and signals the seamless transition to the next cycle.
Throughout your integrated practice, maintain a steady, deep breathing pattern that acts as your internal metronome. Each cycle should flow effortlessly into the next, with every micro‑movement—vertical and lateral—merging into one continuous, rhythmic dance of intimate precision. With every repetition, observe how the transitions become smoother and how your entire performance evolves into an instinctive, fully integrated expression of refined technique. Your integrated sequence is the culmination of focused drilling and deep internal control, blending raw power with measured elegance into a performance that is both technically flawless and deeply intimate.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Now, we transition into the advanced phase of your training, where our focus is on meticulously fine-tuning every aspect of The Merengue through the deliberate application of the 80‑10‑10 principle, continuous tracking, and the Sexual Scientific Process. In this stage, each micro‑adjustment you make is dedicated to channeling your masculine energy with pinpoint accuracy, ensuring that every cycle of the stroke delivers balanced and cumulative stimulation.
Begin by applying the 80‑10‑10 principle: as you execute each lateral shift, concentrate approximately 80% of your applied pressure on the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone (typically the first 1–3 inches), where the nerve endings are most abundant. The remaining 20% is divided equally between the mid‑depth (3–5 inches) and deep zones (beyond 5 inches). With your compact extension, every slight change in angle or compression carries significant impact. You must calibrate each lateral tap and vertical pushout carefully so that the majority of the stimulation is concentrated on the shallow zone, with the additional energy providing just enough contact to balance the overall experience.
Next, integrate the Sexual Scientific Process into your practice. Begin each session by defining your goal: for example, achieving maximum stimulation on a specific vaginal wall. Form a hypothesis about which components of your stroke—such as a particular angle during lateral taps or a specific intensity in the vertical pushout—will produce the best result. Then, move to the tracking phase: systematically perform your stroke against each of the four vaginal walls (north, south, east, and west) for a minimum of 30 strokes per wall. Observe and record your partner’s responses—the visible cues, alterations in her breathing, and any verbal feedback—so you can determine which wall receives the optimal stimulation from your current technique.
Once you have identified the most effective stroke pattern, you enter the flow phase. Flow is the state where your technique becomes an automatic, rhythmic sequence, delivered consistently with the precision established during your tracking. In this phase, you commit to maintaining a consistent pace and steady pressure where 80% of the stimulation focuses on the shallow zone, while 10% is applied to mid‑depth and 10% to deep stimulation. This balanced rhythmic execution ensures that every repetition builds cumulative pleasure over time.
Throughout every cycle, remain deeply attuned to your internal feedback—monitor every slight contraction of your core, every minuscule shift in pressure, and every subtle variation in your breathing. These internal cues are your guideposts for making micro‑adjustments in your movement and help you fine‑tune your angling and rocking intensity. Controlled rocking is generated naturally through your deliberate hip drop and lateral Tap keystroke—it acts like a gentle pulsation that continuously massages the sensitive areas of your partner’s vaginal canal. Adjust this rocking until it becomes steady and perfectly integrated with the vertical and lateral motions. The ongoing dialogue between your physical performance and your internal feedback, underpinned by the 80‑10‑10 strategy, transforms your technique into a seamless, dynamically refined performance that is both methodical and deeply intimate.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, we arrive at a critical stage where you create a personalized practice routine that reinforces every element of The Merengue and builds the vital core stability required for your ectomorphic attributes and extended anatomical range above seven inches. Imagine a dedicated, quiet space—your personal sanctuary—where every breath, every sound, and every movement is dedicated solely to refining your technique and transforming your raw power into a disciplined performance of intimate art.
Begin each training session with a comprehensive warm‑up that targets your core, hips, and lower back—the foundational pillars of your controlled movement. Engage in dynamic stretching that focuses on your lean, agile muscles; allow each stretch to awaken your core and prime your body for precise, controlled motion. Visualize each warm‑up as a deliberate activation of your internal engine, setting the stage for the technical rigor that follows. As your muscles become activated and your internal focus sharpens, feel the raw potential of your ectomorphic attributes merging into a state of refined control.
Once your body is warmed and your mind is focused, transition into specialized drills tailored to The Merengue. Begin with the fundamental Tap keystroke, a building block for achieving controlled lateral movement. From your forearm plank position, practice shifting laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, then return smoothly to the center. Focus on the precision of each tap—ensuring that your left shelf compresses the right side of your partner’s vaginal opening consistently, while your right shelf maintains steady contact with the opposite wall. Incorporate “stroke breathing” into this drill: inhale deeply as you prepare to move, and exhale steadily as you complete each lateral shift. In addition, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor muscles with every tap, which bolsters your control and fine‑tunes the rhythmic pressure needed for effective stimulation. Use visualization techniques to picture the gentle, rhythmic rocking and massage that each tap produces—seeing in your mind the focused, intimate contact that builds with every controlled movement.
Progress to drills that combine the vertical and lateral elements of the stroke. Start with a vertical drop: slowly lower your hips until your penis is inserted at the desired downward diagonal angle and the head points north. Drill this movement repeatedly until you can execute it with absolute control. Then, seamlessly integrate lateral taps toward one side (for example, westward) following the vertical drop. Repeat this combined movement—vertical insertion followed by three lateral taps—then perform a controlled vertical pushout that resets your position before another vertical insertion. After mastering this integrated drill in one direction, mirror the process for the opposite lateral movement. Finally, link these components into a full-cycle sequence where you perform the vertical drop and insertion, lateral taps, a pushout, and then a re-entry reset—a short, controlled upward burst that resets your body for a new cycle. Always use deep, steady breathing to keep your movements synchronized and to act as an internal metronome. Record each detail of your experience in a training journal so that you capture every sensation, adjustment, and improvement. Supplement your routine with targeted core-strengthening exercises—planks, abdominal workouts, and dynamic stability routines—to ensure your internal foundation remains strong and responsive. This personalized practice routine is your blueprint for turning raw power into a finely tuned performance that is both effective and intimately satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Now, brother, we arrive at the final, culminating stage of your journey—a phase dedicated to the advanced integration of every component of The Merengue, meticulous troubleshooting, and the final refinements that will elevate your performance to a state of absolute mastery. In a quiet, focused space free from distraction, you will run through the entire sequence continuously—from the vertical drop and insertion, through the lateral taps and controlled pushouts, to the final re-entry reset—while scrutinizing every minute detail for perfection.
Begin by executing the vertical drop with absolute precision: lower your hips slowly so that the head of your penis points firmly north; every fraction of that movement must be controlled, ensuring that the downward diagonal alignment is maintained. Listen to your body’s internal cues—if the drop happens too quickly or if the angle isn’t quite right, pause and adjust your movement until every micro‑adjustment is measured and consistent. This initial phase is crucial, as it sets the precise foundation for all lateral and vertical components that follow.
Next, transition into the lateral phase by performing the Tap keystroke. Slowly shift your upper body laterally toward the west, allowing your hip to gently tap the surface. As you execute each lateral tap, pay close attention to the pressure being applied; the left shelf of your penis should consistently provide controlled compression against the right side of your partner’s vaginal opening, while the right shelf maintains subtle contact with her left internal wall. If the lateral movement feels too rapid or if the compression seems uneven, isolate that segment and drill it repeatedly until it becomes smooth and controlled. Complete three consecutive lateral taps, then move seamlessly into a vertical pushout—your body moves slowly upward until the head of your penis is fully inserted, effectively resetting the cycle.
Mirror this process by performing lateral taps toward the east—the stimulation pattern reverses, with the right shelf engaging the left vaginal wall and the left shelf softly massaging the right internal wall—repeating the movement three times before executing another vertical pushout and insertion. Finally, complete each cycle with a re-entry reset—a brief, controlled upward burst that resets your posture while preserving the critical downward diagonal alignment. This final punctuation must be executed with razor‑sharp precision; if it feels too forceful or insufficiently crisp, practice it in isolation until it seamlessly integrates with the rest of your cycle.
Throughout this final advanced integration phase, consistently apply the 80‑10‑10 principle: ensure that around 80% of the stimulation is focused on the shallow, most sensitive vaginal zone, with the remaining 20% split evenly between the mid‑depth and deep regions. This precise distribution is essential for balanced, cumulative stimulation. Be continuously alert to your internal feedback—monitor every slight variation in muscle tension, every subtle change in your breathing pattern, and every discreet cue from your partner. These signals are your guide, allowing you to fine‑tune each micro‑adjustment in real time. Through persistent tracking, experimentation, and adjustment—the core of the Sexual Scientific Process—you will refine every element of your performance until each cycle of The Merengue flows effortlessly as an integrated expression of controlled, intimate mastery.
As you conclude this final module, reflect on the journey from the very first step of The Merengue to the advanced, fully integrated performance that now flows naturally from you. Mastery is an ongoing process—each cycle, each micro‑adjustment, brings you closer to a performance that is both technically flawless and deeply satisfying. May every repetition serve as a testament to your dedication and skill—a dynamic fusion of raw, endomorphic power and precise, deliberate control. Happy training, brother, and may your pursuit of intimate mastery continue to grow with every perfectly executed, refined stroke.
