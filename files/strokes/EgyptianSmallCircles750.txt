Module 1 of the Egyptian Small Circles teaches how to build a body foundation that keeps every movement precise and safe. The goal is to make your plank posture stable enough that your hips can move freely without transferring strain to your wrists, shoulders, or lower back. Begin in a forearm plank, elbows directly under your shoulders and palms flat on the canvas. Your spine should feel like a single line from crown to tailbone. Keep your hips slightly lifted, just enough that your pelvis can glide forward and back without sagging. This is your neutral baseline—the position you’ll always return to between every keystroke. Think of it as home base for balance and breath. The stillness here trains your body to feel direction before movement begins.
Inhale through your nose and feel your abdomen fill. As you exhale, let your pelvis tilt slightly downward, not by thrusting but by letting gravity pull the sacrum. This subtle rocking motion connects your breath to your hips and sets your rhythm anchor. When done correctly, the breath feels like a tide moving through the pelvis. For an Ectomorph, the key is containment. Because your frame is lighter, avoid letting your hips drop too far or your spine curve under load. Keep your core slightly active to protect the lumbar area. The longer shaft means that even a small forward drift deepens penetration quickly; keeping hips one inch higher will give you more control.
Now test your range within the shallow 80% depth zone. From the baseline, exhale gently and let your hips glide forward until you feel light pressure against her entrance, then inhale and draw back a few centimeters. Stay shallow and smooth—never snap or jerk. This trains your nervous system to sense depth by pressure, not by sight. Keep the motion small enough that the head never passes the south wall. The purpose is to understand how small your smallest movement can be while still creating sensation. She will feel warmth building without impact, and you’ll feel a subtle suction as the canal adjusts. The best sign you’re aligned is when her breath deepens or her hips settle toward you rather than away.
The plank alignment defines how clearly you can feel her walls. Shift too far forward, and you lose sensitivity in the lower back. Pull too far back, and the connection thins. Stay where the pressure band feels like a taut string between your pelvis and her body. Imagine your spine as a mast and your hips as the sail catching a controlled wind. That wind is breath; it powers every stroke without excess muscle. If your shoulders ache, lower them slightly; if your wrists burn, roll them outward until tension releases. These adjustments maintain joint safety and preserve rhythm integrity.
Reset to neutral baseline after every short cycle. Neutral means the hips float just above contact, spine long, and breath steady. This reset prevents fatigue and recalibrates orientation. Each return to neutral reaffirms depth discipline and keeps your system calm enough to sense micro-responses. If she exhales softly, hold still and match her breath before restarting. If she stiffens or shifts away, pause, back off half an inch, and wait for her body to open again. Control means noticing before adjusting.
A simple journal entry might read: “Neutral plank steady, shallow 80%, Light pressure, hips aligned, deeper breath synced at rep six.” This shorthand keeps your focus on mechanics and body feedback rather than performance. In this phase, the work is not to move more but to feel more. The Egyptian Small Circles depends on a foundation where control, breath, and sensitivity come first. Once that’s in your muscle memory, every rotation later will feel smoother and more accurate.

Module 2 of the Egyptian Small Circles trains each keystroke as a standalone skill so your body learns how to generate precision before chaining them into rhythm. Begin every keystroke from a clean neutral forearm-plank baseline—shoulders stacked, spine level, hips slightly lifted, breath anchored. From here, each motion becomes a deliberate language of Rocking or Angling across the compass of her canal. Think of the body as an instrument tuning itself to clarity; every keystroke fine-tunes one string of sensation.
Start with the Left Hip Lean. Inhale to prepare, then exhale as you drift your left hip a few inches forward and inward. This Angling motion guides the head of your penis toward her right wall within the shallow 80% zone. Pressure starts Light, rises to Medium through the forward arc, and returns to Light as you exhale fully. For an Ectomorph, the motion should come from the lower abs, not from a shoulder push; the lighter frame means less weight is needed to feel contact. With a shaft above seven inches, remain vigilant about depth gating—keep hips slightly elevated so that even at maximum forward lean, you stay comfortably shallow. She will feel a soft lateral pressure like tracing the inside edge of warmth. Watch for cues: a longer breath, hips rolling in, or her body quieting against yours. When those appear, hold that line and breathe through stillness before returning to neutral.
From the baseline, transition into the Right Hip Lean. This movement mirrors the first but reverses the diagonal. Inhale back, then exhale as the right hip glides forward, pointing the head toward her left wall. The effect combines Rocking and Angling, creating a diagonal stroke from north-left to south-center. Pressure remains Light-to-Medium, never pushing through the base. Because of the Ectomorph build, the challenge is maintaining balance—avoid letting the upper torso twist. Keep shoulders even so motion isolates in the pelvis. For longer length, keep the same shallow ceiling; the diagonal sweep provides more wall surface contact without needing extra depth. She may respond with a slow pelvic curl or a breath release. When she does, slow the return and let the breath dictate the reset pace.
Now build into the South-Line Pivot. From neutral, exhale and trace a small clockwise orbit, passing from the right wall through the lower south wall and up toward the left. The pelvis draws the circle; the arms stay stable like pillars. This motion fuses Rocking and Angling seamlessly and expands contact from one wall to the other. Maintain 80% shallow depth on entry, deepen briefly into mid 10% as the orbit passes south, and release to shallow on return. Pressure follows the breath—Medium through the forward-south arc, Light on retraction. The Ectomorph must keep the motion compact; too large a circle risks lower back fatigue. With a longer shaft, control depth by lowering hips only halfway through the south line. She will feel a continuous roll of warmth, and her breathing may sync to yours. If her hips begin to move with you, maintain the tempo and let her set the rhythm for two full breaths before adjusting.
From there, practice the North Return. After completing a clockwise orbit, roll the hips gently upward and slightly backward. This Rocking motion glides the head along her anterior wall toward the north direction. Stay within the shallow zone and lighten pressure to give a sense of lift and relief. This keystroke refreshes circulation and resets rhythm. Inhale through the lift, exhale softly to settle back to neutral. For the Ectomorph, keep spine long and abs engaged to avoid sagging through the midsection. The longer shaft amplifies anterior sensitivity, so even small tilts feel pronounced; keep pressure Light to avoid overstimulation. Her cue will often be a deeper exhale or a slow melting under you. When she relaxes, stay there one breath longer before resuming.
Finally, refine the Micro-Rotation. With hips centered, trace tiny circles driven by your lower abdomen, staying entirely in the shallow 80%. This is pure Angling—no Rocking. The motion is as small as a coin, using breath as the motor. Exhale as you roll, inhale to reset micro-tension. Pressure should remain Light throughout, occasionally testing a Medium touch only if she presses back. The Ectomorph’s advantage is precision; use your lighter load to maintain stability and sustain small, consistent movements without fatigue. The longer length means sensitivity peaks early; keep rotations slow to maintain control. She will feel a concentrated swirl of pressure that builds heat without motion noise. If her hips echo your circles or her breath holds, reduce speed and stay at that depth; that is the SSP cue to maintain rather than change.
Across all keystrokes, the rhythm phase alignment stays clear: the hip leans build Tracking sensitivity, the pivot and return sustain Flow, and the micro-rotation refines Pinning. Practice each keystroke in isolation for one-minute cycles, returning to neutral between every repetition to reset alignment and breath. A simple journal entry might read: “Left lean, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, exhale smooth, hips responded with curl at rep five.” This builds the data your nervous system needs to advance.

===================================================================================================================


Module 3 of the Egyptian Small Circles teaches how to connect the individual keystrokes into a continuous, circular rhythm. The purpose is to train the nervous system to move seamlessly through angles, diagonals, and pressure shifts without losing control or clarity. Begin from a clean neutral forearm-plank baseline—elbows under shoulders, spine long, hips slightly lifted. Feel the breath fill your abdomen on the inhale and ground into your pelvis on the exhale. This rhythm becomes your metronome. Each exhale marks a forward arc, each inhale draws you back to neutral. The sequence you’re building is Left Lean → South-Line Pivot → Right Lean → North Return, flowing in a clockwise loop that becomes the Egyptian Small Circles.
Start the loop by inhaling, steady in plank. As you exhale, initiate the Left Hip Lean, angling the head toward her right wall in the shallow 80%. Feel the Light-to-Medium pressure press and roll along her tissue. Without pausing, breathe in again to draw your hips subtly back to center. On the next exhale, guide the pelvis down and across into the South-Line Pivot, tracing the lower arc of her canal. Pressure rises toward Medium, depth touches mid 10% briefly at the south wall, then returns shallow as you inhale. Keep the circle small—think of the motion as polishing a small stone rather than stirring a pot. This keeps the Ectomorph frame safe and maintains stamina while protecting depth with the longer shaft.
Continue the motion by exhaling into the Right Hip Lean, the mirror image of the first. The head slides diagonally along her left wall with Light-to-Medium pressure, staying shallow and smooth. This phase is where balance matters most; keep shoulders level, let breath guide tempo. Her cues—breath deepening, pelvis curling, or stillness—will tell you when to sustain. Follow her breath with your own; if she holds, slow down. Finally, inhale and draw the hips upward and slightly backward for the North Return. This light Rocking movement glides the head toward her anterior wall, releasing pressure and refreshing the connection. The sequence completes as you exhale back to center and begin again.
The key is linking each keystroke through breath, not muscle. Each exhale drives a diagonal or arc; each inhale restores alignment. Over time, these paired breaths merge into one continuous wave. Practice in sets of ten cycles, returning to full neutral baseline between sets to avoid spinal fatigue. The motion should feel like water rolling through stone—smooth, rhythmic, never forced. The Ectomorph advantage is fine motor control; use it to keep the orbit compact and precise. The longer length amplifies feedback, so even small rotations transmit clearly through her body. This allows you to sense subtle shifts—like when she relaxes her inner muscles or starts to match your tempo.
If she exhales softly or her hips press in, hold the angle at that wall for one breath cycle before resuming. This pause teaches your body to recognize feedback loops that later feed into Flow and Pinning. If her breath shortens or her body tenses, back off half an inch, lighten pressure, and slow down one tempo beat. This keeps safety and comfort constant. The rhythm builds over time: Tracking → Flow → Precision. You’ll feel your abdomen do most of the work while the rest of the body stays quiet. When fatigue appears in the shoulders or wrists, return to neutral, release tension, and reestablish baseline alignment before resuming.
The reflection is simple: The more seamlessly each keystroke links, the less it feels like a movement and the more it feels like a pulse. Egyptian Small Circles is about rotation through containment—power concealed inside precision. When the circle feels continuous and you can track her responses without thinking, the foundation for Flow is complete. A journal note might read: “Full orbit smooth, shallow to mid 10%, Medium pressure, breath sync at rep nine, hips echoed rotation.”

===================================================================================================================
Module 4 of the Egyptian Small Circles develops Tracking—your ability to sense, adjust, and refine the motion in the shallow 80% zone. This is the testing ground for precision. You’re not chasing rhythm yet; you’re collecting data. Start again in the neutral forearm plank, spine long, hips lifted slightly so the pelvis floats over hers. Inhale and feel your abdomen expand, exhale and allow a small forward drift until you feel contact at the shallow depth. From here, use your breath to run mini-sets, each focused on one wall or diagonal, forming and refining hypotheses about how her body reacts to subtle shifts.
Begin by exhaling into the Left Hip Lean, tracing the right wall with Light-to-Medium pressure. Keep movement slow and minimal. Inhale to retreat half an inch and exhale again into the same angle, feeling for texture—how the tissue resists or receives you. Each repetition is an experiment: you’re defining how that wall behaves. For an Ectomorph, the smaller musculature means stability relies on breath rather than brute strength. Keep the core lightly active to protect your lower back. The longer shaft makes even a few millimeters of forward drift amplify pressure; respect that by capping at shallow 80%. Watch her cues—if she exhales softly or her hips follow, note it; if she tightens, lighten touch and slow tempo.
After three or four slow repetitions, reset to neutral baseline. Breathe fully, feel the wrists and shoulders settle, spine long again. Then shift into the Right Hip Lean and repeat the same process on the left wall. This diagonal gives a different resistance pattern—often warmer, more elastic. Inhale to prepare, exhale through the lean, Light-to-Medium pressure. The SSP loop applies: Define the target wall, Hypothesize how it will react, Track the feedback, and Refine your angle or tempo. Each wall will tell you what it prefers. With a longer shaft, clarity comes quickly; use that sensitivity to map the subtle temperature and tone shifts within the canal.
Now test the South-Line Pivot, tracing a gentle orbit through the lower arc. Keep the motion compact—think of the pelvis as drawing a coin-sized circle. Inhale through half the loop, exhale through the return. Medium pressure at the bottom, Light as you rise. Stay entirely in the shallow band. The Ectomorph’s control advantage allows for near-silent movement; this is where you build fine sensory awareness. She may respond with a stilling of breath, a soft hum, or a rolling pelvic pulse. Each cue informs your adjustment: when she opens, stay there and breathe; when she stiffens, back off. The stroke learns you as you learn it.
End each test with the North Return. Exhale as you glide upward along her anterior wall with Light pressure, inhale as you reset to baseline. This creates contrast—the canal feels the difference between forward density and upward release. These alternations sharpen your perception of what each wall contributes to pleasure. Over time, the tracking phase becomes a dialogue of sensation rather than a pattern of thrusts. The goal is to train your awareness to the level where your nervous system anticipates her response before it happens.
For journaling, note discoveries like a scientist rather than a performer: “Right wall shallow, Light pressure, hips pressed in, exhale sync at rep three.” This single line captures what worked and guides the next session’s refinement. In practice, Tracking is about curiosity under control. The Ectomorph body type excels here because low body mass enhances proprioception—use that to detect micro-changes. The longer length demands discipline to stay shallow, but that same reach gives you precise sensory feedback when used correctly.
Tracking ends when every wall feels mapped, when you can name how she reacts at different diagonals without guessing. Once you can shift between them smoothly, your body is ready to evolve from testing to sustained rhythm. Flow is next.

===================================================================================================================


Module 5 of the Egyptian Small Circles moves from precision to Flow—the moment where isolated control becomes rhythmic continuity. You’ll now sustain the full circular pattern through breath-linked motion, maintaining shallow to mid-depth contact with unwavering control. The aim is to stay in the body’s groove without drifting into excess pressure or loss of alignment. Begin in neutral forearm-plank baseline. Shoulders stacked, spine long, hips slightly lifted so weight is balanced between arms and core. Inhale fully, feel the abdomen expand, then exhale to enter the circle. Every orbit begins with breath, not effort.
Start the first loop by exhaling through the Left Hip Lean. The head moves toward her right wall, shallow 80%, pressure Light to Medium. Without pausing, roll through the South-Line Pivot, tracing the lower curve with a brief deepening to mid 10%. Inhale as you rise into the Right Hip Lean, the head sliding toward her left wall, then exhale again to finish the arc into the North Return, gliding up the anterior wall. Let the next inhale carry you back to baseline. This continuous breathing pattern becomes the metronome that holds rhythm together. The Ectomorph’s advantage here is fluidity—your lighter build makes micro-transitions smoother, allowing the longer shaft to trace full walls without heavy drive.
Keep the motion compact. Imagine drawing a slow-moving ring inside her body, one inch wide, looping evenly in both directions. Use the hips as the driver, not the knees. Each rotation should last two full breaths—inhale through the back half, exhale through the forward. The circle remains mostly in the shallow zone, dipping briefly into mid-depth only when her hips invite it by pressing upward or curling in. The longer shaft must be guided by awareness; never push into deep 10% unless her breath opens and her pelvis lifts naturally. Pressure stays Medium at most. Flow depends on containment, not force.
Once rhythm is stable, begin syncing tempo to her breathing patterns. If she lengthens her exhale, extend yours. If her hips start to roll or her thighs widen, use that as a cue to slow slightly and hold pressure where she opens. Flow is mutual adaptation; your role is to read her cues while keeping structure intact. When her breath catches, lighten pressure, shorten the orbit, and let her settle before continuing. Each time you sense overexertion in your core or shoulders, pause, return to baseline, reset the plank, and re-enter with new air. The Flow phase is about sustainability.
You’ll feel your body start to hum as the nervous system locks into repetition. This is where Flow becomes a trance of control—the hips move without conscious thought, guided by sensation alone. For the Ectomorph body, endurance comes from precision, not muscle power. Keep the abs softly active, maintain low-back length, and let breath manage fatigue. Because the shaft exceeds seven inches, depth must always be capped; her canal will respond better to angled surface contact than vertical penetration. Think of the movement as stirring the edges of a glass rather than pushing to the bottom. The effect is deep warmth spreading outward, not friction downward.
When Flow locks in, the pair’s breathing often synchronizes unconsciously. You’ll know you’ve entered this zone when her hips stop searching and begin following. She’ll feel each orbit as a rolling pulse, continuous and soft. The moment you sense that synchronization, stay in it for three or four cycles before deliberately returning to neutral. Flow training ends the same way it begins—with control. Finish by inhaling fully, exhaling to rest hips on heels, releasing arms, and noting sensations in your body.
A journal example might read: “Clockwise flow steady, shallow to mid 10%, Medium pressure, hips synced by cycle four.” Each reflection strengthens awareness of what true Flow feels like. Once you can sustain this rhythm consistently without drift or tension, you’re ready to explore the deeper arc and controlled expansion of depth that follows.

===================================================================================================================
Module 6 of the Egyptian Small Circles teaches controlled deep Flow—the expansion from shallow mastery into safe, deliberate engagement of the mid and deep 10%. This is not about going deeper for intensity’s sake; it’s about learning how to enter depth as a precise layer of stimulation that complements the circle’s surface rhythm. Begin in a clean neutral forearm-plank. Inhale fully, feel the ribs widen, and exhale to settle the pelvis into alignment. Depth work starts here, not inside her—it starts in the discipline of your posture. The Ectomorph frame must rely on core stability to prevent collapse under deeper leverage. The longer shaft magnifies every inch of movement, so depth must be approached like lowering a brush into paint—slow, angled, intentional.
Start the circle shallow, tracing the familiar left-right orbit. Inhale as you prepare, exhale as you guide the hips through the South-Line Pivot. Instead of returning immediately to shallow, allow the pelvis to drop a few millimeters further, shifting the head from mid to deep 10%. Pressure should never exceed Medium. Feel the angle adjust—your hips will tilt slightly upward to maintain contact with the south wall rather than pressing straight into the cervix. The motion remains circular, not vertical. This ensures she feels depth as a spreading warmth low in her abdomen rather than as a sharp internal poke. If she exhales slowly or her thighs relax outward, hold that orbit for two full breaths. If she tenses or lifts her hips defensively, retreat to shallow and start again.
Flow deepening is always paired with lubrication awareness. The deeper you travel, the more friction control matters. Inhale during the upward portion of the circle, exhale through the lower half where depth increases. This breathing keeps pressure stable and oxygenates your core so the motion stays clean. Ectomorphs must rely on breath and glute activation to anchor the pelvis instead of sinking body weight into her. Each deep orbit should feel balanced between lightness and groundedness, like tracing the bottom curve of a bowl without scraping it. The longer shaft creates full contact even at moderate angles; use this to emphasize diagonal glides across the lower canal rather than direct bottoming out.
Alternate between shallow orbits and brief deep dips in three-to-one cycles: three shallow circles for every one that reaches mid-depth. This preserves endurance and keeps her nervous system receptive rather than overwhelmed. The circular motion naturally draws arousal upward, so returning to shallow after each deep round intensifies her internal pulse. Pay attention to partner cues—her hips pressing down, breath deepening, or a soft moan means the deep angle is welcome. A sudden shift, pelvic withdrawal, or breath hold signals to retreat. Respond instantly; mastery means being fluent in her feedback.
The goal of this module is consistency under tension. Your stamina will be tested more here because the longer shaft requires more core control to modulate entry. Keep shoulders stable, elbows planted, spine long. When fatigue sets in, break the rhythm, retreat to baseline, breathe, then resume shallow orbits before reattempting depth. Safety comes from patience. Never increase depth during a single exhale—spread it across two. The deep zone is earned, not taken. When done correctly, she will respond with small involuntary pelvic curls or a low exhale that releases from deep in her body. That’s your confirmation that depth and angle are correct.
When the set feels integrated, end with a few shallow closing circles, using Light pressure to soothe and redistribute sensation. Finish by inhaling fully, resting hips back, and noting the difference in your own internal state—more grounded, slower heart rate, steadier breath. This is the nervous system imprint of controlled deep Flow: calm dominance without strain.
A journal note might read: “South diagonal deep 10%, Medium pressure, hips softened, breath echoed at cycle three.” Once you can maintain this quality safely and repeatably, you’re ready to move into the precision micro-adjustments that generate post-orgasmic reactivation.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for Egyptian Small Circles with Body Type Ectomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


===================================================================================================================


Module 7 of the Egyptian Small Circles focuses on Pinning—the art of holding her in a post-orgasmic trance and reactivating sensitivity through subtle micro-variations in angle, pressure, and tempo. You’re no longer chasing rhythm. You’re sculpting sensation. Every movement here is slow, intentional, and no larger than a fingertip’s shift. The goal is to let her body ride the echo of climax while you use the circle’s geometry to awaken new layers of feeling beneath it. Begin in neutral forearm-plank, grounded but light. Your core should hover, not sink. Shoulders relaxed, wrists aligned under the chest, breath long and steady. Inhale deeply, exhale fully, and re-enter her shallowly, staying in the 80% zone until her breath stabilizes.
As her pulse slows, let the hips draw a half-sized circle through the South-Line Pivot, Medium pressure on the right wall. Inhale through the retreat, exhale through the glide. You’re testing her responsiveness—the post-orgasmic body is hyper-sensitive, and the longer shaft amplifies every micro-angle. Ectomorph structure favors precision; use that gift. Keep your spine long and movement generated from your pelvis rather than your arms. When she exhales with a soft tremor or her hips rise slightly, that’s your cue to maintain the orbit and add a touch more angle. When her breath holds or her legs tense, ease off, exhale, and return to baseline.
Pinning means maintaining presence inside her body while creating just enough change to pull her toward another wave. Rotate clockwise through the left wall for three or four cycles, each one slower than the last. Pressure alternates between Light and Medium—never Hard. The deeper portion of your length should hover near mid 10%, never beyond, to avoid overstimulation. Use breath to pace the transitions: inhale to lift the hips a fraction upward, exhale to glide diagonally down. This gives the circle a rocking texture, a rhythmic pressure pulse that she can melt into. Each subtle adjustment carries the potential to re-ignite contractions.
You’ll know you’ve reached the correct resonance when her body stills instead of moves—when she stops meeting your rhythm and starts vibrating beneath it. That’s the cue to pause, hold the angle, and breathe. The head of your shaft rests against the chosen wall with zero motion, only the pulse of shared breath moving through both bodies. This is the “pin.” Stay there for two or three full breaths. Then resume the smallest orbit—barely perceptible, like the brushing of silk. This oscillation—pause, breathe, move, pause—creates what’s known as post-orgasmic stacking, where the nervous system layers new peaks over fading ones without full reset.
For an Ectomorph body type, joint protection and stamina come from efficiency. Keep the core engaged but soft, elbows steady, and neck aligned with the spine. Avoid pushing with the shoulders. Use your breath as the motion’s engine. Because the longer shaft amplifies sensitivity, depth must remain capped; even a centimeter too far can break the trance. Think of tracing the edges of a wine glass—steady, circular, delicate. Her cues will tell you if you’re in the pocket: subtle pelvic curls, fluttering breath, or a spontaneous moan from the throat. When these appear, stay with that wall and hold pressure constant for two full exhalations before gradually reducing movement to nothing.
End each session by returning to shallow orbiting. This brings both bodies back to baseline without breaking connection. Exhale as you withdraw halfway, inhale as you float the hips back in. This resets both nervous systems, closing the session with calm instead of collapse. Journal one concise reflection such as, “Post-orgasm left wall, shallow orbit, Light pressure, hips stilled at breath three.” This note captures the feedback loop you refined.
Once you can hold her energy in that suspended, quivering state—neither overstimulated nor detached—you’ve mastered Pinning. It’s not about motion; it’s about reading the smallest tremors in her breath and letting them guide your next move.

===================================================================================================================
Module 8 of the Egyptian Small Circles teaches Wave Cycling — the seamless alternation between Flow, Depth, and Pinning without ever breaking internal contact. This is where the circle becomes multidimensional. You’re no longer executing a pattern. You’re orchestrating a nervous system. The Ectomorph’s long frame and precision hips are perfect for this: your control of angle and rhythm lets you cycle intensity while conserving energy.
Start in neutral forearm-plank. Inhale fully, feel your abdomen expand. Exhale, enter shallow at 80%. Begin a few slow clockwise circles — Light pressure, shallow depth. This reestablishes Flow. Let your breath dictate tempo: inhale for half the orbit, exhale for the other. Once the rhythm feels effortless, introduce Depth Phase: on your next exhale, sink the hips diagonally through the South-Line Pivot to mid 10%, adding only Medium pressure. Hold for one breath, then inhale to rise back into shallow orbit. Repeat three shallow to one deep. This cycle teaches your body to glide between arousal layers without losing composure.
After three or four depth cycles, shift into Pinning Phase. Choose the wall that gave her the strongest response — left or right — and pause there. Maintain Light pressure, zero motion, two full breaths. Then start a micro-circle no larger than a fingertip’s width. Stay at mid 10% if her breath opens; return to shallow if she tightens. The goal is continuity — no abrupt entries or exits. Your breath must remain the same no matter how deep or still you are. That steadiness is what her nervous system entrains to.
Now begin the full Wave Cycle: Flow (3–4 shallow circles) → Depth (1 diagonal deep orbit) → Pin (2-breath stillness). Repeat this sequence five to seven times. The body will start producing automatic contractions during the transitions, especially after the second or third cycle. The deeper the relaxation, the more pronounced these waves become. Your task is to surf them — stay present, keep angle stable, and let her nervous system do the work. For an Ectomorph with a longer shaft, restraint is key: deep entries should feel like pressure gradients, not thrusts. The hips move as a single unit, pivoting from the sacrum, never from the knees.
Notice how the circles begin to feel self-sustaining — like the motion is happening through you rather than by you. That’s the essence of Wave Cycling. When you hit this state, her breath will sync with yours unconsciously. Every inhale she takes expands her pelvis slightly; every exhale releases into your orbit. You’re creating a shared rhythm that blurs the line between stimulus and response. This is how multiple orgasms emerge naturally — by holding her nervous system on the edge of activation and rest without breaking the circuit.
Maintain this dance for five minutes at most during training. Overstimulation dulls awareness. When you sense the wave subsiding — her body softening, breathing slowing — finish with three shallow Flow circles and a full exhale as you withdraw halfway. Rest hips on heels, palms flat, breathing slow. Feel the residual pulse between your legs. That hum is neuromuscular coherence — the sign that you’ve mastered control under changing intensity.
A sample journal tag: “Wave Cycle 3:3:2, South diagonal, Medium pressure, breath sync achieved.”
Once you can execute three full Wave Cycles with steady breath, you’re ready to enter the next phase: Energetic Overlay, where physical circles become conduits for transferring charge and emotion through the pelvic field.
