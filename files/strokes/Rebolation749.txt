Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the first step of your transformational journey with the Rebloation Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m here to guide you through a program crafted specifically for ectomorphs with an extension between 5 and 7 inches. Your body is built for speed and agility—lean and responsive, allowing you to perform with remarkable precision. Even though your asset is moderate in length, every single inch holds significant sensitivity when you learn to leverage it properly. Today, we’re going to convert your natural quickness and refined motor control into the Rebloation Stroke—a technique that relies on a series of sequential hip rotations designed to build cumulative, targeted stimulation.
Imagine stepping into your training space—a private sanctuary free from distractions where every focus is on mastering your technique. Feel the steady, supportive ground beneath your feet; it reflects the rock‑solid base of your ectomorphic physique. Take several deep, purposeful breaths; as you inhale, fill your body with concentrated energy, and as you exhale, feel your tension melt away. This is your arena, brother—a space to take your raw potential and sculpt it into a performance that delivers precise cumulative pleasure.
We start by adapting the classic missionary position to suit your lean, agile build. Assume a modified plank with your knees resting comfortably on the surface. This position is essential because it anchors your entire body, ensuring that every micro‑movement—from the subtle rotation of your hips to the final lateral shift—occurs with deliberate precision. Your ectomorphic frame enables quick, exact movements, but with your moderate extension, it’s crucial that every rotation is executed with deliberate control, so your force is focused in the right areas without overwhelming her sensitive zones.
Once you’re securely positioned, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Think of this deliberate insertion as the blueprint for your entire stroke—it establishes the precise angles and pressure points required for every subsequent move. Your journey then unfolds in a structured sequence: you perform four individual hip rotations to the right, followed by four individual hip rotations to the left, and then you finish with an additional lateral shift to the left. With each individual hip rotation, the hilt of your penis applies steady pressure as it “canvasses” the vaginal opening, while the head of your penis adjusts—first pointing toward one wall and then shifting to the other—building stimulation cumulatively with every turn.
This introduction lays the foundation, brother. It shows you how to set up your environment, adopt the proper posture, and channel your natural ectomorphic agility and moderate extension into a Rebloation Stroke that transforms rapid, sequential hip rotations into cumulative, controlled stimulation. Welcome, brother—your journey to mastering this precise art form begins now.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, and Flow
Alright, brother, let’s dive deep into the principles that underpin the Rebloation Stroke. This module explains the 80‑10‑10 principle, the Sexual Scientific Process with tracking and flow, and how these methods guide you toward perfecting your stroke technique for maximum cumulative pleasure.
Imagine the 80‑10‑10 principle as your force‑distribution blueprint. Essentially, about 80% of the stimulation you deliver should be focused on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because that area boasts the highest concentration of nerve endings. This is where the bulk of the pleasure originates. The remaining 20% of your force is split evenly, with 10% dedicated to the mid‑depth zone (approximately 3 to 5 inches) and 10% to the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an ectomorph with a moderate extension, this means that while your swift, dynamic movements allow you to reach deeper, the majority of your applied force must always target that ultra‑sensitive shallow region. This careful distribution ensures that the stimulation builds gradually and cumulatively without overloading a single area.
Now, let’s explore the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic, data-driven method to refine your technique. It starts with clearly defining your goal. For the Rebloation Stroke, your objective might be to maximize the cumulative effect of each individual hip rotation. With your goal set, you form a hypothesis. Perhaps you suspect that a slightly slower rotation angle will yield a more intense build-up of stimulation. Next comes tracking. In tracking, you perform roughly 30 repetitions on each “wall” (or sector) of your partner’s vaginal canal. During this phase, you pay attention to your own physical cues—ensuring your core is engaged and your pelvic floor is activated—and, most importantly, you carefully listen to her responses. Her deep, rhythmic breathing, subtle body shifts, and soft verbal cues provide the critical data you need to determine which movements deliver the most cumulative pleasure. This immediate feedback loop allows you to fine-tune your technique in real time.
Once you’ve gathered enough data from tracking, you enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical state where every micro‑movement—from your smooth forward push to each precise hip rotation—occurs automatically, seamlessly, and with perfect rhythm. In flow, you no longer have to think consciously about each movement; your body simply performs them with the exact pressure and timing that tracking has honed, allowing cumulative stimulation to build effortlessly with every stroke cycle.
Training the keystrokes in the Rebloation Stroke isn’t about separate drills like tap keystrokes; it’s about drilling the core movements—each individual hip rotation—until they become second nature. By isolating and repeatedly practicing those rotations (both to the right and the left), you develop the muscle memory essential for a perfectly executed, cumulative stroke.
So, to recap, brother: the 80‑10‑10 principle directs 80% of your force to the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone with 10% each for the mid‑depth and deep layers; the Sexual Scientific Process uses clear goal setting, hypothesis formation, rigorous tracking, and the natural state of flow to continually refine your technique; and by isolating and drilling the individual hip rotations as your core keystrokes, you ensure that every component of the Rebloation Stroke works together to build cumulative stimulation. This comprehensive understanding is the foundation upon which you develop your flawless performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Rebloation Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Rebloation Stroke step by step so that you have an exact blueprint to transform your ectomorphic agility and compact extension into cumulative, targeted stimulation. The Rebloation Stroke is performed in the classic missionary position—with you on top in a modified plank, knees planted firmly on the canvas, and your penis inserted at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Once inserted, the stroke unfolds in a clear, sequential pattern: you perform four individual hip rotations to the right, then four individual hip rotations to the left, and finish with a lateral shift to the left to round out the sequence.
Begin with the forward push—the foundation of your stroke. From your securely anchored position, drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head in a smooth, deliberate motion. Feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region while the head remains in steady contact with her “south wall.” Since your extension is below 5 inches, the 80‑10‑10 principle guides you: approximately 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), with the remaining 20% evenly distributed between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This forward push sets the stage, providing the cumulative base upon which all subsequent rotations will build stimulation.
Next comes the first phase of the directional segment. You begin with four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation to the right, focus on how the hilt of your penis applies steady pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening down to the south‑eastern segment. Simultaneously, the head of your penis shifts its focus—it first points toward the southwestern wall and then gradually transitions to the north‑western wall. Each rotation is a distinct keystroke that adds a precise layer of cumulative stimulation.
Following the right rotations, you transition to the second phase: four individual hip rotations to the left. This phase is a mirror image of the previous one. As you rotate your hips to the left, the hilt of your penis now canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head initially directs its pressure toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall. This alternation between right and left rotations creates a rhythmic, balanced pattern that ensures cumulative stimulation is built evenly across her vaginal opening.
Finally, after you’ve completed these rotations, the stroke concludes with one lateral shift to the left. This additional movement helps to further distribute the cumulative stimulation, ensuring that every aspect of her canal is engaged. At each step, you must always abide by the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, sensitive zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly split to provide a balanced, cumulative touch deep within.
This detailed deconstruction offers you a precise, step-by-step roadmap for the Rebloation Stroke. It transforms your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension into a series of meticulously coordinated movements that build cumulative, targeted stimulation through sequential hip rotations and a final lateral shift.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now we’re going to drill each individual component of the Rebloation Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with flawless precision. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, you’re built for rapid, precise actions—but every hip rotation must be controlled with laser accuracy. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and practice it repeatedly until it’s completely ingrained in your muscle memory, ensuring every movement adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Begin with the forward push drill. In your modified missionary position, with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that supports your lean frame, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Slowly execute a forward push toward your partner’s head, focusing on a smooth, deliberate motion. Feel the top shelf of your extension glide softly over her clitoral region as the head remains in constant contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is compact, ensure that about 80% of your force is directed at the shallow, nerve‑rich area. Drill this move slowly and consistently until the forward push is perfectly smooth and automatic.
Next, isolate the hip rotation drills. Start with a single rotation to the right. From your starting position, initiate one deliberate hip rotation to the right. As you rotate, focus intently on the hilt of your penis as it canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, note how the head first points toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall. Perform one complete rotation slowly, then pause, reset, and repeat this movement for at least 30 repetitions until you develop precise muscle memory. Next, isolate and drill a single hip rotation to the left. As you rotate to the left, let the hilt canvas from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head initially directs its pressure toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. Repeat for at least 30 repetitions until the left rotation feels just as natural and controlled as the right.
After you’ve refined the individual hip rotations, practice the final lateral shift. This is the key movement that rounds out the Rebloation Stroke. Slowly move your body laterally to the left, ensuring that the force you apply remains consistent with the 80‑10‑10 principle—where about 80% of your force is still targeted at the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone. Drill this lateral shift repeatedly until the transition feels smooth and synchronized with your hip rotations.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing. Each deep inhale provides the energy needed for the next precise move, and every measured exhale ensures a smooth transition between movements. Although the Rebloation Stroke doesn’t incorporate a separate tap keystroke drill, the focus here is on drilling every component—each forward push, every hip rotation, and the concluding lateral shift—until they’re fully ingrained in your muscle memory and executed with cumulative precision.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to synthesize all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Rebloation Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance, with your knees planted firmly on the canvas, your core engaged, and your focus solely on linking every micro‑movement into an uninterrupted, rhythmic cycle. In this integrated sequence, you’ll combine your smooth forward push with four individual hip rotations to the right, four individual hip rotations to the left, and a final lateral shift to complete the stroke.
Begin with the forward push. From your secure base, insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle, and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide effortlessly over her clitoral region, while the head maintains continuous, intentional contact with her “south wall.” This forward push sets the foundation, ensuring that, in accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle, about 80% of your force is devoted to the shallow, sensitive zone.
Immediately following the forward push, initiate the first phase of the stroke: four precise hip rotations to the right. With each rotation, focus on the hilt delivering steady pressure by canvassing from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head shifts from pointing toward the southwestern wall to directing its pressure toward the north‑western wall. These rotations are performed sequentially, with each one adding a layer of targeted stimulation.
After completing the four right rotations, seamlessly transition into the next phase: four individual hip rotations to the left. As you rotate left, feel the hilt gradually move from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head first directs its force toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. This balanced, alternating pattern ensures that cumulative stimulation is evenly applied across her vaginal canal.
Finally, complete the integrated sequence with one lateral shift to the left. This final movement reinforces the cumulative effect, ensuring that every area of her canal receives the precise stimulation built through your rotations. Throughout this entire process, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing to serve as your internal metronome—every deep inhale fuels your next move, and every controlled exhale eases the transitions between the forward push, hip rotations, and lateral shift.
By integrating these components into one fluid sequence, your Rebloation Stroke becomes a continuous, rhythmic performance that leverages your lean, agile ectomorphic qualities and compact extension. This seamless integration not only maximizes cumulative stimulation but also creates a performance that is as intuitive as it is intense—a true expression of precision and cumulative pleasure.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where every micro‑movement of your Rebloation Stroke is refined until your performance becomes a flawlessly executed masterpiece. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, every detail is crucial—particularly during those individual hip rotations. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains your guiding star, ensuring that around 80% of your applied force targets the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone, with the remaining 20% evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you perform your integrated sequence, focus intently on the quality and consistency of each move. During your forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains steady, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When executing your four right and four left hip rotations, observe carefully how the hilt canvasses the vaginal opening and how the head shifts with each rotation—first pressing toward one wall, then transitioning to the opposite wall. This is where tracking becomes indispensable. For each repetition, listen closely to her deep, rhythmic breathing; notice any subtle changes in her posture; and be alert for soft verbal cues that reveal which elements of your stroke are delivering the most cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your feedback loop—it lets you fine-tune your technique in real time, adjusting your speed, angle, and force to optimize each movement.
Once you’ve gathered sufficient data—ideally about 30 repetitions per directional phase—you naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical condition where every micro‑movement—from your forward push to each meticulously executed hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically, in perfect rhythm. In flow, you deliver precisely the pressure and timing that tracking has helped you optimize, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with every cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is essential during this phase: every deep inhale prepares you for the next precise movement, and every deliberate exhale smooths out transitions. If any rotation or lateral shift seems slightly off, pause, re-track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is impeccable.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training program crafted to reinforce every element of your Rebloation Stroke while strengthening your core and overall stability. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, your natural speed and precision are your primary assets. This routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that delivers cumulative, targeted stimulation with every stroke.
Begin by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary free of distractions where your sole focus is honing your technique. Every session should start with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your ectomorphic body. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these muscle groups form the foundation of your stability and control, ensuring that every micro‑movement is executed with perfect accuracy. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine and priming every muscle and joint for the fast-paced, precise drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a determined, positive tone.
Next, move into your specialized drills. Begin with the forward push drill. In your modified missionary position, insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and practice a smooth, deliberate forward push toward your partner’s head. Ensure that about 80% of your force goes to the shallow, sensitive zone. Then, drill your individual hip rotations. Isolate the right rotations first—practice each rotation slowly and with complete control until the hilt consistently canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment while the head shifts from the southwestern to the north‑western wall. Repeat for at least 30 reps until it becomes second nature, then mirror the process for the left rotations. Finally, drill the final lateral shift that completes the stroke, ensuring it blends seamlessly with the rotations. Alternate these drills until every keystroke of your Rebloation Stroke is fully ingrained in your muscle memory.
Throughout your practice, maintain deep, controlled breathing to support every movement. Supplement your drills with targeted core-strengthening exercises like planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability workouts—your strong core is the anchor for all your movements. And finally, keep a detailed training journal. Record every session, document the number of repetitions, note any adjustments you make, and capture her feedback. This journal is a vital part of the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to track your progress and refine your technique until it’s perfect.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—the pinnacle of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Rebloation Stroke converges into one continuous, seamless performance. In this final module, your lean, agile ectomorphic build and your compact extension come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of mastery that is both scientifically refined and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified missionary stance—with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core fully engaged, and your mind honed on precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is delivered to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone while the remaining force is meticulously balanced across the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately after the forward push, transition into the hip rotation phase by executing four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation, focus on the hilt applying steady, consistent pressure—canvassing from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment—while the head first directs its stimulation toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall. Then, seamlessly transition into four individual rotations to the left. As you rotate to the left, have the hilt canalize pressure from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, with the head shifting from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall. Finally, complete the sequence with one controlled lateral shift to the left to round out the cumulative stimulation. Throughout the entire sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each inhale fueling the next precise movement and each exhale smoothing the transitions.
If any aspect of your performance seems off—if a rotation isn’t quite precise or the pressure distribution feels unbalanced—pause, re-track her feedback, and make micro-adjustments until your technique is flawless. The ultimate goal is to reach a state of natural flow—a condition where every forward push, every hip rotation, and every lateral shift occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When that state is achieved, your Rebloation Stroke will have evolved into a seamless, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers the targeted, cumulative stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance where every forward push, every individual hip rotation, and every lateral shift is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your lean, agile ectomorphic build and compact extension will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Rebloation Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure every time.
