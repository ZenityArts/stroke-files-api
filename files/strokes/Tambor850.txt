Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Tambor Stroke—a dynamic full‑body technique specifically engineered for endomorphs with an extended asset above 7 inches. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to guide you through this program that’s been finely tuned to your robust, full‑figured build. Your structure is built for power, endurance, and stability. With your extended asset, you’ve got exceptional reach and a deep well of sensitivity that, when harnessed correctly, can deliver cumulative, intense stimulation. Today, we’re going to learn how to transform that raw power into a meticulously controlled, rapid Tambor Stroke that fuses swift hip rotations with deliberate force allocation.
Picture yourself stepping into your personal training space—a quiet, distraction‑free sanctuary where your full focus is on perfecting your technique. Feel the solid, supportive floor beneath your feet, a reflection of the unshakeable stability of your endomorphic build. Take a few deep, deliberate breaths; with each inhale, draw in concentrated energy, and with each exhale, release all tension. This training space is your arena, brother—a place to turn your natural, robust potential into a masterful performance that yields cumulative, targeted pleasure.
We begin by adapting the classic missionary position to suit your powerful frame. Assume a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a sturdy surface engineered to support your weight and your formidable endurance. This foundational stance is absolutely crucial—it anchors your body so that every micro‑movement, from the subtle shift of your hips to the swift, rapid rotations, is executed with deliberate control and precision. Your robust, full‑figured form provides an unyielding core; however, with an extended asset above 7 inches, every movement must be carefully calibrated so that your immense force is directed with precision and doesn’t overwhelm her delicate, nerve‑rich areas.
Once you're perfectly anchored, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Think of this deliberate insertion as your blueprint—it sets the exact angles and pressure points that will guide every subsequent movement in your Tambor Stroke. Your journey begins with a smooth, deliberate forward push. As you drive your entire body forward toward her head, feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide elegantly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, you have the reach to deliver deeper stimulation, but it’s critical that you apply about 80% of your force to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone (the first 1–3 inches) and evenly distribute the remaining 20% between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This is the essence of the 80‑10‑10 principle—a method that ensures every push builds cumulative, balanced stimulation.
Once that foundational forward push is complete, the Tambor Stroke enters its signature phase. Here, you have the choice to operate the stroke in one of two directional modes—going right or going left—each of which uses fast‑paced hip rotations to generate dynamic, rapid stimulation. In “Tambor going right,” you execute fast‑paced hip rotations to the right: as you rotate, the hilt of your penis applies pressure and canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head of your penis quickly points toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall. In “Tambor going left,” the process is mirrored: the hilt applies pressure and canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, with the head first pointing toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. These rapid rotations, executed with your powerful, endomorphic frame, must be controlled so that cumulative stimulation is built effectively, even as your forceful movements remain precisely focused.
This introduction lays the foundation, brother. It shows you how to establish your training environment, set your posture, and channel your robust endomorphic power and extended asset into a Tambor Stroke that converts raw force into a carefully choreographed performance. Welcome, brother—today we begin turning your natural potential into an intimate masterpiece.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Alright, brother, let’s break down the technical principles that power your Tambor Stroke. This module is where the science of your movement meets the art of stimulation, ensuring every action is deliberate and cumulative.
First, the 80‑10‑10 principle is your force-distribution blueprint. Visualize this: about 80% of the force you generate should be concentrated on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because that’s where the highest density of nerve endings is, making it extremely sensitive. The remaining 20% of your force is divided evenly; 10% targets the mid‑depth zone (roughly 3 to 5 inches) and 10% engages the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an ectomorph with an extended asset above 7 inches, you have remarkable agility and reach; but in this program for endomorphs with an extension in the 5‑7‑inch range, every move is tailored for robust control. With your substantial frame, you generate high force naturally, so you must channel most of that power to the ultra‑sensitive shallow area while still balancing the deeper touch for cumulative, gentle stimulation.
Next is the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic, iterative method for perfecting your technique. It begins with clearly defining your goal; for example, you might want to maximize the intensity of your fast-paced hip rotations or fine-tune the power during your double down movements. With that goal in place, you form a hypothesis—for instance, you may suspect that a slightly more deliberate rotation angle will enhance cumulative stimulation. Then comes tracking. In the tracking phase, you perform around 30 repetitions for each directional movement, carefully monitoring your body’s cues (ensuring your core is fully engaged and your pelvic floor is strong) and, most importantly, listening to her responses. Listen to her deep, rhythmic breathing, note subtle shifts in her posture, and capture any soft verbal cues. Tracking is your immediate feedback loop; it tells you exactly which aspects of your stroke are most effective so you can adjust your technique in real time.
Once sufficient data is gathered through tracking, you transition into a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical state where every micro‑movement—from your forward push to each rapid hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically, like a perfectly choreographed dance. In flow, you no longer have to consciously control every single detail; your body naturally delivers the precise pressure and timing that tracking has honed, building cumulative stimulation effortlessly with each repetition.
Finally, let’s cover the tap keystroke drill—a critical exercise for honing your lateral precision. Picture yourself in a stable forearm plank; then, slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, and return smoothly to center. Though it appears simple, this drill builds the muscle memory and pelvic strength necessary for executing every lateral movement with pinpoint accuracy. When practiced with deep, controlled “stroke breathing” and integrated with kegeling exercises, the tap keystroke drill ensures that every lateral shift adheres flawlessly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
So, brother, to sum it up: the 80‑10‑10 principle directs 80% of your force to the shallow, ultra-sensitive zone and the remaining 20% is split evenly between the mid‑depth and deep layers; the Sexual Scientific Process—through clear goal-setting, hypothesis formation, tracking, and entering flow—allows you to refine and perfect your technique; and the tap keystroke drill sharpens your lateral precision. With these core principles firmly in place, you’re well-equipped to break down and master the Tambor Stroke with explosive, cumulative precision.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Tambor Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Tambor Stroke step by step so you have an exact blueprint for converting your raw power into rapid, cumulative stimulation. The Tambor is performed in the classic missionary position—your body on top in a modified plank (knees on the canvas) and your penis inserted at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Once inserted, you have the option to operate the stroke in one of two modes: going right or going left. Each mode employs fast-paced hip rotations to generate quick, dynamic stimulation.
Start with the forward push. From your secure base, drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head with a smooth, deliberate push. Feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Since your extension falls in the 5‑7‑inch range, the 80‑10‑10 principle commands that around 80% of your force is directed at the shallow, highly sensitive zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), with the remaining 20% evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This forward push is the foundation upon which cumulative stimulation is built.
Now, let’s explore the directional phase. In “Tambor going right,” you perform fast-paced hip rotations to the right. As you rapidly rotate, the hilt of your penis applies pressure and canvasses the vaginal opening from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment. Simultaneously, the head swiftly points toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall, delivering dynamic, rapid stimulation. Conversely, in “Tambor going left,” the process is mirrored: the hilt applies pressure and canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head initially points toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall. These rapid rotations are designed to build cumulative stimulation quickly while ensuring precision according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Training the Tambor Stroke means isolating these keystrokes and drilling them until each becomes second nature. Begin with the forward push drill—practice it until your movement is smooth, controlled, and perfectly consistent. Then, drill the fast-paced hip rotations individually. For “going right,” focus on performing rapid rotations where the hilt correctly canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment and the head moves seamlessly from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. Next, practice the “going left” rotations, mirroring the process with exact precision. Alternate these drills until you can execute each rapid movement while strictly maintaining the 80‑10‑10 force distribution. Each keystroke—the forward push and each quick hip rotation—builds the foundation for a cumulative, targeted Tambor Stroke.
This deconstruction provides you with a detailed roadmap: every forward push, every fast-paced rotation, whether right or left, is designed to contribute to cumulative, balanced stimulation. It transforms your natural ectomorphic agility and extended reach into a precisely controlled performance that delivers rapid, intense pleasure.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each component of the Tambor Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with flawless speed and precision. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you’re built for quick, rapid movements—but every fast-paced rotation must be controlled with exacting precision. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and repeat it until it is fully ingrained in your muscle memory, while always adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle and the corrected hip rotation details.
Begin with the forward push drill. In your modified missionary position with your knees firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface, insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly perform a forward push toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation—the top shelf of your extended asset should glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because you’re working with an extension between 5 and 7 inches, direct approximately 80% of your force to the shallow, nerve‑rich area. Perform this forward push slowly and consistently until the movement is smooth and perfect.
Next, move on to your lateral shift drills for the directional hip rotations. Begin with a right lateral shift drill. From your forward push position, shift your body to the right in a deliberate, controlled manner. Concentrate on even weight distribution: feel your hilt apply steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening as your shaft rotates to deliver broad, rhythmic pressure toward her left wall. While executing this shift, integrate the correct hip rotations—perform 2 slow rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment, while the head rapidly points first toward the southwestern wall then shifts to the north‑western wall. Drill this movement until it becomes second nature.
Then, practice a left lateral shift drill. Slowly shift your entire body to the left, making sure that your hilt applies consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your shaft rotates to target her right wall. As you execute this left shift, incorporate 2 slow hip rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, with the head initially directed toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. Alternate these drills until you can transition seamlessly between right and left with the 80‑10‑10 force distribution fully intact.
Now, add the “double down” element to further intensify the stimulation. On the right side, after completing a standard right shift, lower your body further in a controlled, deliberate manner to execute a right double down. Focus on amplifying the pressure—feel your hilt apply additional, concentrated force to the right side while your shaft continues its broad, cumulative massage toward her left wall. Drill this double down until you have complete control. Then mirror this drill on the left side—execute a left shift followed by a left double down, ensuring both sides deliver equal cumulative stimulation. Repeat each drill for at least 30 repetitions until every micro‑movement is fully ingrained in your muscle memory.
Throughout all drills, maintain deep, controlled breathing. Each deep inhale supplies the energy for the next precise movement, and every deliberate exhale enables smooth transitions. Additionally, integrate the tap keystroke drill into your training regimen: assume a stable forearm plank, then slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the surface before returning to center. This drill hones your lateral precision and ensures every movement stays true to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to synthesize all the components into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Tambor Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your focus entirely on linking every micro‑movement into a rhythmic, uninterrupted cycle. In this integrated sequence, you’ll combine your deliberate forward push with your fast-paced hip rotations and dynamic lateral shifts to create a stroke that delivers rapid, cumulative stimulation.
Begin with a deliberate forward push. Insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head stays in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push lays the foundation, strictly adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle by focusing about 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone.
Immediately after the forward push, choose your directional mode. If you opt for “Tambor going right,” transition into fast-paced hip rotations to the right. Execute rapid, controlled rotations: feel the hilt apply pressure while canvassing from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, with the head swiftly moving from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. Alternatively, if you prefer “Tambor going left,” perform the mirrored rotations—with the hilt canvassing from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and the head shifting from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall. These fast-paced rotations must always maintain the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that the majority of your force remains on the shallow zone, with the remainder evenly balanced for cumulative stimulation.
Throughout the integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale fuels your rapid movements and every controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions between the forward push and the rapid hip rotations. With every complete cycle, your Tambor Stroke transforms into a continuous, fluid performance that harnesses your natural ectomorphic agility and extended reach into a precisely executed display of rapid, cumulative stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where we refine every micro‑movement of your Tambor Stroke until your performance becomes a flawlessly executed masterpiece of rapid, cumulative stimulation. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, every detail is critical—especially during those fast-paced hip rotations. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains your steadfast guide: approximately 80% of your force must target the shallow, nerve‑rich zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly distributed between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you perform your integrated cycle, focus on the quality and consistency of every move. During your forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your extended asset glides effortlessly over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When executing your rapid hip rotations—whether operating to the right or left—observe carefully how the hilt and head distribute pressure along her vaginal walls. This is where tracking becomes indispensable; each repetition offers immediate, real-time feedback. Listen closely for her deep, rhythmic breathing, notice subtle changes in her posture, and be highly attuned to any soft verbal cues that indicate which elements of your stroke are most effective in building cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your feedback loop that lets you adjust your technique precisely.
Once you’ve gathered enough data—aim for about 30 repetitions per directional mode—you’ll naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that nearly magical state where every micro‑movement, from your forward push to each rapid hip rotation, occurs seamlessly and automatically in perfect rhythm. In flow, you consistently deliver the exact pressure and timing that tracking has fine-tuned, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with each cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is key: each deep inhale primes you for the next rapid movement and every deliberate exhale ensures smooth transitions. And if any lateral shift or rotational movement seems slightly off, pause, track her feedback, and make small, precise adjustments until your technique is flawless.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a disciplined, structured training program designed to reinforce every element of your Tambor Stroke while also strengthening your core and overall stability. With your naturally agile ectomorphic build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, your speed, precision, and extended reach are your greatest assets. This routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that consistently delivers rapid, cumulative stimulation.
Begin by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are eliminated and your focus is entirely on perfecting your technique. Every training session should start with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your ectomorphic structure. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these are the foundation of your stability and control, ensuring that every micro‑movement is executed with precision. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, priming every muscle and joint for the high-speed drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a determined, positive tone for your session.
Next, move into specialized drills, beginning with the tap keystroke drill. Assume your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that supports your lean, agile frame. Practice controlled lateral taps: slowly shift your body laterally until your hip gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. With your extension between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Synchronize each shift with deep, deliberate breathing—inhaling deeply before each lateral movement and exhaling slowly as you return. Integrate kegeling exercises with each repetition to further strengthen your pelvic floor and enhance control. Aim for at least 30 precise repetitions per side until the tap keystroke drill becomes second nature.
Once you’ve mastered the tap keystroke, integrate it with your forward push and rapid hip rotation drills. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by drills for fast-paced hip rotations in your chosen directional mode (right or left). Focus on executing these rapid rotations with both speed and precise control—the hilt must correctly canvas the appropriate vaginal segment (north‑eastern to south‑eastern for right rotations or north‑western to south‑western for left rotations), and the head must shift accurately (from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall for right rotations, or from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall for left rotations). Drill these combined movements repeatedly until every transition is smooth and your technique consistently adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Supplement your training with targeted core-strengthening exercises—such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills—since your core is the anchor that guarantees every move is executed with maximum precision. Finally, maintain a detailed training journal where you record each session, note the number of repetitions, document any adjustments, and capture her feedback. This journal is a vital element of the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to track your progress and continually refine your technique until perfection is achieved.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—the pinnacle of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Tambor Stroke converges into one continuous, seamless performance. In this final module, your lean, agile ectomorphic build and your extension between 5 and 7 inches come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of intimate mastery that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position in your modified plank—with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core deeply engaged, and your mind honed for precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains continuous, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must adhere rigorously to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that about 80% of your force is dedicated to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone while the remaining 20% is meticulously balanced to stimulate the deeper layers.
Immediately, transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your chosen hip. Slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, then return smoothly to center. Focus intently on the sensation—observe how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening, and watch as your shaft rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. Integrate the correct hip rotation details here: if shifting to the left, perform 2 slow rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment (with the head moving from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall); if shifting to the right, execute 2 slow rotations where the hilt moves from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment (with the head transitioning from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall). If any lateral movement appears off—if the pressure isn’t perfectly balanced or the angle requires a slight tweak—pause, isolate that movement, and drill it until both your internal cues and her feedback confirm perfection.
Then, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you push upward, contract your core, engage your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for her responses; her deep, steady breathing and any soft, affirming cues will tell you if you’re delivering the optimal stimulation. If you sense that the cumulative effect isn’t quite at its peak, make small, mindful adjustments—tweaking your lateral angle or the pace of your forward push—and carefully track these modifications using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your adjustments, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps with correct hip rotations, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly in a rhythmic, unified performance. Then mirror this complete cycle on the opposite side, ensuring that balanced, cumulative stimulation is delivered throughout her entire vaginal canal. The ultimate goal is to reach a state of natural flow—a condition where every movement occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve this state, your Tambor Stroke will transform into a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers the precise, focused stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every rapid hip rotation, every lateral shift, and every precise adjustment is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and your extension between 5 and 7 inches will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Tambor Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Tambor Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
