Module 1 of The Egyptian Orbiting Circles introduces the foundation that makes every later movement precise, safe, and repeatable. The purpose here is to build full-body alignment and breath rhythm inside the forearm-plank posture, creating the stable base that lets the hips move freely while keeping pressure measured and deliberate. Begin by entering the plank with knees grounded and forearms parallel under the shoulders. The back should form one long plane from crown to tailbone. Let your pelvis hang low enough for the shaft to align naturally toward her south wall without strain in the lumbar spine. Inhale to lengthen the spine; exhale to settle the hips until they hover just above contact. For a Mesomorph, whose muscle density can create stiffness in the lower chain, focus on length instead of force. Keep weight evenly spread across elbows and knees to protect joint load. For a penis below five inches, maintaining the downward diagonal is key for wall contact—too horizontal and you lose traction, too steep and you slip out. Neutral baseline means no forward drive, no pelvic tuck yet—just steady suspension and quiet breath.
Once alignment feels stable, bring awareness to how your forearms and core share the work. The forearms press lightly into the canvas as your abdomen draws upward to keep your chest from collapsing. The shoulders stay broad and the neck long, preventing the kind of hunch that shortens the orbit path later. Inhale to fill the ribs, exhale to let the hips settle one inch lower. This breath pattern sets the cadence you will keep throughout the stroke—inhale to prepare, exhale through movement, inhale to recover. Imagine this stage as tuning a bowstring: tension without tightness. For a Mesomorph, this calibration reduces fatigue and keeps the motion smooth rather than jerky.
From this baseline, begin exploring micro Rocking in the pelvis—gentle forward and back shifts no more than a finger’s width. This teaches balance between the north and south axes and introduces the feel of shallow 80% depth control. Inhale back, exhale forward, keeping pressure Light to Medium. The head of the penis should stay within her entrance, painting shallow arcs without losing contact. When she exhales or her hips drift forward, that is the cue that the wall engagement is clear. If her breath catches or her hips pull away, reduce pressure and shorten range until her body relaxes again. Think of this as testing the suspension of a bridge before driving across—it must move slightly without collapsing.
After Rocking feels controlled, integrate light Angling. Roll one hip an inch forward while the other stays steady, tracing a tiny diagonal toward her left or right wall. These are the seeds of the orbital motion. The action remains shallow, under 80% depth, with pressure at Light to Medium. The goal is to sense how the canal shape shifts subtly as you redirect the angle. For a Mesomorph, avoid forcing rotation with the glutes; use the obliques to steer. For shorter length, this precision keeps the head of the penis anchored and prevents slippage during side arcs. Always return to neutral after each micro rotation—hips centered, breath reset, body quiet.
During practice, monitor joint load. Forearms should bear only half of body weight; the core carries the rest. Shoulders must remain over elbows, not drifting forward, to avoid strain. Keep your gaze downward, jaw unclenched, breath steady. This alignment allows hours of repetition later without fatigue. At any moment, if your lower back begins to arch or wrists ache, reset the baseline entirely. The Egyptian Orbiting Circles depends on longevity of motion—posture failure shortens endurance more than muscle weakness does.
What she will feel in this phase is steadiness rather than movement. The constant shallow contact builds trust and allows her body to open naturally. Watch for slow breathing, pelvic tilts, or a softening belly as cues that she feels safe. The moment she starts to move with you unconsciously, you know alignment and pressure are balanced. If she stiffens or exhales sharply, ease pressure, reset, and resume slower.
Finish each practice by lowering the hips fully to the canvas and resting in a child’s-pose variation, letting the spine decompress. Journal the sensations as one sentence, for example: “Neutral plank, shallow 80%, Light pressure, steady breath through eight reps.” This captures your posture quality and internal rhythm without overcomplication. The more often you log the baseline, the more stable your future orbits will become.

========================================================================================
Module 2 teaches the keystrokes that build the Egyptian Orbiting Circles. You’re no longer just holding position; you’re shaping motion. Each keystroke is a miniature engine—one controlled Rocking or Angling move that later chains into the full circular orbit. You’ll be training them one by one from the forearm-plank baseline you established before. Stay in that neutral base, elbows under shoulders, spine long, hips aligned. For a mesomorph, your core power gives you clean torque, but you must keep it under control. For a below–five-inch length, your advantage is precision—small arcs that stay inside the shallow 80% depth zone, where sensation multiplies instead of dulling.
The first keystroke is the Forward Rock. From baseline, inhale to load the hips slightly back, exhale as you glide forward by tightening your lower abs and pushing from the forearms. This is a Rocking action along the north compass line—straight ahead. The motion is short, no deeper than a finger-width shift. Keep pressure light to medium, never hard, because your build doesn’t rely on deep impact. This keystroke teaches how to carry momentum from the core rather than the knees or back. You’ll feel a smooth compression through the front wall; the sensation should build warmth, not friction. After five or six cycles, pause, inhale, and reset to neutral.
The second keystroke is the Diagonal Sweep. Starting from baseline, inhale as you pivot your left hip slightly toward the floor, then exhale while gliding the pelvis diagonally toward the upper right—this forms a northeast path. That’s your Angling movement. It traces a corner of the eventual circle. Keep the range tight and use your forearms to stabilize so the chest doesn’t twist. Pressure stays light and travels across the shallow wall like drawing a crescent. Alternate diagonals—right-to-left, left-to-right—to balance the pattern. These lateral shifts activate the obliques and deepen proprioception, so your body learns the perimeter of each orbit. For your build, keep weight balanced evenly between both forearms to avoid shoulder fatigue.
The third keystroke is the Reverse Pullback. From baseline, inhale and pull your navel slightly toward your spine as your hips retract along the southwest compass line—Angling backward. Exhale through the return to neutral. The sensation should feel like drawing energy back rather than withdrawing mechanically. This trains the backside of the orbit and prepares the body for looping continuity. Because your depth limit is smaller, focus on the suction effect at the exit phase. Done right, it strengthens the pelvic floor and builds sensitivity to partner cues like deepening breath or subtle pelvic follow-through.
Each of these keystrokes—Forward Rock, Diagonal Sweep, Reverse Pullback—forms a spoke in the circular motion. Practicing them separately lets your nervous system memorize control points before connecting them. Keep your breath slow and audible, pressure in light to medium bands, always returning to the neutral plank every few cycles. Journal one line after training: “FR–DS–RP clean @ 12 cycles, pressure smooth, no strain.” This confirms each movement is distinct yet fluid enough to chain later.

========================================================================================
Module 3 is where the separate keystrokes begin to fuse into one continuous rhythm. You’ll now build the full Egyptian Orbiting Circles from the Forward Rock, Diagonal Sweep, and Reverse Pullback. The idea is not to move harder, but to move rounder. The circle isn’t drawn with size—it’s drawn with precision. Stay in your forearm-plank baseline, elbows under shoulders, spine aligned. Inhale through the setup, feel the abdomen expand, and exhale into control. For a mesomorph, resist the temptation to muscle the movement. For a below–five-inch length, keep all action inside the shallow 80%, letting rhythm—not reach—create intensity.
Start the chain by linking the Forward Rock to the Diagonal Sweep. Inhale, shift slightly back, and on your exhale glide forward into the north line. At the end of the exhale, pivot the pelvis diagonally toward the right in one smooth continuation, tracing a quarter arc. Inhale as you retract through the Reverse Pullback to the southwest, and exhale returning to the starting position. That sequence—forward, diagonal, reverse—is one orbit. The movement should feel like water spiraling in a bowl, always recycling energy rather than pushing outward. Pressure stays light-to-medium, breath is continuous, and every two or three cycles, you pause and reset in the baseline to avoid overactivation of your lower back.
Pay attention to how the motion feels internally. When it’s done right, you’ll sense a gentle torsion through the abdominal wall and a smooth coiling of the obliques. The pelvis should never jerk or slide abruptly. For your frame, focus on stabilizing with the thighs and keeping your upper body still, using the forearms as grounding anchors. This keeps torque clean and transfers pressure exactly where it’s needed—into the shallow walls. Each orbit should feel circular in the lower abdomen, not linear through the spine. Think of tracing a coin-sized circle, not a wheel-sized one.
Your breath controls speed and force. Inhale to expand the belly and slightly lift the hips at the back of the circle. Exhale to drive forward and down through the front arc. The rhythm should be steady, almost hypnotic, with each breath cycle completing one full circle. If you feel shoulder or lumbar fatigue, reduce the amplitude by half and slow your tempo until the motion feels effortless again. Below five inches, this economy of movement amplifies stimulation instead of reducing it—it focuses sensation on the sensitive shallow band, keeping rhythm crisp and consistent.
After about twenty cycles, pause completely. Inhale deeply through the nose, hold for a moment, and let the hips sink into full rest. Notice the internal pulse that remains after movement stops—that lingering vibration is the first trace of automatic Flow. Journal one line after practice: “Full orbit @ 20 cycles, rhythm smooth, breath synced.” This confirms that the stroke’s shape is now internalized and ready for sensory refinement under SSP.

========================================================================================
Module 4 begins the Tracking phase—the first step in refining control under the SSP system. Here, you’re not performing for intensity. You’re observing, testing, and tuning. The Egyptian Orbiting Circles are now functional; the goal is to make them intelligent. Stay in the forearm-plank baseline and restrict your range to the shallow 80%. That’s where sensory data is richest. For a mesomorph, your strength can mask subtleties, so reduce muscular tension by half. For a below–five-inch length, you’re already optimized for this zone—your focus should be precision in pressure, not expansion in range.
Start by defining your hypothesis. In this case: “A slower orbit with even pressure creates steadier stimulation and less drift.” You’ll test that in short mini-sets. From baseline, inhale, then exhale as you begin the orbit—forward, diagonal, reverse. Keep the tempo slow enough that one full breath equals one full circle. Count five cycles, pause, and reset. During each orbit, feel how pressure distributes across the shallow walls. The front wall will register warmth first; the diagonals will feel slicker and less resistant. Note whether pressure spikes or drops at any quadrant of the circle. That’s your feedback loop.
When you sense a rough spot—say, the motion snags as you transition from diagonal to reverse—don’t push through it. Return to neutral. Inhale, soften your abs, then restart the motion slightly smaller. This tests whether the friction came from overextension or misalignment. That’s the “Refine” step of the SSP loop. Each iteration teaches your nervous system how to self-correct. The compass reference stays front-to-diagonal-to-reverse, shallow wall only, pressure in the light-to-medium band. Breath is continuous, no breath holds. If your shoulders or lumbar region tighten, stop immediately, stretch the core, and reset.
As you continue, add sensory tracking. The aim is to notice not only what you feel, but also what she would later feel from this motion. Her cues, when this technique is applied with a partner, are subtle: her breath deepens, hips hover still, then curl slightly toward you. These are confirmations that rhythm is correct and pressure is balanced. For now, visualize these cues lightly, using them as checkpoints rather than fantasies. Keep the breath steady and audible, letting each exhale flatten the abdomen slightly so the core stays engaged.
After fifteen to twenty minutes of cycling through hypothesis, test, observation, and refinement, pause and let your body cool in neutral. The pelvis will feel heavier, the core warm, and the breath quiet. That’s how you know the nervous system has learned, not just the muscles. Write a one-line journal tag: “SSP loop clean @ 20min—front wall consistent, diagonal smooth.” This is your first complete Tracking Phase record, and it builds the foundation for entering Flow.

========================================================================================
Module 5 opens the Flow phase—the first moment where practice starts to feel automatic. The goal now is to sustain the Egyptian Orbiting Circles without losing awareness. Flow happens when muscle memory, breath rhythm, and wall feedback merge into one continuous feedback loop. Begin in your forearm-plank baseline. Inhale to prepare, exhale into motion. Stay within the shallow 80% for the first few minutes; that’s where Flow is born. For a mesomorph, soften power until movement feels like gliding through water instead of driving through air. For a below–five-inch length, keep arcs small and clean—your control of micro-pressure is what creates pleasure later, not depth.
Start your orbit slowly—Forward Rock, Diagonal Sweep, Reverse Pullback—but this time, do not break between them. Let one breath pull the circle forward, and another draw it back. The inhale lifts the pelvis slightly; the exhale presses forward and around. You’re no longer thinking about keystrokes. You’re breathing in shapes. Maintain light-to-medium pressure throughout, and focus on the sensation of rolling across the shallow wall, as though painting it evenly with each pass. The rhythm should feel tidal, not repetitive—a natural rise and fall that never stalls or spikes. Every few minutes, return briefly to neutral baseline, inhale deeply, then re-enter the flow. This reset keeps clarity in the lower back and prevents fatigue.
As your tempo stabilizes, begin testing mid-zone inclusion—only if the orbit feels frictionless and your body stays loose. Mid zone here means just touching the entrance of the deep 10%, not pushing into it. For your frame and size, this zone should feel like an echo rather than a thrust. Use one or two cycles per minute to graze that layer, then immediately return to the shallow range. This grazing keeps the nervous system alert without overloading pressure. If you feel resistance or the breath tightens, drop back to shallow work. Flow must feel circular, not linear or forced.
You’ll know the Flow is correct when your breath and movement sync automatically. Inhale—hips rise, exhale—hips circle down and forward. The shoulders stay steady, forearms grounding into the floor. The abdomen stays active but never rigid. For mesomorphs, this control turns strength into precision. The internal effect is a spreading heat around the pelvic bowl, almost like current. Let that warmth circulate without forcing it anywhere. Flow refines awareness until each orbit feels inevitable, as if it’s drawing itself.
When you finish, stop mid-exhale. Let the hips settle, spine long, and breathe three times through the nose. The body should feel calm but charged, not exhausted. Journal one line: “Flow steady @ shallow 80%, mid graze smooth, rhythm self-sustaining.” This confirms that you’ve achieved Flow-state consistency and are ready for deeper pressure control.

========================================================================================
Module 6 explores the Deep Flow option, the expansion of control into the mid and deep 10%. This is where subtlety matters most—power alone will fail here. The Egyptian Orbiting Circles become smaller and slower in appearance but fuller in internal feel. Begin in your stable forearm-plank baseline, breath deep through the nose, exhale through the mouth, and confirm that your shoulders, spine, and hips are aligned. For a mesomorph, this alignment is your protection; your natural strength must distribute evenly so no joint absorbs excess torque. For a below–five-inch length, deep work is not about penetration—it’s about precision of angle and timing. Think of deep zones as the resonance chamber, not the target.
Start with three orbits at shallow 80% to warm the walls. On the fourth inhale, lift the hips slightly and angle the pelvis downward so the shaft points north at a low diagonal. As you exhale, press forward with medium pressure, tracing the same circular path but compressing it—smaller radius, slower motion. The moment you feel the subtle increase in internal resistance, that’s the edge of the mid 10%. Hold that level; do not push deeper. This is where the deep Flow lives. Maintain breath pacing: inhale as hips lift back, exhale as you spiral forward. Keep the abdomen soft so pressure transmits evenly. The goal is not to hit the deep wall but to roll near it, coaxing sensation instead of imposing it.
At this depth, each orbit should take one full breath cycle. The motion feels more like a pulse than a rotation. The Rocking quality now dominates—forward and backward pressure waves—while Angling remains minimal, just enough to maintain the circular trace. You’ll feel more contact through the north wall and the upper diagonals, less along the base. The internal effect for her, when applied later, is a low, spreading vibration rather than a sharp impact. To stay safe, apply the 80–10–10 rule strictly: 80% of your training time remains shallow, 10% mid, 10% deep. If breath catches or lower back tightens, stop, reset in shallow orbit, and re-enter only when your body feels fluid again.
Mesomorph leverage can tempt you to overdrive these cycles. Counter it by reducing core contraction and letting gravity assist the descent. Think of this motion like orbiting under water—slow, circular, pressure balanced. Each exhale should lengthen slightly, making the pelvis drop an extra centimeter, then release fully at the bottom of the circle. Below five inches, this motion magnifies stimulation along the north wall’s sensitive ridge. The key is tempo control, not amplitude. Train to sustain deep pressure for five cycles, then return to shallow Flow for recovery. This alternation builds endurance in the pelvic stabilizers while teaching the body to shift depth seamlessly.
When the practice feels stable, pause in neutral, draw three slow breaths, and feel the core’s residual warmth. The body should feel grounded, the lower abdomen heavy, breath deep but easy. Journal one simple tag: “Deep 10% held @ 5 cycles, pressure steady, smooth re-entry to 80%.” That note tells you your deep integration is ready for precision testing in Pinning.

========================================================================================
Module 7 refines the Egyptian Orbiting Circles into Pinning—the art of holding her arousal steady and redirecting it with precision. You’re not circling anymore for movement’s sake. You’re shaping pressure the way a musician holds a sustained note. Begin in your forearm-plank baseline, breathe in deeply, exhale to settle your weight evenly through shoulders, abdomen, and hips. The circle now becomes tighter—no more than a coin’s width at its widest point. Each micro-rotation presses and releases against the same shallow north-diagonal zone, reintroducing controlled torque and release. For a mesomorph, restrain power and rely on the steadiness of your breath; your size gives you stability, not license to press harder. For a below–five-inch length, the advantage is contact precision. Every shift you make lands on target.
Start the Pinning loop by choosing one quadrant of the orbit—preferably the north-to-northeast diagonal. Inhale, lift hips slightly, and as you exhale, press into that section and hold pressure there for one full second. Feel the internal counterpressure through your core; that resistance means alignment is correct. On the next inhale, retreat a fraction of an inch, maintaining connection, and exhale again to reapply pressure. Repeat this slow pulse for three to five breaths, then roll the orbit just a few degrees clockwise, tracing the next segment. Over time, you’re rotating a circle in slow motion—one quadrant at a time—never losing contact, never breaking breath rhythm.
The key sensation is stability. Your breath, not your arms, moves the orbit. Inhale to draw back; exhale to drive forward. Each exhale deepens pressure slightly, each inhale softens it. The rhythm phase here is pure Pinning—stillness within movement. You’ll feel the abdominal wall heat, the thighs steady, and the spine lengthen. Internally, if she were present, this would translate to her hips freezing and her breath catching as if pinned by the rhythm. For your solo training, track the same cue inside your own body: when motion feels anchored and quiet, you’ve entered correct resonance.
SSP logic applies: observe, tweak, test. If tension builds in your shoulders or lower back, you’re overdriving. Drop back into shallow 80% and reapproach with lighter pressure. If rhythm fades, reset breath—inhale through the nose, exhale with a quiet sigh through the mouth. The goal isn’t to sustain endlessly but to return easily. Each Pinning cycle should last no more than a minute before resetting to shallow Flow. This repetition builds the endurance to hold arousal without exhaustion.
As you close, release all pressure and rest hips to the mat. The abdomen should feel warm and stable, the breath low and smooth. Journal one reflection in prose: “North diagonal pinned @ 5 breaths, stable torque, pressure even.” That single line confirms mastery of control and readiness for integration.

========================================================================================
Module 8 completes the Egyptian Orbiting Circles training by fusing every prior layer into a full four-week integration plan. This is where repetition matures into instinct and where the stroke becomes a living skill rather than an exercise. Begin in the forearm-plank posture you’ve drilled since Module 1—shoulders aligned over elbows, spine long, hips steady. Take one slow inhale through the nose, one patient exhale through the mouth, and feel the weight settle through your centerline. Each session starts here, because posture is the anchor that keeps pressure, angle, and depth consistent under fatigue. For a mesomorph, this baseline protects against overrecruiting large muscles; strength must channel into smooth, rhythmic control. For a below–five-inch length, this setup ensures every centimeter of movement counts, translating mechanical precision into sensitivity.
The first week’s focus is rebuilding endurance within the shallow 80%. Train the Forward Rock, Diagonal Sweep, and Reverse Pullback individually, five minutes each, separated by short resets. Each breath cycle defines one repetition—inhale to prepare, exhale through action. Keep pressure light and tempo slow enough that movement feels like drawing circles on warm glass. By the second week, begin chaining them continuously, using one or two cycles per minute to test transitions. The emphasis remains breath control: every motion must begin and end with exhale. Journal each session with a one-line tag such as “Orbit smooth @ 80%, breath aligned, hips stable.” These simple records become your SSP data—evidence of how the body adapts across days.
In the third week, bring in mid-depth control from Module 6. Work at 80–10–10 pacing: eight cycles shallow, one mid, one recovery. Treat the mid contact like a test pulse—firm but brief—then immediately retreat. For your build and length, this pattern teaches how to maximize sensation without chasing depth. Pay attention to when breath deepens naturally; that’s the moment to log as optimal pressure. Avoid training fatigue by ending each set with three slow baseline breaths. Reflection after each session should read in prose, “Mid touch responsive, core warm, return to 80% easy.”
In the fourth week, introduce Pinning from Module 7. Choose one quadrant—north or northeast diagonal—and spend short intervals holding pressure there for three to five breaths, then flowing out. Alternate with shallow Flow to prevent muscular lockout. For mesomorph stability, limit total deep or pinning time to no more than ten minutes per session. Between sets, stretch wrists and spine, keeping posture neutral. If fatigue builds, roll the shoulders and reset. The point of integration is not endurance; it’s consistency—being able to drop into orbit, depth, or pinning with the same accuracy at any moment.
Over the month, you will feel the body memorize arcs, angles, and depth transitions. Flow will appear faster, pressure will self-correct, and breath will guide movement automatically. Each practice ends with three neutral breaths and a mental scan of wrists, core, and hips. The body should feel long, calm, and slightly heated—a sign of well-balanced load. The Egyptian Orbiting Circles are now fully trained into your system. Your final journal note can be a single sentence in prose: “Full orbit cycle complete @ 80–10–10, breath continuous, motion effortless.” The mastery of control, not power, defines your level now. You have built stability, precision, and flow—the three pillars of deep sensual competence.
