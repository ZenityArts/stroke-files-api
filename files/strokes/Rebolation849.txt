Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the first step of your transformational journey with the Rebloation Stroke—a sophisticated technique designed to channel the raw, cumulative power of your robust endomorphic build and extended asset (above 7 inches) into an intimate performance of precise, cumulative stimulation. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to be your guide. In this program, we’re focusing specifically on endomorphs like yourself. Your body is a powerhouse—solid, full‑figured, and naturally built for endurance and strength. With an extension above 7 inches, you have remarkable reach that can deliver deep, intense stimulation when you learn to control your powerful energy with precision.
Imagine stepping into your personal training space—a quiet, dedicated arena where every distraction disappears and your sole focus is refining your technique. Feel the firm, supportive floor under your feet; it reflects the unwavering stability of your endomorphic frame. Take several deep, intentional breaths—inhale deeply, drawing in a surge of concentrated energy, and exhale slowly, releasing all tension. This is your space, brother—a sanctuary where your raw potential is molded into a beautifully choreographed Rebloation Stroke that builds cumulative stimulation with every calculated movement.
We begin by modifying the classic missionary position to optimally suit your powerful build. Start in a modified plank position, with your knees planted securely on a stable surface engineered to support your substantial mass. This anchoring stance is crucial—it locks your body into a position where every micro‑movement, from the careful twisting of your hips to the final lateral shift, is executed with deliberate control. Your natural strength and endurance mean you generate significant force, but with an extended asset above 7 inches, precision becomes your key focus: you must direct that force exactly where it will bring maximum pleasure without overwhelming your partner’s delicate, sensitive areas.
Once your body is firmly anchored, you carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Consider this deliberate insertion as the blueprint for your stroke—it sets the exact alignment, the precise pressure points, and the proper angle from which every subsequent movement will be executed. Your Rebloation Stroke journey unfolds in a structured sequence: you initiate with a smooth, deliberate forward push, followed by four individual hip rotations to the right, then four individual hip rotations to the left, and finally, you conclude the cycle with a lateral shift to the left. Each of these individual hip rotations is a keystroke in your stroke—when executed correctly, the hilt of your penis applies consistent pressure as it canvasses specific segments of your partner’s vaginal opening while the head adapts its angle to build cumulative stimulation layer by layer.
Because you are an endomorph with an extension above 7 inches, you have an immense capacity to generate power, but the key is to harness that power with precision. You must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle: approximately 80% of your force should target the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining 20% is evenly distributed between the mid‑depth (3 to 5 inches) and deep (beyond 5 inches) regions. This thoughtful force allocation ensures that the cumulative stimulation builds steadily and effectively, without either overwhelming or under-stimulating any part of your partner’s canal.
This introductory module sets the stage, brother. Here, you learn how to establish your training environment, adopt the optimal posture, and channel your robust, endomorphic power along with your extended asset into a Rebloation Stroke that transforms raw strength into a precisely controlled performance. Today marks the beginning of turning your natural power into an intimate masterpiece—a performance that’s as much about precision as it is about cumulative pleasure. Welcome, brother, your journey to mastery starts now.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, and Flow
Alright, brother, now let’s break down the core principles that provide the intellectual and physical framework for your Rebloation Stroke. It’s crucial that you fully grasp these elements so you can train effectively and achieve cumulative, balanced stimulation with every stroke you deliver.
First, consider the 80‑10‑10 principle as your force‑distribution blueprint. Here’s the idea in simple terms: about 80% of the stimulation you apply should be concentrated on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because this zone holds the highest density of nerve endings, making it the most sensitive and responsive area. The remaining 20% of your force is not wasted—it’s evenly divided so that 10% goes to the mid‑depth zone (roughly 3 to 5 inches), and the other 10% is aimed at the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an endomorph with an extended asset above 7 inches, this means that while you have the power to reach deep, the majority of your applied force must be targeted to that ultra‑sensitive shallow area. This method of force distribution ensures that your stimulation builds cumulatively, layer by layer, without overloading any single area.
Next, let’s explore the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic, step‑by‑step approach that refines your technique over time. This process begins with defining your goal. For the Rebloation Stroke, you might establish an objective like “maximizing cumulative stimulation with each precise hip rotation.” Once your goal is in place, you form a hypothesis—maybe you suspect that a slightly slower, more controlled rotation will enhance the cumulative effect, or that a particular angle will direct more focused pressure where it’s needed. After your hypothesis, the process moves into tracking. During tracking, you perform about 30 repetitions for each movement segment while paying close attention to both your physical responses (engaging your core, activating your pelvic floor) and, importantly, to your partner’s feedback. Listen for her deep, rhythmic breathing, observe subtle shifts in her posture, and capture any soft verbal cues. This immediate, real‑time feedback is invaluable—it tells you which aspects of your stroke are hitting the right spots and which need refining.
Once you’ve gathered sufficient data through tracking, you naturally progress into a state known as flow. Flow is that almost magical condition where every micro‑movement—from your controlled forward push to each precise hip rotation—occurs automatically and seamlessly, like a perfectly choreographed dance. In flow, you no longer have to consciously manage each element; your body performs each move with the exact timing and pressure that tracking has honed, allowing cumulative stimulation to build effortlessly with each repetition.
While some strokes rely on separate drills like the tap keystroke to hone lateral movement, with the Rebloation Stroke, your keystrokes are inherent in the precise hip rotations themselves. Training involves isolating and repeating each hip rotation and the final lateral shift until they become second nature. Through dedicated, rigorous practice, you embed a high level of precision into your muscle memory, ensuring that every rotation consistently contributes to cumulative, balanced stimulation.
To sum it up, brother: • The 80‑10‑10 principle dictates that 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep layers. • The Sexual Scientific Process—through clear goal setting, hypothesis formation, meticulous tracking, and achieving flow—provides you with a scientific method to continuously refine your technique. • By isolating and drilling the specific keystrokes (the individual hip rotations and the lateral shift), you develop the precision necessary to deliver consistent, cumulative stimulation.
Together, these elements form the foundation on which you build your mastery of the Rebloation Stroke, ensuring that every move you make is both scientifically sound and artistically executed.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Rebloation Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Rebloation Stroke step by step so that you have a clear, detailed blueprint for transforming your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension into a performance of cumulative, targeted stimulation. The Rebloation Stroke is performed in the classic missionary position—you’re on top, in a modified plank with your knees firmly on the canvas, and your penis is inserted at a controlled, downward diagonal angle. Once inserted, the stroke unfolds in a structured, sequential pattern: you first perform four individual hip rotations to the right, then four individual hip rotations to the left, and finally, you complete the cycle with one precise lateral shift to the left.
We begin with the forward push—the foundation of the stroke. From your stable position, drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head with a smooth, deliberate push. As you move forward, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, purposeful contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is below 5 inches, the 80‑10‑10 principle instructs you to focus about 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining force is evenly distributed between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This forward push lays the cumulative foundation upon which the hip rotations will build additional stimulation.
Next, we move to the first phase of the rotational sequence: four individual hip rotations to the right. As you initiate each rotation to the right, concentrate on the hilt of your penis as it applies steady pressure—“canvassing” the vaginal opening by moving from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment. At the same time, observe how the head of your penis adjusts its angle—it initially directs its pressure toward the southwestern wall before gradually shifting to the north‑western wall with each rotation. Each individual rotation is a keystroke that adds another layer of stimulation, cumulatively intensifying the overall effect.
After finishing the four right rotations, you transition into the second phase: four individual hip rotations to the left. This phase mirrors the first: as you rotate to the left, the hilt now canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head begins by pointing toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall with each rotation. This balanced, alternating rotational pattern creates a rhythmic, cumulative effect that ensures every part of her vaginal canal is stimulated evenly.
Finally, to complete the stroke, you execute one lateral shift to the left. This final shift is essential—it rounds out the sequence and ensures that any areas not fully engaged by the rotations receive additional cumulative stimulation. Throughout each phase, every movement is calibrated to adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, so that approximately 80% of your force continuously targets the shallow, sensitive zone while the remaining force is judiciously balanced.
This deconstruction provides you with a clear, step-by-step roadmap for the Rebloation Stroke. It breaks down your raw ectomorphic agility and compact extension into a series of meticulously coordinated movements, each designed to build cumulative, targeted stimulation through precise hip rotations and a concluding lateral shift.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each individual component of the Rebloation Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with impeccable precision. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, you are built for rapid, precise movements—but each hip rotation must be controlled with laser accuracy. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and drill it repeatedly until it becomes second nature, always keeping in mind the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Start with the forward push drill. In your modified missionary position, with your knees firmly planted on a supportive, stable surface, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Then, slowly execute a forward push toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation as the top shelf of your compact extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is compact, allocate approximately 80% of your force to the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. Repeat this forward push slowly and methodically until the movement is perfectly smooth and completely automatic.
Next, isolate the hip rotation drills. Begin with a single rotation to the right. From your established position, initiate one deliberate hip rotation to the right and concentrate on the hilt of your penis as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, note how the head initially directs pressure toward the southwestern wall before shifting to the north‑western wall. Execute one complete rotation slowly, then pause, reset, and repeat for at least 30 repetitions until the movement is ingrained in your muscle memory. Then, switch to drilling a single rotation to the left. As you rotate to the left, feel the hilt canvas smoothly from the north‑western to the south‑western segment while the head transitions from pointing initially to the southeastern wall to shifting toward the north‑eastern wall. Alternate these rotations until you can move seamlessly between right and left, with every move strictly following the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
After you’ve perfected the individual hip rotations, practice the final lateral shift drill. Slowly shift your entire body laterally to the left, ensuring that your movement is controlled and that your force distribution remains consistent with the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this lateral shift repeatedly until it becomes as natural and fluid as the individual rotations.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing—each deep inhale fuels your next precise move, and every measured exhale ensures a smooth transition between drills. By rigorously repeating these keystrokes—the forward push, the right and left hip rotations, and the lateral shift—you build the muscle memory and precision required to deliver cumulative stimulation flawlessly with your Rebloation Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to synthesize all the drilled components into one seamless, continuous performance—the full Rebloation Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance, with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your entire focus on linking every micro‑movement into an uninterrupted, rhythmic sequence. In this integrated cycle, you combine your deliberate forward push with the sequence of four hip rotations to the right, followed by four hip rotations to the left, and then finish with one precise lateral shift to complete the stroke.
Begin with the forward push. From your stable, anchored position, insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push—executed in strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensures that about 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, super-sensitive zone, providing the cumulative foundation for the subsequent hip rotations.
Immediately following your forward push, enter the directional phase by performing four individual hip rotations to the right. With each right rotation, focus on the hilt steadily canvassing from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head alternates its pressure from pointing toward the southwestern wall to shifting toward the north‑western wall. Each rotation adds its increment to the cumulative stimulation.
Once you’ve completed the right rotations, transition seamlessly into four individual hip rotations to the left. As you rotate left, ensure that the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head shifts its focus from initially pointing toward the southeastern wall to ultimately moving toward the north‑eastern wall. This alternating pattern ensures a rhythmic, balanced delivery of cumulative stimulation across her entire vaginal canal.
Finally, finish the sequence with one deliberate lateral shift to the left. This final movement further amplifies the cumulative effect, ensuring that any areas not fully engaged by the rotations receive their share of stimulation. Throughout the integrated sequence, every movement follows the 80‑10‑10 principle—approximately 80% of your force is directed at the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone, while the remaining force is strategically distributed to ensure balance.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale provides the energy for the next precise move, and every measured exhale ensures a smooth transition between the forward push, the individual hip rotations, and the lateral shift. With each complete cycle, your Rebloation Stroke evolves into a continuous, fluid performance that leverages your natural ectomorphic agility and compact extension into a finely choreographed display of cumulative, targeted stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase—where every micro‑movement of your Rebloation Stroke is fine‑tuned until your performance becomes a seamlessly executed masterpiece of cumulative stimulation. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and a compact extension below 5 inches, every detail matters, particularly during each individual hip rotation. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains your guiding star: about 80% of your force must be concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining force is evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you execute your integrated sequence, pay close attention to every nuance. During your forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your compact extension glides effortlessly over her clitoral region, and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When performing your four right and four left hip rotations, observe carefully how the hilt canvasses each segment of her vaginal opening, and note how the head shifts its pressure—first directing it toward one wall, then transitioning to the opposite wall. This is where tracking becomes indispensable. Every repetition provides immediate, real‑time feedback. Listen to her deep, rhythmic breathing, watch for subtle shifts in her posture, and be highly attuned to soft verbal cues that indicate which elements of your stroke yield the best cumulative stimulation. This tracking is your critical feedback loop, enabling you to adjust your speed, angle, or force with pinpoint precision.
Once you’ve gathered enough tracking data—ideally around 30 repetitions for each directional phase—you naturally slip into a state of flow. Flow is that near‑magical state where every micro‑movement—from the deliberate forward push to each meticulously executed hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically in perfect rhythm. In flow, your body delivers the exact pressure and timing that tracking has helped you optimize, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with every repetition. Deep, controlled breathing is essential during this phase; every deep inhale primes you for the next move, and every measured exhale smooths the transitions. And if any movement seems off, pause, re‑track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is flawless.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to create your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training program tailored to reinforce every element of your Rebloation Stroke while building the core strength and overall stability essential for your lean, agile ectomorphic build and compact extension. Your natural speed and precision are your greatest assets, and this routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that delivers cumulative, targeted stimulation every time.
Begin by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are eliminated and your entire focus is on perfecting your technique. Every training session should start with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your ectomorphic structure. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these essential muscle groups form the foundation of your stability, ensuring that each micro‑movement is executed with absolute precision. Visualize every stretch as igniting your internal engine, priming every muscle and joint for the intensive drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a positive, determined tone for your session.
Next, proceed to your specialized drills, starting with the forward push. In your modified missionary position, insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle, and practice a smooth, deliberate forward push toward your partner’s head. Since your extension is compact, concentrate about 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone. Once you master this forward push, isolate the individual hip rotations. Begin with the right rotations—practice each rotation slowly and deliberately until the hilt consistently canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, while the head shifts reliably from the southwestern to the north‑western wall. Repeat this for at least 30 repetitions until it becomes ingrained in your muscle memory. Then, mirror the process with left hip rotations until you can execute them seamlessly. Finally, practice the concluding lateral shift that completes the cycle. Alternate these drills until every keystroke of your Rebloation Stroke is second nature.
Throughout your session, maintain deep, controlled breathing to support smooth and precise movements. Supplement your specialized drills with core‑strengthening exercises—such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills—because a strong core is the anchor that ensures every rapid movement is executed with maximum precision. Lastly, keep a detailed training journal where you record each session, note the number of repetitions, document adjustments you experiment with, and capture her feedback. This journal is an essential tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to track your progress and refine your technique continuously until it’s perfected.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—the pinnacle of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Rebloation Stroke converges into one continuous, seamless performance. In this final module, your lean, agile ectomorphic build and compact extension come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of mastery that is both scientifically refined and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position in your modified missionary stance—with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core fully engaged, and your mind dialed in for absolute precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide effortlessly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that around 80% of your force is directed to the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone while the remaining 20% is meticulously balanced to stimulate the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately after the forward push, transition into the hip rotation phase by executing four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation, focus on the hilt applying steady, targeted pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head first directs pressure toward the southwestern wall before shifting to the north‑western wall. Once you’ve completed the right rotations, seamlessly transition into four individual rotations to the left, where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and the head shifts from initially pointing toward the southeastern wall to ultimately moving toward the north‑eastern wall. Finally, conclude the sequence with one deliberate lateral shift to the left. This final movement further consolidates the cumulative effect, ensuring that every area of her vaginal canal is engaged.
Throughout the integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale fuels your next precise movement, and every controlled exhale creates smooth transitions between the forward push, hip rotations, and lateral shift. If any component feels off—if a rotation lacks perfect precision or the pressure distribution is unbalanced—pause, re‑track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is flawless.
The ultimate goal is to reach a state of natural flow—a condition where every forward push, every hip rotation, and every lateral shift happens automatically with impeccable precision and cumulative intensity. When this state is achieved, your Rebloation Stroke will have evolved into a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers targeted, cumulative stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every individual hip rotation, and every lateral shift is executed with flawless cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your lean, agile ectomorphic build and your compact extension will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Rebloation Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure every time. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Rebloation Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
