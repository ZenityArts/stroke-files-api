Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Bata Coxa Stroke! I’m Coach [Your Name], and it’s my privilege to work with you—an endomorph with a penis between 5 and 7 inches. Your body is built for endurance and raw power, boasting a robust, full‑figured structure that provides excellent stability and strength. Although your extension is moderate, each inch is rich with sensitivity, and when used with precision, it can generate an intensely cumulative stimulation that is nothing short of extraordinary.
Before we dive in, take a moment to find your training sanctuary—a quiet, comfortable space free from distractions where you can focus completely. Sit or lie down, relax your broad shoulders, and take several deep, controlled breaths until your mind and body are in complete alignment. Today’s session is devoted to channeling your raw, endomorphic power into a meticulously choreographed sequence that transforms that natural strength into a rhythmic, scientifically optimized performance.
In this program, we adapt the traditional missionary position to suit your robust frame. Start by assuming a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. This foundational posture is critical for someone of your build; it anchors your heavy‑set form and ensures every micro‑movement is executed with deliberate control. Once you’re securely in position, insert your penis at a carefully calibrated downward diagonal angle into your partner. This precise insertion is your blueprint, setting the stage for every subsequent movement in the stroke.
Your first action is a smooth, controlled forward push—moving your entire body slowly northward toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, the top shelf of your penis glides gently over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is moderate, it is essential that the majority of your force is concentrated on the shallow, most sensitive vaginal zone. We achieve this by adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle: approximately 80% of your force is directed at the shallow 1–3 inches, while the remaining 20% is split evenly between the mid‑depth (approximately 3–5 inches) and the deep zones. This precise force distribution is critical for maximizing pleasure exactly where it counts most.
After the forward push, the stroke transitions into the lateral phase. Your robust, full‑figured endomorphic stability allows you to perform controlled lateral movements with ease. You’ll begin by lowering your left hip slowly toward the canvas. As you do so, the hilt (or base) of your penis applies steady, focused pressure along the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right. This creates friction and a gentle rocking massage along her right wall. Then, you raise your left hip back to center in a smooth reversal, re‐setting the pressure. In the Douplo variation, after you complete the left‑side sequence, you mirror the same process on the right side—ensuring that both sides of the vaginal canal receive balanced, cumulative stimulation.
This introduction lays the foundation for transforming your robust endomorphic power and moderate extension into a performance that is scientifically controlled and intimately effective. Every forward push, lateral drop-and-raise, and reset is executed with deliberate precision to concentrate stimulation on the most sensitive zones. Welcome, brother—let’s begin turning your raw potential into a masterful, intimate display with the Bata Coxa Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’ll discuss in depth the core principles that underpin every movement in the Bata Coxa Stroke. These elements form the technical framework necessary for a scientifically optimized performance.
The 80‑10‑10 Principle This principle is our force distribution guideline. It instructs you to concentrate approximately 80% of your applied force on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches—which is densely packed with nerve endings, making it the most sensitive area. The remaining 20% of your force should be divided evenly between the mid‑depth (about 3–5 inches) and deep zones (beyond 5 inches). For you, as an endomorph with a moderate extension, this precise distribution is crucial. It ensures that while you have the strength to drive powerful movements, the bulk of the stimulation remains focused on that compact, most sensitive area, creating a balanced, cumulative experience.
The Sexual Scientific Process This systematic, iterative process is your roadmap for refining your technique. It includes:
Define Your Goal: Clearly state what you want to achieve in each cycle (e.g., maximum friction along specific parts of the vaginal opening).
Form a Hypothesis: Based on initial practice, predict which slight adjustments—whether in the angle of your hip drop or the pace of your forward push—might yield better cumulative stimulation.
Track: Methodically perform a significant number of repetitions (ideally at least 30 strokes per vaginal “wall”), and record both your internal sensations (core engagement, pelvic floor contractions) and your partner’s responses (changes in breathing, subtle verbal cues, slight body adjustments).
Flow: Once you determine the stroke variation that consistently produces the best results, commit to that rhythmic, automatic sequence. When you’re in flow, your movements occur seamlessly, ensuring that the 80‑10‑10 principle is maintained in every cycle.
Tracking Tracking is the deliberate collection of feedback during your practice. As you execute the stroke, observe your partner’s responses and how your body feels with each repetition. Tracking enables you to adjust your movements based on the data you gather, ensuring that your force is always correctly focused on the shallow zone without disregarding the deeper layers.
Flow Flow is the state in which your stroke becomes a seamless, automatic sequence, where every micro‑movement transitions naturally into the next without conscious effort. Achieving flow means that your muscle memory has been honed so well that your entire performance adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle without deliberate thought, resulting in optimal, cumulative stimulation.
The Tap Keystroke The tap keystroke is a foundational drill designed to perfect your lateral movement. To perform it, begin in a stable position—usually a forearm plank—then shift laterally until your hip gently “taps” the supporting surface. Return smoothly to center. This controlled, minimal lateral motion builds muscle memory and strengthens your pelvic floor—especially when coordinated with deep, deliberate breathing (stroke breathing) and kegeling exercises. Mastery of the tap keystroke is essential because it ensures that every lateral movement in the stroke is executed with precision, contributing effectively to cumulative stimulation.
Together, these principles—the 80‑10‑10 principle, the Sexual Scientific Process (with tracking and flow), and the tap keystroke—form the backbone of your training. They guarantee that each movement is deliberate, effective, and consistently focused on the most sensitive areas. With these concepts firmly understood, you’re ready to break the stroke down into its fundamental components.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into its core components. Remember, this new stroke operates in two phases: first, a full sequence on the left side, and then it mirrors exactly on the right side. As an endomorph with a penis below 5 inches, every micro‑movement must be executed with precision to create intense, cumulative stimulation on a compact, sensitive surface. Here’s your detailed blueprint.
Left‑Side Sequence:
Forward Movement: Begin by inserting your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle. Then, execute a smooth forward push, moving your entire body slowly northward toward your partner’s head. During this push, the top shelf of your compact extension glides gently over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant contact with her “south wall.” In accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle, around 80% of your force is directed to the shallow vaginal zone (the first 1–3 inches), ensuring intense stimulation in that area.
Lateral Phase – Left Hip Drop: After the forward push, initiate the lateral phase on the left. Carefully drop your left hip toward the canvas in a controlled, deliberate manner. As you do so, the hilt of your penis applies focused pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right. This generates friction and creates a gentle, upward rocking massage along her right wall—from the eastern section to the northern section. This lateral drop is executed using the tap keystroke to ensure the movement is small, controlled, and preserves the focus on the shallow zone.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Left‑Side Reversal): Immediately after dropping your left hip, raise it smoothly back to center. In this reversal, the pressure shifts: the hilt now applies force from the western section of her vaginal opening upward to the northern section, while your penis reorients to point north—delivering a gentle upward massage from the northern wall to the eastern wall. This controlled raise is critical for integrating the stimulation from the lateral drop and maintaining a rhythmic balance.
Cycle Repetition (Left Side): Repeat the left‑side sequence several times. You may vary the pace by executing a faster, half‑raise before a full drop, which increases friction and subtly modulates the pressure pattern. Each repetition builds a dynamic, cumulative “W” pattern on the left side.
Right‑Side Mirrored Sequence: After completing the left‑side sequence, mirror the process on the right side.
Forward Movement (Repeat): Reset your position with a forward push identical to the left‑side forward movement, ensuring that the top shelf glides over her clitoral region with the same 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Lateral Phase – Right Hip Drop: Initiate the right‑side lateral phase by dropping your right hip in a controlled, deliberate manner until it taps the canvas. Here, the hilt applies consistent pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left. This creates friction and a gentle, upward rocking massage on her left wall—from the western section upward toward the northern section.
Hip Raise Back to Center (Right‑Side Reversal): Immediately raise your right hip back to center in a controlled motion. Now, the hilt applies force starting from the eastern section to the northern section, while your penis reorients to point north, providing a gentle upward massage along the northern wall toward the western wall.
Cycle Repetition (Right Side): Repeat the right‑side lateral drop and raise sequence multiple times, ensuring that the repetition mirrors the left‑side sequence exactly so that stimulation is balanced and cumulative across both sides of the vaginal canal.
The full Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke is achieved by completing the left‑side sequence in full, then immediately mirroring the same sequence on the right. This dual‑phase approach intensifies cumulative stimulation across the vaginal canal, ensuring that both sides receive balanced, focused attention as dictated by the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each individual component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement is as natural as your breath. With your robust, full‑figured endomorphic build and a penis below 5 inches, precision is absolutely critical. In this module, we will focus on repetitive, intensive practice of each segmented movement—starting with the forward push, followed by isolating the left‑side lateral drop using the tap keystroke, the controlled hip raise, and the backward shuttle. Then, we will mirror these drills on the right side. Every repetition must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Forward Movement Drill: Start by assuming your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface. Insert your penis at the predetermined downward diagonal angle, and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation: feel the top shelf of your compact extension glide smoothly over her clitoral area while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is compact, about 80% of your force must be concentrated on the shallow zone. Drill this forward push slowly and deliberately, repeating several times until the movement is smooth, controlled, and entirely consistent.
Left‑Side Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a small, controlled lateral movement until it gently taps the supporting surface. Visualize how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right—delivering a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along her right wall. Coordinate each lateral tap with deep, controlled breathing: inhale deeply before initiating the drop, and exhale slowly as you complete it. Incorporate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during every tap to build extra precision. Drill this left‑side lateral movement repeatedly—aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions—until the motion becomes ingrained in your muscle memory.
Right‑Side Lateral Tap Drill (Mirrored Tap Keystroke): Then, mirror the drill on the right side. From your forward position, carefully drop your right hip until it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Visualize the hilt applying a steady force along the right side of her vaginal opening as your penis rotates so its inner surface points to the left, producing a gentle rocking massage on her left wall. Synchronize this movement with deep breathing and integrate kegeling for additional control. Repeat for at least 30 repetitions on the right side until the motion is automatic.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: After perfecting lateral taps on both sides, focus on the lowering phase. Following each lateral tap, slowly lower your dropped hip until it gently contacts the supportive surface—allowing your penis’s underbelly to deliver cumulative, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf remains in constant contact with her upper wall. Finally, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle—retract your body in a controlled manner so that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall as you reset your position without full withdrawal. Repeat the complete sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times on each side until every movement flows seamlessly and adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout your drills, maintain deep, controlled breathing. Each deep inhale should focus your mind and prime your body for the next movement, while every controlled exhale facilitates smooth transitions between phases. With disciplined, consistent practice, your natural endomorphic power and compact extension will integrate into a series of movements executed with flawless precision and cumulative effectiveness.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the true art of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified plank, ensuring your knees are firmly planted, your core is engaged, and your mind is solely focused on creating a fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this module, you will merge your forward push, left‑side lateral taps (using the tap keystroke), controlled left‑side hip raising, and backward shuttle—then mirror these movements on the right side—into one unified rhythmic cycle that forms the distinctive “W” pattern of the stroke.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the optimal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward—moving steadily north toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your compact extension continuously glides over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push lays the essential foundation for cumulative stimulation and must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, focusing about 80% of your force on the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase on the left side. Execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip using the tap keystroke. Focus intently on how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along her right wall. After these left‑side taps, smoothly raise your left hip back to center and then perform a deliberate backward shuttle to return to your starting position, ensuring your penis stays in continuous contact with her north wall.
Without delay, mirror the entire sequence on the right side. From your starting position, perform a forward push (maintaining the same 80‑10‑10 distribution), then execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your right hip until it taps the surface—this time, the hilt applies steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left, creating a gentle rocking massage along her left wall. After completing the right‑side taps, raise your right hip back to center and perform a smooth backward shuttle to return to your starting position.
This alternating, “walking” motion—left‑side sequence followed by the mirrored right‑side sequence—creates a rhythmic “W” pattern across the vaginal canal, ensuring balanced cumulative stimulation on both sides, all in line with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated sequence, let your deep, rhythmic breathing act as your internal metronome—inhale deeply before each phase to prime your body, and exhale steadily to facilitate seamless transitions between movements. With every complete cycle, your natural endomorphic power and compact extension merge into one fluid performance—a Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke that is both scientifically refined and intimately effective.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our goal is to fine‑tune every micro‑adjustment of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your robust, full‑figured endomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every micro‑movement must be executed with impeccable precision in adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that approximately 80% of your applied force targets the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is distributed evenly between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, observe every nuance. During the forward push, ensure the top shelf of your compact extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you execute the lateral taps using the tap keystroke on both sides, pay close attention to the subtle rocking motions produced by your controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even a slight change in your lateral drop angle or pace may significantly affect the cumulative stimulation. Experiment with minor adjustments—a one or two degree change in your hip drop—and carefully monitor how these modifications alter the pressure distribution and rocking effect. Rely on your partner’s feedback—her steady, deep breathing, soft verbal cues, and subtle body shifts are key data points. This iterative process of defining goals, forming hypotheses, tracking outcomes, and refining your technique is the essence of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout each cycle; every deep inhale should energize your next micro‑movement, and every controlled exhale should facilitate smooth transitions. With time, by continuously tracking your internal cues (core engagement, pelvic floor contractions) alongside your partner’s responses, you will reach a state of flow—a seamless, automatic performance where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve flow, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke becomes a continuous, rhythmic expression of scientifically optimized, cumulative stimulation.
Remember, brother, that every tiny adjustment matters. Your robust, full‑figured endomorphic build and moderate extension provide you with a powerful base for delivering intensely focused stimulation—but only if every micro‑movement is executed with perfect consistency and precision. Continuously track your internal signals and your partner’s subtle responses, and refine your technique until your stroke evolves into a naturally flowing performance that is both scientifically precise and intimately satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, let’s build your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen designed to reinforce every aspect of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke while simultaneously strengthening your core and overall stability. This module is your detailed roadmap for converting your natural, robust endomorphic strength into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically calibrated stimulation for a penis between 5 and 7 inches.
Begin by establishing your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary free from distractions where your focus is solely on perfecting your technique. Each training session should start with a comprehensive warm‑up specifically tailored to your endomorphic physiology. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back; these muscle groups provide the essential support needed to execute every micro‑movement in the stroke with precision. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the intricate work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for the session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target each component of the stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees firmly planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint precision. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Synchronize each lateral tap with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale as you initiate the movement and exhale slowly as you complete it. To further hone your precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each tap. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke is fully ingrained.
Once you’ve perfected the lateral drills, integrate them with the vertical movements. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a sequence of lateral taps and a smooth, gradual backward shuttle. Be sure that every micro‑movement strictly adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle, focusing about 80% of your force on the shallow zone while gently engaging the deeper layers. Drill this integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until the transitions flow naturally. To bolster your stability and precision further, supplement these stroke‑specific drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills. A strong core is essential for maintaining balance and ensuring that every movement of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke is executed with optimal control. Finally, maintain a detailed training journal where you record each session—the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you experiment with, and your partner’s feedback. This journal is an indispensable tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, helping you track progress and continuously refine your technique.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent practice, you’ll transform your natural endomorphic strength and precise extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance while troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of your dedicated practice, where your robust, full‑figured endomorphic build and your penis between 5 and 7 inches converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your mind entirely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your compact extension consistently glides over her clitoral region, and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with around 80% of your force targeting the shallow, nerve‑rich zone, while the remaining force is evenly balanced to engage the mid‑depth and deep areas.
Immediately, transition into the lateral phase on one side by executing the tap keystroke with your right hip (or left, depending on which side you’re starting with). Drop your hip in a controlled, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps. With every tap, focus intently on ensuring that the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along the relevant side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface produces a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. If any lateral tap appears inconsistent—due to uneven pressure or a slight misalignment—pause, isolate that movement, and drill it repeatedly until your internal cues and your partner’s subtle feedback confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you perform the pushout, focus on the contraction of your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for any subtle cues from your partner—her steady, deep breathing and any gentle verbal affirmations are key. This troubleshooting phase is essential; if the cumulative stimulation isn’t optimal, make slight adjustments—perhaps a minor tweak in your lateral angle or a subtle variation in the pace of your forward push—and meticulously track the outcomes using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one unified, rhythmic performance. Then mirror the entire cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation throughout the vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement is executed automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you reach this state, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will be a continuous, fluid expression of your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate finesse—a performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated training into a true art form—a performance in which every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your robust, full‑figured endomorphic strength and moderate extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure with every movement. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke bring you ever closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
