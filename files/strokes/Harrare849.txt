Module 1 for The Harrare is about learning how to build a strong and safe forearm-plank posture so the stroke can be performed with clarity, stamina, and control. Orientation is everything here, because without a stable base the keystrokes will lose their sharpness against her walls and your body will fatigue too quickly. Begin by setting your forearms flat on the canvas, elbows directly under your shoulders, and palms pressed in with fingers spread to distribute weight. Your spine should stay long, not sagging in the lower back, and your hips should line up with your shoulders rather than dropping or lifting too high. Knees are grounded for this stroke, which gives you a steady anchor while still allowing Rocking and Angling through the hips. Inhale at this neutral baseline, feel the ribs expand, then exhale to lock in your core so the movement begins from stability rather than strain.
As you move into the posture, be aware that an endomorph body type brings both the advantage of natural core mass and the risk of extra joint load if alignment slips. Keep shoulders drawn back and away from the ears so the traps do not carry all the weight. The hips will want to sink—guard against this by tightening the lower abdominals and glutes so the spine remains straight. This creates the platform needed for the keystrokes to be precise instead of sloppy. Because the penis length here is in the 5–7 inch range, the orientation will naturally favor shallow and mid-zone clarity without chasing deep entry. Think of the baseline as the scaffolding that lets the angle of the stroke be felt cleanly on her walls.
The effect of a clean baseline is that every Rocking or Angling movement will register on her canal with consistency. A dropped hip will actually angle her wall contact instead of collapsing into her body weight. A raised hip will sweep across her compass walls without losing control. She will feel this as steady, directed stimulation rather than scattered pressure. Cues to watch for at this stage are subtle: a deeper exhale, hips pressing slightly upward into you, or her legs settling more firmly around your waist. These are signs the clarity of your baseline is allowing her to receive the wall contact fully.
It is easy to underestimate how tiring forearm-plank posture can be if you are not attentive to breath. Always pair an inhale with the reset at baseline and exhale as you move into each stroke. This not only stabilizes your torso but also keeps pressure bands at the right ceiling—Light to Medium for early practice. If you push into Hard pressure without a breath anchor, the hips may drop and joints will absorb the force, which risks shoulder and lower back strain. An endomorph trainee must be especially strict here: do not let leverage and mass override finesse. Train the sensation of pressure flowing from exhale, not from muscle strain.
Think of the neutral forearm-plank baseline like a compass stand holding the needle steady. Without it, the sweep of the stroke cannot point accurately to east, north, or south walls. With it, every keystroke finds its place. Spend time in this posture before adding motion. Hold baseline for three full inhale–exhale cycles, noticing which joints feel loaded, and adjust to spread the work evenly. Shoulders, spine, hips, and knees should all feel balanced, not one area collapsing under the rest. Journaling for this orientation can be as simple as writing, “Baseline plank, shallow depth, Light pressure, steady exhale at cycle three.”

===============================================================================================


Module 2 for The Harrare focuses on teaching the individual keystrokes that make up the stroke, treating each one as a trainable building block. With your Endomorph frame and a 5–7 inch size, the goal here is to shape each keystroke into something sustainable, safe on the joints, and tuned to produce maximum wall clarity even at controlled depth.
From a neutral forearm-plank, the first keystroke is the left-hip drop. You lower your left hip toward the canvas so that your shaft angles into her right wall. This is a Rocking action with a subtle Angling component as the head points across her canal. Depth stays in the shallow 80% with a Medium pressure band. Inhale as you stabilize the plank, exhale as you sink the hip. For an Endomorph build, your mass gives natural drive—keep the drop small and controlled to protect the lower back. With a 5–7 inch range, this keystroke will hit her right wall cleanly without needing depth compensation. Her likely cue is a slow exhale or her hips pressing subtly into you. If her breath deepens, you can add one or two degrees more angle, but avoid chasing depth here; wall contact is the priority.
The second keystroke follows as you let the right hip join the left. This sweeps the head across her canal toward the north wall. It is primarily Rocking with a strong horizontal Angling component. Pressure can stay Medium, with depth remaining shallow-to-mid at about 80–85% depending on her openness. Inhale as the hips start to level, exhale as the sweep carries across. For Endomorph mechanics, you’ll feel the load spread evenly across the forearms and shoulders—maintain elbow integrity by not sinking into the joints. The 5–7 inch length allows this sweep to touch the upper arc of her canal without jamming the cervix. Watch for a pelvic curl or a pause in her body—both show that the north wall contact is landing. If she stills, stay for two cycles before resetting.
The third keystroke is the right-hip lift while the left remains low. This brings the sweep back down her canal from north wall to right wall. It is both Rocking and Angling, pivoting the head downward and outward. Depth should be shallow again at 80%, pressure Light-to-Medium depending on sensitivity. Exhale as you raise the hip, inhale to stabilize in neutral. For an Endomorph, engage core support so the lift is not done by torqueing the spine. The moderate size range here means the head stays in clean contact with the right wall during the return, giving her a rubbing sensation rather than blunt thrust. Her hips may shift to follow you—note whether she leans right; if she does, your angle is correct.
Finally, the reset keystroke is lifting back into full plank. This motion guides the shaft diagonally from the right wall toward the south wall, closing the loop and re-establishing baseline. It is primarily Rocking with a downward Angling finish. Depth remains shallow at 80%, pressure kept Light, and breath should be steady, inhale through lift, exhale at contact. For an Endomorph frame, resist collapsing the chest; keep the shoulders stacked. With a 5–7 inch shaft, this reset allows a clear, broad sweep that keeps her body engaged without overreaching. She may sigh or press her pelvis up slightly if she feels the south wall contact. That is a cue to linger or reset slower.
The training map for these keystrokes starts with the left-hip drop and right-hip drop practiced separately to engrain directional control. Next comes the joining sweep to the north wall, then the return from north to right. Only once those are clear should you finish with the reset into plank. Each keystroke should be rehearsed at least ten times in isolation before chaining, with breath and pressure aligned. This sequence builds your awareness of Rocking vs. Angling, lets you feel each compass wall distinctly, and prevents you from rushing to rhythm before your body knows how to control the baseline resets. With practice, the keystrokes interlock into the full Harrare logic: down-into-wall, sweep-across, return-sweep, reset—always with breath as the metronome.
For an Endomorph, the main adaptations are depth gating and stamina protection. Limit excursions to the shallow 80% unless her cues show readiness. Keep pressure ceilings at Medium, as your natural weight amplifies the force even when you feel you are holding back. Compass emphasis should stay on right and north walls until tracking confirms her body receives it well. Safeguard your wrists by keeping elbows directly under shoulders and engaging core so the spine doesn’t sag. Hips should move as a unit, not from lumbar torque. A simple journal entry for this phase would read: “Right wall at shallow 80, Medium pressure, hips pressing back at rep six.”
There is one gap in the original stroke description—the precise tempo for chaining sweeps was not defined. For training purposes, I will set a baseline of one full breath cycle per keystroke, with the option to accelerate later once the mechanics are ingrained. This ensures followability and stamina conservation during early modules.

===============================================================================================


Module 3 for The Harrare is where the isolated keystrokes begin to chain into a coherent rhythm. Up until now, you have practiced the left and right Rocking angles and the shallow sweeps as separate elements. Here, your job is to knit them together in a sequence that feels fluid for you and readable for her body, while still respecting the discipline of resets and breath anchors.
Begin from neutral forearm-plank, weight distributed through your arms, spine aligned, hips level. As an Endomorph, you must be careful not to let your core collapse, because the extra load will tempt your hips to sag and blur the compass walls. Inhale steady, then exhale as you drop your left hip into the Rocking diagonal, shallow 80%, sweeping into her right wall. Reset by drawing your hips back to baseline on the next inhale, spine realigned. Exhale and drop the right hip, sliding the head of your penis across to the left wall, again staying shallow and clean. Reset again. Already the pattern begins to form: Rock left, reset, Rock right, reset. Each keystroke stands alone, but now they begin to form a call and response.
The next stage is weaving. Instead of always resetting, allow the second Rock to lead directly into the diagonal sweep across the north wall. Exhale through the movement, Light-to-Medium pressure only, keeping your hips just above collapse. This Angling diagonal shifts the energy from one side to the other and adds continuity. She will likely respond with a deeper breath or a pelvic curl, showing the body is reading the rhythm as a pathway rather than fragments. Return to neutral briefly after the sweep, inhaling to re-center, then start again from the opposite side. The rhythm begins to sound like a drumbeat: Rock, sweep, reset. Rock, sweep, reset. Over time you will shorten the reset pause until the keystrokes roll without conscious breaks.
With a 5–7 inch penis, your advantage is clarity of wall contact. You can float the head across the compass diagonals without over-penetrating or losing the shallow band. This makes the chaining easier to feel and safer to repeat, because every cycle stays inside the 80% shallow comfort zone unless cues invite more. For Endomorph build, stamina is the main challenge—so discipline your breath. One cycle is one full breath: inhale baseline, exhale stroke. This both protects your joints and creates neural memory that links breath to movement. The more consistent your breathing, the quicker your nervous system learns the flow without strain.
Reflection is key at this stage. If she exhales sharply, presses her hips in, or stills beneath you, you know the chaining is landing. If her body goes neutral or drifts away, you may be dropping too deep or rushing the sequence. Adjust by lightening pressure or slowing tempo, then resume the same pattern. A grounded metaphor here is thinking of each stroke like skipping stones across water: the motion must stay shallow, smooth, and rhythmic, otherwise the energy sinks. Journal your trials simply, such as: “Left Rock–North Sweep@6 cycles, hips curl at 4.” These lines keep your experiments clear and repeatable.
This construction phase is where your keystrokes stop being drills and start becoming rhythm. Every cycle starts and ends in neutral plank, every stroke stays tied to the compass and depth map, and every adaptation honors Endomorph leverage and the 5–7 inch gating. With this, you’re ready to step into true Tracking, where the rhythm becomes your probe for feedback.
Ready to proceed to Module 4 for The Harrare with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


===============================================================================================


Module 4 for The Harrare moves you into the Tracking phase, where the shallow 80% zone becomes your testing ground and the SSP loop is applied directly to her body’s feedback.
Begin again from the neutral forearm-plank, shoulders stacked, hips balanced, breath steady. With your Endomorph frame, keep the abdomen slightly engaged to prevent sag and protect the spine. Inhale fully, then exhale as you drop into the first Rocking diagonal, Light-to-Medium pressure, staying in the shallow band. Pause at the compass wall and observe her cues. This is the “Define” step: you choose one wall, one keystroke, and one pressure band. On the next cycle, you “Hypothesize”—decide whether she will respond more strongly if you increase pressure, change angle, or alter tempo. Then you execute a mini-set of three to five repetitions, each tied to a full breath cycle. Track the cues: her breath may deepen, her hips may press in, or she may curl toward you. That’s your data. If her body stills or pulls back, you’ve gone too far in pressure or depth.
Reset after each mini-set by returning hips to neutral plank and inhaling deeply. This reset cleans your nervous system of drift and keeps you honest with the compass. As a man with a 5–7 inch penis, the shallow zone is where you have the most control and clarity. You will notice how the head can glide across the right or left wall cleanly without over-penetrating or bumping the cervix. The shallow Tracking cycles are where she learns to trust the stroke, because every repetition is consistent, measured, and responsive. Your job is not to flow endlessly here, but to experiment. It is like testing different keys in a lock until one turns.
When you find a stroke that lands—her exhale elongates, her hips press in, her pelvic floor grips—you move into “Refine.” That means you repeat that same stroke, Light-to-Medium pressure, three or four cycles, then pull back to neutral and log what happened. Journaling here might sound like: “North wall, shallow, Medium, hips curled at rep three.” This line captures the full SSP cycle: Define the wall, Hypothesize the effect, Track the cue, Refine the stroke. Keep these notes short and consistent; they will give you a map of her body over time.
For Endomorph build, stamina protection is key. Do not extend a Tracking mini-set longer than five reps without a breath reset. Your body carries more load, and staying disciplined in the reset will save your joints and energy. This also keeps the stroke crisp for her. If you drift into lazy pressure or collapse your plank, the clarity of the wall disappears and her feedback fades. Remember: shallow 80% is not about intensity—it is about precision.
By the end of this module, you will be able to use The Harrare not just as a pattern, but as a probe. You will know how to test walls, how to read her cues, and how to adjust depth, pressure, and angle in real time. The shallow band becomes your laboratory, and the SSP loop is your method. This is how you learn her body without guessing, and how you build trust in the stroke.
Ready to proceed to Module 5 for The Harrare with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


===============================================================================================


Module 5 for The Harrare now shifts into Flow, where the keystrokes you built in Tracking begin to link into continuous rhythm across the shallow 80% and, when permitted, into the mid 10%.
Begin again from the neutral forearm-plank, shoulders wide, hips balanced, abdomen slightly engaged to keep your Endomorph frame from sagging into the canvas. Take one long inhale to center, then exhale as you move into the first Rocking diagonal. Instead of pausing after each cycle to refine, now you allow the strokes to roll one into the next. Picture a pendulum swinging between compass walls—your hips drop, angle, and rise in steady sequence, each sweep carrying the head of your penis across a fresh wall. The shallow 80% remains your base. This zone gives you the cleanest wall contact with a 5–7 inch length, keeping every sweep safe and fluid.
Breath anchors keep the rhythm honest. Inhale as you return to neutral, exhale through the sweep. Each breath pairs with one stroke, and that pairing prevents you from rushing or losing structure. Pressure stays in the Light-to-Medium band; you only test into Hard pressure when her cues demand it—hips pressing in, a pelvic curl drawing you deeper, or a sudden stillness as her breath catches. Flow means sustaining this responsiveness without breaking rhythm. Every cycle must return to neutral before beginning the next, even when momentum tempts you to skip the reset. That reset is what keeps the stroke clear rather than sloppy.
For Endomorph build, stamina comes from pacing. Flow does not mean sprinting; it means continuity. Limit each Flow set to twenty to thirty seconds before pulling back to reset in plank and letting your breath catch. Your leverage gives you power, but without these rest pauses, fatigue will dull the walls and you’ll lose her cues. With 5–7 inches, you may also test the mid 10% zone here. To do this, allow one sweep per cycle to ride slightly deeper, guided by her hips curling or pulling you in. If her breath stays open and she presses into you, hold that mid zone for a few cycles before returning to shallow. If she stiffens or exhales sharply, retreat to the shallow immediately.
Reflection during Flow is subtle. You do not pause to journal mid-rhythm; instead, you notice which sweeps consistently draw her response. When you reset, you log a line in your head: “South-to-east diagonal, shallow, Medium, hips pressed in at rep six.” This gives you a shorthand record of what carried best in Flow. Over time, these lines build a map of which keystroke chains are her natural grooves.
By the end of this module, you will have turned The Harrare from a set of isolated keystrokes into a smooth rhythm. The shallow 80% will feel like your home base, and the mid 10% will begin to appear as an optional accent rather than a guess. Flow is where she feels that you are no longer testing her body, but playing it like an instrument.
Ready to proceed to Module 6 for The Harrare with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


===============================================================================================


Module 6 for The Harrare now takes you into the controlled deep option, where you carefully test expansion into the mid and deep 10% zones without sacrificing safety or rhythm.
You begin as always from the forearm-plank neutral, hips square, shoulders wide, core engaged. Take a slow inhale to brace, then exhale as you send the first sweep through the shallow 80%. Once that rhythm feels secure, you allow one sweep per cycle to ride deeper. For a 5–7 inch length, this means sliding the head into the mid 10% zone rather than pressing for full depth. The Endomorph frame gives you natural power, but this is where restraint matters most—let her hips pull you in rather than driving forcefully. A pelvic curl, a stilling of her breath, or her pelvis tilting upward are green lights that her body is ready for depth. A sudden exhale, tightening, or pressing away is your red light to retreat back into shallow.
The motion into depth is more Angling than Rocking. Dropping one hip tilts the head toward the north wall and slightly down, giving you a diagonal path into her mid canal. At this depth, pressure must remain Medium, never Hard, because cervical contact can quickly overwhelm her if you overdrive. Use your breath to control this: inhale in neutral, exhale gently into depth, then inhale as you return to shallow. Each exhale should feel like you are pouring into the depth rather than forcing into it. With repetition, this creates a rhythm where shallow strokes build her arousal and occasional mid entries create spikes of intensity.
Because you are carrying more body weight in plank as an Endomorph, your joints must remain stacked and supported. Keep forearms pressing firmly into the canvas, shoulders over elbows, and hips level in reset. Stamina protection comes from limiting deep tests to no more than three or four per set before resetting fully to shallow. If fatigue sets in, your angle will slip and depth will feel blunt instead of precise. The metaphor here is dipping a ladle into water: the entry should be smooth, controlled, and withdrawn before it clunks against the bottom.
Her cues will tell you whether depth is becoming integration or interruption. If she softens and draws you in, let the mid 10% ride for a few strokes. If she stiffens, pulls back, or exhales sharply, immediately return to shallow. Your job is not to chase depth but to let it appear naturally. With 5–7 inches, you are already capable of stimulating the cervix area at times, but the aim here is mid-zone navigation rather than full deep drilling.
In reflection, you journal the cues and the ratio. A sample line might read: “North wall, mid depth, Medium pressure, pelvic curl at rep three.” This helps you track not only what you attempted, but how her body answered. The SSP loop guides this: define when depth is possible, hypothesize which angle will work, test a mini-set, observe her feedback, and refine by either repeating or retreating. Over weeks, this discipline makes you a master of controlled depth rather than a guesser.
By the close of Module 6, you will have the tools to add depth safely into The Harrare, expanding her range of sensation while protecting her body and your stamina. Depth is not about force but about timing and response. Done correctly, it becomes the accent that makes the Flow feel endless rather than repetitive.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for The Harrare with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


===============================================================================================






Module 7 for The Harrare is about using pinning as a deliberate strategy after orgasm, where you focus on subtle shifts in angle, pressure, and tempo to spark multiples while maintaining control.
You begin from the neutral forearm-plank as always, letting her body settle in the afterglow. The goal here is not large sweeps but micro-angle adjustments that feel like a continuation of the rhythm she just surrendered to. Inhale in stillness, then exhale as you drop one hip lightly, sending the head into the north wall with Medium pressure. Hold there, steady, letting her hips respond. If she presses in, curls her pelvis, or releases a soft exhale, you maintain the angle a few more breaths before shifting slightly. If she stills or tightens, you release back into neutral and try another micro-adjustment. Each adjustment is no more than a finger-width, enough to alter the sensation without breaking her trance.
The Rocking here becomes slower and more weighted, while Angling controls precision. For an Endomorph frame, this means engaging the core to prevent collapsing weight into her hips or shoulders. Distribute force evenly, press forearms firmly into the canvas, and let your breath set the pacing rather than muscular drive. With a 5–7 inch length, the pinning window is your strength: you can target the shallow and mid zones precisely without overreaching into discomfort. Medium pressure is your ceiling, because Hard at this phase will snap her out of receptivity. Imagine it like holding her open with steady warmth rather than pushing deeper—she should feel filled but not forced.
As the cycle continues, you use the SSP loop. Observe how she breathes or moves, tweak angle by shifting your hip a fraction, test a short burst of two to three breaths, then return to neutral to reset. The rhythm may be steady pinning for a few breaths or quickened pulses if her cues tell you she is climbing again. The art lies in doing less but reading more. Her body will tell you if she is opening to another peak, and your role is to hold space with precision rather than chase it with force.
Endomorph stamina management here requires patience. Keep hips aligned, avoid sagging lower back, and return often to baseline for recovery. Short sets of pinning, followed by resets, prevent fatigue and maintain clarity. The metaphor is like keeping a candle flame alive: too much wind snuffs it out, too little movement lets it fade. The right breath-fed touch makes it flare again.
Your journal line at the end of practice might read: “North wall, shallow zone, Medium pressure, soft exhale at rep two.” That single note anchors the session and teaches you which angles reliably reignite her body. Over time, these logs form a map of her post-orgasmic landscapes, giving you mastery over the terrain.
Pinning is where she realizes you can extend her body past what she thought was possible, and where you learn restraint and precision are more powerful than speed. Done with discipline, this becomes the phase where she forgets how many times she came—she only knows you kept her there.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for The Harrare with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


===============================================================================================




Module 8 for The Harrare is your training plan and integration phase, where all the previous pieces are tied into a structured practice routine you can follow without overthinking.
You begin by dedicating four weeks to layering the stroke into your body. In the first week, you focus only on orientation and keystroke isolation, using the forearm plank as your anchor. Each session should be short, with no more than three minutes spent practicing individual keystrokes, followed by resets and breath-focused recovery. For an Endomorph, this is especially important to prevent joint strain and to build stamina gradually. Keep your notes simple in your journal—one line describing wall, angle, pressure, and her cue—and let those logs guide your second week.
In the second week, start chaining two keystrokes together, keeping everything inside the shallow 80%. The goal is to teach your body the rhythm logic without losing posture or burning out. Stay strict with the inhale-to-prepare, exhale-to-execute pattern. When you find her cues—hips pressing in, a soft exhale—anchor that in memory and write it down. This is where you sharpen your listening skills, because Flow later will only be as good as the Tracking you refine now.
By the third week, you allow yourself to run full stroke cycles, linking all keystrokes together into the Harrare’s rhythm. Keep sessions shorter—five minutes of sustained rhythm at most—so you can return to baseline before fatigue makes you sloppy. Flow becomes possible here, but only if you maintain the 80–10–10 depth discipline. With a 5–7 inch length, mid-zone entries are possible but should be rare and always tied to her invitations, like a pelvic curl or hips pulling in. You stay out of deep range because it risks discomfort and wastes stamina.
In the fourth week, add Pinning work. After running a few Flow cycles, you deliberately slow down and hold angles to spark multiples. Use the Observe → Tweak → Test loop here, logging what reliably opens her again. Short bursts, followed by resets, become the training ground for mastery. This week is not about duration but about precision: proving to yourself you can control her body’s response with minimal movement.
Throughout the four weeks, protect your frame. Endomorph structure means you must reset often to protect shoulders, wrists, and hips. Always return to neutral, shake tension out of your arms, and breathe before chaining again. Stamina grows by steady layering, not by pushing past fatigue. If you respect those boundaries, your joints stay fresh, and your clarity on the compass walls improves.
At the end of each session, write one clear line in your journal. For example: “West wall, shallow zone, Medium pressure, hips pressed in at rep six.” Over time, those short sentences become your personal atlas of her body, teaching you which adjustments light her up.
This training plan makes the Harrare more than a stroke—it becomes a practiced weapon of control and finesse. You move from learning angles to embodying rhythm, and from rhythm to mastering her response.
