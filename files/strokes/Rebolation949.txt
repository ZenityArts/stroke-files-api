Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Rebloation Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m stoked to guide you through this program crafted especially for mesomorphs with an extension between 5 and 7 inches. Your physique speaks of balanced strength and explosive athleticism; you’ve got muscle definition and endurance that allow you to execute precise, powerful movements. While your asset is moderate in length, every inch is inherently sensitive and, when harnessed with proper technique, can deliver cumulative, intense stimulation. Today, we’re going to transform your raw power into a finely tuned, cumulative performance with the Rebloation Stroke—a technique that employs sequential hip rotations to build targeted stimulation throughout your partner’s canal.
Picture yourself in your training space—a quiet, dedicated arena where distractions fade away, leaving you 100% focused on perfecting your technique. Feel the reliable, supportive floor under your feet; it mirrors the rock‑solid foundation of your mesomorph build. Take several deep, controlled breaths. With every inhale, draw in concentrated energy; with every exhale, release all residual tension. This is your space, brother—a sanctuary where you harness your natural athleticism and channel it into a performance that transforms every motion into a work of cumulative intimate art.
We begin by modifying the classic missionary position to align perfectly with your mesomorph structure. Assume a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface that’s designed to handle your sturdy frame. This anchoring stance is crucial because it locks your body into a stable position so that every micro‑movement—from the subtle twist of your hips to the final lateral shift—is executed with precision. Your mesomorph body, with its natural balance of strength and agility, gives you the perfect platform to perform rapid yet controlled movements. Every action must be deliberate, ensuring that your powerful force is channeled exactly where it will yield maximum pleasure without overwhelming her sensitive, nerve‑rich areas.
Once you’re secure, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Consider this deliberate insertion as the blueprint for your entire stroke—it establishes the specific alignment, pressure points, and angles that will govern every subsequent move. Your Rebloation Stroke unfolds in a very structured pattern: you start with a deliberate forward push, followed by four individual hip rotations to the right; then you perform four individual hip rotations to the left; and finally, you complete the cycle with one additional lateral shift to the left. With each individual hip rotation, the hilt of your penis applies consistent pressure as it “canvasses” a defined segment of your partner’s vaginal opening—on the right side, moving from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, and on the left, from the north‑western to the south‑western segment—while the head of your penis adapts its orientation, first directing stimulation toward one vaginal wall and then shifting to the opposite side. This sequential layering of stimulation is what makes the Rebloation Stroke uniquely cumulative.
Because you’re a mesomorph with an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you have natural muscularity and control, but precision is key. You must ensure that about 80% of your force is dedicated to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), while the remaining 20% is carefully balanced between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This balanced force allocation forms the cornerstone of building cumulative stimulation that intensifies with each successive rotation.
This introduction sets the stage, brother. Here, you learn how to establish your environment, adopt the proper posture, and channel your natural mesomorph power into a Rebloation Stroke that transforms raw strength into a finely choreographed performance. Today marks the beginning of turning your potential into a true work of intimate art—a performance that celebrates the precision of each movement and the cumulative pleasure achieved with every rotation. Welcome, brother—your journey to mastery starts now.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, and Flow
Alright, brother, let’s dive deep into the fundamental principles that underpin the Rebloation Stroke. These concepts form the solid foundation upon which your technique is built—they ensure that every motion you make is both precise and cumulative. We’re talking about the 80‑10‑10 principle, the Sexual Scientific Process (complete with tracking and flow), and how these elements work together to give you a roadmap for continuous improvement.
Imagine the 80‑10‑10 principle as your force‑distribution blueprint. The idea is simple: approximately 80% of your applied force should be focused on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because that is where the highest concentration of nerve endings resides, making it the most sensitive and the epicenter of pleasure. The remaining 20% of your force isn’t wasted—it’s split evenly, so that 10% is directed to the mid‑depth zone (roughly 3 to 5 inches) and 10% to the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as a mesomorph with an extension between 5 and 7 inches, this means that although your natural athleticism allows you to reach deeper, the bulk of your energy must always be concentrated on that ultra‑sensitive shallow area. This focused, balanced distribution prevents overstimulation in one area and instead creates a cumulative effect that builds layer upon layer with each repetition.
Now, let’s look at the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic, step‑by‑step method for refining your technique over time. This process begins by clearly defining your goal. With the Rebloation Stroke, your objective might be to maximize the cumulative impact of each individual hip rotation, ensuring that every single move adds a precise layer of stimulation. Once your goal is set, you form a hypothesis. Perhaps you suspect that a slightly slower rotation or a minute adjustment in your hip angle will enhance the pressure distribution. Then comes the tracking phase. In tracking, you methodically perform around 30 rotations for each segment of your stroke while paying close attention to your body’s cues—engaging your strong core and pelvic floor—and, importantly, listening to your partner’s feedback. Notice her deep, rhythmic breathing, the subtle shifts in her posture, and any gentle verbal signals that indicate which movements work best. Tracking serves as your immediate, real‑time feedback loop, allowing you to tweak and adjust your technique until every movement is optimized for maximum cumulative stimulation.
Once you’ve gathered sufficient data from tracking, you naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical state where every micro‑movement—from your deliberate forward push to each precise hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically, without conscious thought, as though you were performing a perfectly choreographed dance. In flow, your body moves with instinctual precision, delivering the exact pressure and timing that your tracking has helped you perfect, which in turn allows cumulative stimulation to build effortlessly with each cycle.
For the Rebloation Stroke, the keystrokes—the individual hip rotations and the final lateral shift—are not separate drills but are inherent to the movement pattern. The key to training them is to isolate each rotation and practice it until it becomes second nature. Through dedicated, repetitive practice, you build the muscle memory required so that every repetition adds to that cumulative, balanced stimulation.
To sum it up, brother: • The 80‑10‑10 principle makes sure that 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone, with the remaining 20% evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep layers. • The Sexual Scientific Process—with its clear goal setting, hypothesis formation, rigorous tracking, and achieving flow—provides a systematic roadmap for continuously refining your technique. • Drilling the specific keystrokes of the Rebloation Stroke (those individual hip rotations and the final lateral shift) builds the precision needed to deliver cumulative stimulation flawlessly.
These principles are the foundation of your training, ensuring that every movement you make is scientifically sound and executed with artistic finesse.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Rebloation Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, now let’s break down the Rebloation Stroke step by step so that you have an exact, detailed blueprint for transforming your natural mesomorph agility and moderate extension into a performance of cumulative, targeted stimulation. The Rebloation Stroke is performed in the classic missionary position—on top in a modified plank with your knees securely planted on the canvas, and your penis inserted at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Once you’re in position, the stroke unfolds in a very structured sequence: you first execute four individual hip rotations to the right, then follow up with four individual hip rotations to the left, and finally, you complete the stroke with one decisive lateral shift to the left.
Let’s begin with the forward push, which is the foundation of your stroke. From your firmly anchored position, push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head in a smooth, deliberate movement. As you advance, feel the top shelf of your extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Since your asset is moderate in length (between 5 and 7 inches), the 80‑10‑10 principle instructs you to focus roughly 80% of your force on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), with the remaining force balanced evenly between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This forward push sets the cumulative base upon which all subsequent hip rotations add extra layers of stimulation.
Next, enter the first phase of the rotation sequence by performing four individual hip rotations to the right. For each rotation to the right, focus on letting the hilt of your penis apply steady, controlled pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment of your partner’s vaginal opening down to the south‑eastern segment. At the same time, watch as the head of your penis begins by directing pressure toward the southwestern wall and then slowly shifts to the north‑western wall as your rotation continues. Each rotation is a distinct keystroke that contributes to the cumulative stimulation, building a layered effect with each precise movement.
After completing the four right rotations, seamlessly transition to the second phase—four individual hip rotations to the left. In these rotations, mirror the process: as you move to the left, the hilt of your penis canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head initially points toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall with each rotation. This alternating pattern ensures that cumulative stimulation is evenly distributed throughout her vaginal canal, creating a balanced, rhythmic cycle.
Finally, round out the stroke with one lateral shift to the left. This final movement further consolidates the cumulative stimulation by engaging any areas that might not have been fully reached by the hip rotations. Throughout every step, each movement is carefully controlled and executed according to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that approximately 80% of your force remains focused on the shallow, ultra-sensitive area, while the remaining 20% is equally spread across the deeper zones.
This deconstruction gives you a clear, step‑by‑step roadmap for the Rebloation Stroke. It takes your natural mesomorph agility and moderate extension and translates them into a series of meticulously coordinated movements that build cumulative, targeted stimulation with every precise hip rotation and lateral shift.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each individual component of the Rebloation Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with flawless precision. With your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you’re built for dynamic, controlled movements—but every hip rotation must be performed with laser-like accuracy. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and drill it repeatedly until it’s firmly embedded in your muscle memory, always mindful of the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Start with the forward push drill. In your modified missionary position, with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface that accommodates your powerful build, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle, then slowly execute a forward push toward your partner’s head. Concentrate on the sensation: feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is moderate, direct about 80% of your force onto the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. Repeat this forward push slowly and methodically until the movement becomes smooth, steady, and completely automatic.
Next, isolate the hip rotation drills. Begin with a single rotation to the right. From your secure position, initiate one deliberate hip rotation to the right and focus on how the hilt of your penis applies steady pressure by canvassing from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, observe how the head first directs pressure toward the southwestern wall, then gradually shifts to the north‑western wall. Execute one complete rotation slowly, then pause, reset, and repeat for at least 30 repetitions until the motion is perfectly ingrained. Then, switch to a single rotation to the left. As you rotate left, feel the hilt move smoothly from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head initially directs its pressure toward the southeastern wall before transitioning to the north‑eastern wall. Alternate these rotations until you can seamlessly move between right and left, with every move strictly following the 80‑10‑10 principle.
After you’ve mastered the individual hip rotations, work on the final lateral shift drill. Slowly shift your entire body laterally to the left, ensuring that the movement is controlled and that your force distribution remains consistent with the 80‑10‑10 guideline. Repeat this lateral shift until it naturally becomes fluid and in sync with the rotations.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing. Each deep inhale supplies energy for the next movement, and every deliberate exhale creates a smooth transition between drills. By rigorously repeating these keystrokes—the forward push, the individual right and left hip rotations, and the lateral shift—you build the muscle memory and precision essential to delivering cumulative stimulation flawlessly with your Rebloation Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Rebloation Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance, with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your focus entirely on linking every micro‑movement into an unbroken, rhythmic sequence. In this integrated cycle, you’ll combine your deliberate forward push with the sequence of four hip rotations to the right, followed by four hip rotations to the left, and then finish with one precise lateral shift to complete the stroke.
Begin with the forward push. From your secure, anchored position, insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push, executed in strict compliance with the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensures that about 80% of your force is concentrated on the ultra‑sensitive shallow zone, laying a cumulative foundation for the following movements.
Immediately after the forward push, move into the rotational phase by executing four individual hip rotations to the right. As you rotate, focus on the hilt steadily canvassing from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head adjusts its angle—from initially pressing toward the southwestern wall to shifting to the north‑western wall. Each right rotation builds incrementally on the cumulative stimulation.
Then, transition seamlessly into the left rotation phase. Perform four individual hip rotations to the left, during which the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, and the head initially directs its force toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. This balanced, alternating pattern ensures that stimulation is evenly distributed across her vaginal canal.
Finally, conclude the sequence with one controlled lateral shift to the left. This final movement further reinforces the cumulative effect by ensuring that any areas not fully engaged by the rotations receive their share of stimulation. Every movement within your sequence adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle—approximately 80% of your force is applied to the shallow, highly sensitive zone, while the remaining 20% is balanced across the mid‑depth and deep areas.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout the sequence; every deep inhale fuels your next movement, and every controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions between the forward push, hip rotations, and lateral shift. With each complete cycle, your Rebloation Stroke evolves into a continuous, fluid performance that transforms your natural mesomorph agility and moderate extension into a meticulously orchestrated display of cumulative, targeted stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where every micro‑movement of your Rebloation Stroke is meticulously refined until your performance becomes a seamlessly executed masterpiece. With your well‑balanced mesomorph build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, every detail is crucial—especially during each individual hip rotation. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains your guiding star, ensuring that roughly 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you execute the integrated sequence, pay close attention to the quality and consistency of every movement. During your forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region, and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When you perform your four right and four left hip rotations, observe how the hilt canvasses each segment of her vaginal opening and note how the head adjusts its pressure—first pressing toward one wall, then shifting to the opposite wall. This is where tracking becomes absolutely essential. Each repetition provides immediate, real‑time feedback—listen carefully to her deep, rhythmic breathing, watch for subtle shifts in her posture, and be acutely attuned to any soft verbal cues that reveal which aspects of your stroke are delivering the optimal cumulative stimulation. Tracking serves as your critical feedback loop, enabling you to adjust your speed, angle, and force with pinpoint precision.
Once you’ve collected sufficient tracking data—ideally around 30 repetitions per phase—you naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical condition where every micro‑movement—from your deliberate forward push to each meticulously executed hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically in perfect rhythm. In flow, your body intuitively delivers the exact pressure and timing that tracking has helped you hone, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with every cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is essential during this phase: every deep inhale primes your next move, and every measured exhale smooths the transitions. If any movement appears even slightly off, pause, re‑track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is flawless.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a disciplined, structured training program designed to reinforce every element of your Rebloation Stroke while simultaneously strengthening your core and overall stability. With your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you have an ideal blend of power, agility, and control. This routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that consistently delivers cumulative, targeted stimulation every time.
Begin by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where your focus is entirely on mastering your technique. Every training session should start with an extensive warm‑up specifically tailored to your mesomorph body. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these muscle groups are essential for stability and control, ensuring that every movement is executed with exact precision. Visualize each stretch as lighting the internal engine of your body, priming every muscle and joint for the intense, focused drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a determined, positive tone for the session.
Next, move into your specialized drills. Begin with the forward push drill in your modified missionary position. Carefully insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and practice a slow, deliberate forward push toward your partner’s head. Since your extension is moderate in this range, concentrate about 80% of your force on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive zone. Once you have mastered this forward push, isolate the individual hip rotations. Start with the right rotations—practice each rotation slowly and with complete control until the hilt consistently canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment while the head transitions smoothly from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. Aim for at least 30 repetitions until the movement is thoroughly ingrained. Then, mirror the process with left hip rotations until you can execute them seamlessly. Finally, drill the concluding lateral shift until it melds naturally with the rotations. Alternate these drills until every component of the Rebloation Stroke is indelibly etched into your muscle memory.
Throughout your session, maintain deep, controlled breathing to support smooth transitions and precision. Supplement your practice with targeted core-strengthening exercises—such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills—because a strong core is the anchor for every rapid movement. And be sure to keep a detailed training journal. Record each session, note the number of repetitions, document any adjustments you experiment with, and capture her feedback. This journal is a critical element of the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to track progress and continuously refine your technique until it reaches perfection.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—the pinnacle of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Rebloation Stroke converges into one seamless, flawless performance. In this final module, your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and your extension between 5 and 7 inches come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of mastery that is both scientifically refined and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified missionary stance—with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface, your core fully engaged, and your mind dialed into perfection. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that around 80% of your force is directed toward the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is meticulously balanced to stimulate the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately following the forward push, transition into the hip rotation phase by executing four individual hip rotations to the right. With each rotation, concentrate on the hilt steadily canvassing from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head shifts its focus from directing pressure toward the southwestern wall to moving toward the north‑western wall. Next, seamlessly move into four individual hip rotations to the left—mirroring the process so that the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, while the head transitions from initially pressing toward the southeastern wall to finally shifting to the north‑eastern wall. Finally, complete the cycle with one controlled lateral shift to the left, ensuring that the cumulative stimulation reaches every area of her canal.
Throughout the integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale provides the energy for the next precise movement, and every controlled exhale creates smooth transitions. If at any point a movement feels off—if a rotation isn’t perfectly executed or the pressure distribution isn’t balanced—pause, re-track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is flawless.
The ultimate goal is to reach a state of natural flow—a condition where every forward push, every hip rotation, and every lateral shift occurs automatically with impeccable precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve that state, your Rebloation Stroke will have evolved into a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers the targeted, cumulative stimulation that drives her to climax.
