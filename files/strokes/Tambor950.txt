Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Tambor Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to guide you through this program designed specifically for mesomorphs with an asset above 7 inches. Your physique is a picture of balanced strength and explosive power—a muscular, well‑proportioned frame that provides you with exceptional control and endurance. With your extended asset, you have an incredible reach, which—when combined with the right technique—can deliver stimulation that is both deep and intensely cumulative. Today, we’ll learn how to channel your raw power into a Tambor Stroke that integrates deliberate forward motion with rapid, precise hip rotations to create a dynamic rhythm that stimulates every sensitive zone.
Imagine yourself stepping into your personal training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions simply vanish and your sole focus is on mastering your craft. Feel the firm, supportive floor beneath your feet; it mirrors the unwavering stability of your mesomorph build. Take a few deep, controlled breaths; with each inhale, draw in pure, concentrated energy, and with each exhale, release every trace of tension. This arena is yours, brother—a space where your natural athleticism is refined into an intimate art form.
We begin by adapting the classic missionary position to suit your mesomorph structure. Assume a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that’s built to support your powerful frame. This foundational stance is critical because it anchors your entire body, ensuring that every micro‑movement—from the subtle sway of your hips to the swift, rapid rotations—is executed with deliberate precision. Your defined, muscular physique not only generates impressive force but also gives you the natural stability to control it. Every shift must be finely tuned so that your force is delivered exactly where it’ll bring maximum pleasure without overwhelming her delicate, nerve‑rich areas.
Once you’re securely anchored, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Think of this deliberate insertion as your blueprint—it sets the exact angles and pressure points that will govern your Tambor Stroke. Your journey kicks off with a smooth, deliberate forward push. As you drive your body forward toward her head, feel the top shelf of your extended asset glide gracefully over her clitoral region while the head stays in constant, purposeful contact with her “south wall.” With your asset above 7 inches, you’re capable of deep, expansive reach, but remember to adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle—about 80% of your applied force should focus on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), with the remaining 20% evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This precise force allocation is the cornerstone of cumulative, balanced stimulation.
After establishing that solid forward push, you transition into the signature phase of the Tambor Stroke. At this stage, you choose your directional mode—whether to operate “Tambor going right” or “Tambor going left.” In Tambor going right, you engage in fast‑paced hip rotations to the right. In this mode, the hilt of your penis rapidly canvasses the vaginal opening from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment, while the head swiftly points toward the southwestern wall before shifting to the north‑western wall, delivering an explosive, cumulative effect. In Tambor going left, the process is mirrored—the hilt canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, with the head first pointing toward the southeastern wall and then shifting to the north‑eastern wall. These rapid rotations demand both speed and precision—qualities you naturally possess—ensuring that cumulative stimulation builds rapidly and remains perfectly controlled.
This introduction lays the groundwork, brother. It shows you how to set up your training environment, adopt the ideal posture, and channel your natural mesomorph power and extended asset into a Tambor Stroke that transforms raw force into a masterfully controlled performance of cumulative pleasure. Welcome, brother—today, we begin turning your natural potential into a true work of intimate art.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Alright, brother, let’s dive into the technical framework behind your Tambor Stroke. This is where we meld scientific principles with the art of intimate movement to ensure every detail is deliberate and cumulative.
First, the 80‑10‑10 principle is your force-distribution blueprint. Picture this: about 80% of your force should be concentrated on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because this area packs the highest density of nerve endings and is the most sensitive. The remaining 20% is not wasted; it’s evenly split, with 10% directed toward the mid‑depth zone (roughly 3 to 5 inches) and 10% toward the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, as a mesomorph with an extension above 7 inches, this means that while your extended reach allows you to stimulate deeper areas, the majority of your power must be precisely focused on that ultra-sensitive shallow zone. This ensures that every movement builds cumulative, balanced stimulation without overloading any one spot.
Next is the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic, step-by-step method to fine-tune your technique. It begins with clearly defining your goal; perhaps your aim is to maximize the intensity and speed of your fast-paced hip rotations in the Tambor Stroke. With that goal in mind, you form a hypothesis—maybe you think that a slightly quicker rotation will enhance cumulative stimulation, or that adjusting your angle during rotation could make a significant impact. Then comes tracking: perform around 30 repetitions for each directional mode and closely observe your body’s cues (engage your core, activate your pelvic floor) and, most importantly, listen to your partner’s feedback—her deep, rhythmic breathing, subtle posture shifts, and soft verbal cues will tell you exactly what’s working. Tracking is your immediate feedback loop, allowing you to adjust your technique in real time for maximum cumulative effect.
Once you’ve gathered enough data through tracking, you enter a state of flow—an almost magical condition where every micro‑movement, from your smooth forward push to your rapid hip rotations, occurs seamlessly and automatically. In flow, your body delivers the exact pressure and timing refined by tracking, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with every repetition.
Finally, the tap keystroke drill is critical for developing lateral precision. Picture yourself in a stable forearm plank; slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, and then return smoothly to center. This exercise builds the muscle memory and pelvic strength needed to execute every lateral move with pinpoint accuracy. Practiced with deep, controlled “stroke breathing” and incorporated with kegeling exercises, the tap keystroke drill ensures your lateral moves always adhere perfectly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
So, brother, in summary: the 80‑10‑10 principle ensures that 80% of your force is applied to the ultra-sensitive shallow zone, with the remaining 20% evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep layers; the Sexual Scientific Process—with its clear goal setting, hypothesis formation, rigorous tracking, and natural flow—provides a roadmap for constant refinement; and the tap keystroke drill hones the lateral precision essential for cumulative stimulation. With these principles firmly established, you’re ready to break down the Tambor Stroke into its individual keystrokes and master each element with scientific precision.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Tambor Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Tambor Stroke into every deliberate, detailed movement so that you have a precise blueprint for converting your raw power into rapid, cumulative stimulation. The Tambor is performed in the classic missionary position—with you on top in a modified plank (knees on the canvas) and your penis inserted at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Once inserted, you choose the directional mode: you operate the stroke either “Tambor going right” or “Tambor going left,” with each mode employing fast-paced hip rotations to generate dynamic stimulation.
Start with the forward push. From your anchored position, drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head with a smooth, deliberate push. Feel the top shelf of your extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” In your case, with an extension above 7 inches, the 80‑10‑10 principle requires that about 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), with the remaining 20% evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep areas. This forward push sets the stage by establishing a cumulative base for the stroke.
Next comes the directional phase. In “Tambor going right,” you execute fast-paced hip rotations to the right. As you rotate rapidly, the hilt of your penis applies pressure and canvasses the vaginal opening from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment. Simultaneously, the head quickly points toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall, delivering rapid, cumulative stimulation. Alternatively, in “Tambor going left,” the process is mirrored: the hilt canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head first points toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall. These rapid rotations must be executed with speed and precision, ensuring that the cumulative stimulation is built while strictly observing the 80‑10‑10 force distribution.
Training the Tambor Stroke means isolating these keystrokes and drilling them until each becomes second nature. Start by mastering the forward push until it’s smooth and fluid. Then, isolate the fast-paced hip rotations: first, drill the “going right” rotations—focus on performing them rapidly while ensuring that the hilt correctly canvasses the vaginal opening from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment and that the head shifts accurately from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. Next, drill the “going left” rotations with the same precision. Alternate these drills until you can execute them with effortless speed while maintaining control.
Each keystroke—whether it’s the forward push, the rapid right rotations, or the rapid left rotations—is a building block in the Tambor Stroke. By deconstructing the stroke into these individual elements, you create a detailed, step-by-step roadmap that transforms your innate ectomorphic agility and extended reach into a precisely choreographed performance that delivers rapid, cumulative stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each individual component of the Tambor Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with both speed and precision. With your lean, agile ectomorphic build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you’re built for rapid, explosive movements—but every fast-paced rotation must be controlled with pinpoint accuracy. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and drill it repeatedly until it’s deeply ingrained in your muscle memory, always ensuring adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle and using the correct hip rotation details.
Begin with the forward push drill. In your modified missionary position, with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that supports your lean frame, carefully insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle. Then, slowly execute a forward push toward your partner’s head. Focus on a smooth, deliberate motion—feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, intentional contact with her “south wall.” Since your extension is in the 5‑7‑inch range, channel about 80% of your force to the shallow, nerve‑rich area. Repeat this forward push slowly and methodically until you achieve perfectly consistent motion.
Next, focus on lateral shift drills. Start with a right lateral shift. From your forward push position, shift your entire body to the right in a controlled, deliberate manner. Focus on an even, balanced transfer of weight: feel your hilt applying steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates to deliver broad, rhythmic pressure toward her left wall. Integrate the correct hip rotations—perform 2 slow rotations, ensuring that the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment and that the head transitions from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. Drill this movement repeatedly until it becomes automatic and fluid.
Then, practice a left lateral shift drill. Slowly shift to the left—feel your hilt deliver consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening as your shaft rotates to send broad pressure toward her right wall. As you execute this left shift, perform 2 slow hip rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and the head moves from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall. Alternate these lateral shifts until you can effortlessly move between right and left while strictly following the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Now, add the “double down” element to intensify the stimulation. On the right side, after completing a standard right shift, lower your body further in a controlled, deliberate manner to perform a right double down. Focus on amplifying the pressure—feel your hilt apply additional, concentrated force to the right side of her vaginal opening as your shaft continues its broad, rhythmic massage toward her left wall. Drill this double down slowly until you have complete control over the extra pressure. Then, mirror this movement on the left side—execute a left shift followed by a left double down to ensure balanced, cumulative stimulation. Aim for at least 30 repetitions per drill until every micro‑movement is engrained in your muscle memory.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing. With each deep inhale, draw in the focused energy needed for the next precise move; with every deliberate exhale, ensure smooth transitions between drills. Also, integrate the tap keystroke drill into your routine—assume a stable forearm plank, then slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the surface, and return to center. This exercise refines your lateral precision and keeps every movement aligned with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Tambor Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance, with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your focus solely on linking every micro‑movement into an uninterrupted rhythmic cycle. In this integrated sequence, you’ll combine your deliberate forward push with your rapid, controlled hip rotations and dynamic lateral shifts to create a stroke that delivers rapid, cumulative stimulation.
Begin with a deliberate forward push. Insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Feel the top shelf of your extension glide seamlessly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push lays the essential foundation, strictly adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle by focusing about 80% of your force on the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone.
Immediately after the forward push, choose your directional mode. If you opt for “Tambor going right,” transition into fast-paced hip rotations to the right. Execute rapid, controlled rotations—feel the hilt apply pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head rapidly moves from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. Alternatively, if you select “Tambor going left,” perform the mirrored rotations—with the hilt canvassing from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and the head shifting from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall. These fast-paced rotations must always maintain the 80‑10‑10 force distribution so that even at high speed, cumulative stimulation builds effectively.
Throughout the integrated sequence, maintain deep, rhythmic breathing as your internal metronome—each deep inhale fuels your rapid movements, and every controlled exhale smooths transitions between the forward push and the rapid hip rotations. With each complete cycle, your Tambor Stroke becomes a continuous, fluid performance that transforms your natural mesomorph agility and moderate extension into a powerful, cumulative expression of stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase—where every micro‑movement of your Tambor Stroke is honed until your performance is a flawlessly executed masterpiece of rapid, cumulative stimulation. With your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, every detail matters—even during fast-paced hip rotations. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains your guiding star: approximately 80% of your force should be directed at the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, with the remaining force evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep regions.
As you perform your integrated cycle, focus on the quality and consistency of every move. During your forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region, with the head maintaining steady, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When executing your rapid hip rotations—whether going right or left—observe how the hilt and head distribute pressure along her vaginal walls. This is where tracking becomes indispensable. With each repetition, listen intently to her deep, rhythmic breathing, observe any subtle shifts in her posture, and be highly attuned to soft verbal cues that indicate which elements of your stroke are most effective in building cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your immediate feedback loop that allows you to refine your technique through precise, micro‑adjustments.
Once you’ve gathered sufficient feedback—ideally about 30 repetitions per directional mode—you naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical condition where every movement—from your forward push to each rapid hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically in perfect rhythm. In flow, you consistently deliver the exact pressure and speed that tracking has helped you perfect, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with every cycle. Deep, controlled breathing is essential throughout; every deep inhale primes you for the next rapid movement, and every deliberate exhale smooths out the transitions. And if any lateral or rotational move seems even slightly off, pause, track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is flawless.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a disciplined, structured training program designed to reinforce every aspect of your Tambor Stroke while strengthening your core and overall stability. With your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you have a perfect blend of power, endurance, and agility. This routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that consistently delivers rapid, cumulative stimulation.
Start by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are eliminated and your focus is solely on perfecting your technique. Every training session should begin with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your mesomorph body. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these essential muscle groups form the foundation of your stability and control, ensuring that every micro‑movement is executed with perfect precision. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, priming every muscle for the explosive drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a determined, positive tone.
Next, move into specialized drills, starting with the tap keystroke drill. Assume your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that supports your powerful, balanced frame. Practice controlled lateral taps: slowly shift your body laterally until your hip gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. With your extension between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Synchronize each shift with deep, deliberate breathing—inhaling deeply before each movement and exhaling slowly as you return. Integrate kegeling exercises with every repetition to further strengthen your pelvic floor and enhance control. Aim for at least 30 precise repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke drill becomes second nature.
Once you’ve mastered the tap keystroke, integrate it with your forward push and rapid hip rotation drills. Practice a controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by drills for fast-paced hip rotations in your preferred directional mode (right or left). Focus on executing these rapid rotations with speed and precise control—the hilt must properly canvas the correct vaginal segment (for right rotations, from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment; for left rotations, from the north‑western to the south‑western segment), and the head must shift accurately (from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall for right rotations, or from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall for left rotations). Drill these combined movements repeatedly until every transition is smooth and your technique consistently adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Supplement your training with targeted core-strengthening exercises (planks, abdominal crunches, dynamic stability drills) because your core is the anchor that ensures every movement is executed with maximum precision. Finally, maintain a detailed training journal where you record every session, note the number of repetitions, document any adjustments, and capture her feedback. This journal is an essential tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, helping you track progress and continually refine your technique until perfection is achieved.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—the pinnacle of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Tambor Stroke merges into one continuous, seamless performance. In this final module, your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and your extension between 5 and 7 inches come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of intimate mastery that is scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified plank—with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core fully engaged, and your mind completely tuned for precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your extension glide effortlessly over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that about 80% of your force is focused on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is meticulously balanced to stimulate deeper layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your chosen hip. Slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, then return smoothly to center. Focus intently on the sensation—observe how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening, and note how your shaft rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. Integrate the correct hip rotation details: if shifting to the left, perform 2 slow rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, with the head moving from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall; if shifting to the right, execute 2 slow rotations where the hilt travels from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, with the head shifting from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. If any lateral movement feels off, pause and isolate that component, and drill it until both your internal cues and her subtle feedback confirm perfection.
Then, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position and allows you to gather precise internal feedback. As you push upward, contract your core and engage your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for her responses. Her deep, steady breathing and soft verbal cues indicate whether your movement is perfectly on target. If you sense that the cumulative stimulation isn’t at its peak, make small, mindful adjustments—tweaking your lateral angle or the pace of your forward push—and meticulously track those refinements with the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your adjustments, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps with correct hip rotations, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one rhythmic, unified performance. Then mirror the complete cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced, cumulative stimulation throughout her entire vaginal canal. The ultimate goal is to reach a state of natural flow—a condition where every movement occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve that state, your Tambor Stroke will have transformed into a continuous, fluid masterpiece—one that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers the precise, targeted stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every rapid hip rotation, every lateral shift, and every microscopic adjustment is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and your extension between 5 and 7 inches will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Tambor Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Tambor Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
