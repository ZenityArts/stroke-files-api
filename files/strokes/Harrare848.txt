Module 1 of the Harrare is about grounding yourself in orientation and body setup so that every keystroke later has a stable foundation. Begin by lowering into a forearm plank above her, with your knees supported on the canvas. For an endomorph frame, distribute weight carefully through the forearms and knees so that the shoulders and spine stay long and the hips hover in a steady line. The penis enters at a shallow diagonal, with depth limited to eighty percent of the canal because of your below-five-inch length. This ensures that wall contact is clear, consistent, and not overextended. Inhale to prepare each movement, and exhale through the action, always returning to this neutral baseline between keystrokes. This rhythm keeps your body protected and her sensations distinct.
As you settle into plank, be mindful of joint load. Endomorph leverage means your weight can accumulate quickly at the shoulders and wrists if you sag, so think of stacking your joints in one line—forearms under shoulders, spine aligned, hips not drifting too low. Use your breath as both anchor and brake: inhale to hold posture, exhale when you release into a hip drop or sweep. This control prevents overbearing pressure inside her, especially important with shorter length where every degree of angle carries more intensity against her walls. She will feel steadier strokes and you will preserve stamina, able to sustain cycles without collapse. If her breathing deepens or her hips press upward, you are reading her cues correctly; if she stiffens or stills, lighten the load by adjusting angle or tempo.
Depth control is central at this stage. With below-five-inch length, the sweet spot is the shallow band of her canal where the head of your penis makes the most consistent contact with side and north walls. Staying here not only maximizes sensation for her but also reduces wasted effort for you. Aim for Light-to-Medium pressure as the ceiling, unless her hips draw you in, which is a signal to hold a little longer or angle slightly deeper. The exhale will guide you into these controlled moments, while your inhale prepares you to reset to neutral plank. A simple metaphor here is to think of the neutral plank as the shoreline: every sweep out into her canal should eventually wash back to this steady baseline, keeping you from drifting out of control.
This orientation module is not about performing the full stroke, but about learning how to protect your body, respect depth limits, and establish a reliable breathing and baseline rhythm. Journal what you notice in shorthand to build awareness. For example: “Left hip drop, shallow, Light, hips pressed in at rep six.” These short notes will train your attention and create a record of partner responses over time.

=========================================================================================




Module 2 of the Harrare moves you from posture awareness into the breakdown of the keystrokes themselves, training them one by one as building blocks. You start each keystroke from the neutral forearm plank you built in Module 1, with weight distributed carefully through your arms and knees, spine aligned, and hips balanced. For an endomorph with a shorter length, this alignment ensures you maintain leverage without collapsing into your shoulders or hips, which would bury depth and blur wall clarity. Think of neutral plank as the base note in a song; each keystroke is a chord struck against it, but you always return to the base.
The first keystroke is the left hip drop. From baseline, inhale, then exhale as your left hip lowers toward the canvas. This is primarily a Rocking action with a subtle Angling component, because your penis head points rightward and makes Light-to-Medium contact with the right wall in the shallow 80% zone. She will feel a side pressure that is steady and distinct, often leading her to breathe deeper or nudge her hips toward you. Watch for that signal before holding any longer. For your frame, keep the pressure Light, since endomorph leverage can press too hard if unguarded. Journal an example as: “Right wall shallow, Light, hips shifted in at rep five.”
The second keystroke is the right hip join, where the right hip lowers to meet the left, sweeping the head of the penis leftward across her canal toward the north wall. This combines Rocking and Angling, making her feel a glide from side to ceiling, still in the shallow-to-mid range. Keep pressure Medium only if she presses in, otherwise stay Light to preserve stamina. With shorter length, the north wall is best reached on a diagonal angle rather than straight depth. She may respond with a soft exhale or stillness here, cues that the sweep is landing well. Adjust tempo if her body relaxes—sometimes slowing to let her linger on the contact intensifies the effect.
The third keystroke is the right hip lift, where the right hip rises back to neutral while the left hip stays low. This causes the head of the penis to sweep back across from the north wall to the right wall, with more Rocking than Angling. Breath guides this cycle: inhale to steady, exhale as you raise. She feels the pendulum swing of pressure across her canal, and you should track whether she curls her pelvis forward in response. If she does, extend the sweep by a beat; if she stiffens, reduce pressure to Light and reset.
The fourth keystroke is the neutral reset, where both hips lift back to baseline and the penis glides between right wall and south wall. This is a short Rocking action, Light pressure, fully in shallow zone, and best used as a transition point. Think of this like pulling the bow back across a violin string to reset the next note—necessary to keep the rhythm clean. She will often soften here, releasing a small breath, which confirms the stroke is balancing intensity with relief.
The full cycle mirrors to the other side, beginning with the right hip drop toward the canvas. Exhale through the drop, letting the head angle left into her left wall, shallow 80%. With shorter length, angle precision matters more than depth—stay Light so she feels clarity rather than blunt force. If her hips press up, maintain position and ride the cue; if she goes still, use the SSP loop by pulling back, observing, then testing again at a slightly lighter angle.
The next keystroke is the left hip join, sliding across her canal from left wall toward the north wall. This uses both Rocking and Angling, giving her a sweeping arc she can follow with her breath. Here, Medium pressure works well if her cues are strong, but the endomorph frame should guard against leaning too heavily, which could blur sensitivity. Reflection here is about pacing: a longer sweep creates more build, while a quicker pass may tease.
Then comes the left hip lift, sweeping from north wall back to left wall, another Rocking action that sharpens clarity along the side. Watch for her pelvic curl or hip pull as confirmation. End with the neutral reset, both hips lifted, sliding the head between left wall and south wall before returning to baseline. This completes the mirrored cycle, giving balance across her canal.
Your keystroke training map should focus first on mastering single hip drops left and right, because these establish wall clarity and stamina control. Once you can hold those drops without collapsing posture or overshooting pressure, add the hip joins to learn how to sweep across walls with controlled Rocking and Angling. The hip lifts and resets then close the loop, teaching you to move fluidly while always returning to baseline. By practicing in this sequence, you stack clarity before flow, creating muscle memory that will later carry into rhythm without effort.
Ready to proceed to Module 3 for The Harrare with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches?


=========================================================================================


Module 3 of the Harrare takes the keystrokes you trained in isolation and begins chaining them together into mini-flows. The purpose here is to feel how left-side and right-side cycles interlock when you carry them one after the other, always returning to neutral baseline before switching sides. For an endomorph frame with shorter length, this stage is where discipline matters most—if you drift too deep or collapse weight into your hips, you’ll lose the precision that makes each sweep distinct. Stay clean, stay shallow, and let angle do the work, not brute pressure.
You begin with the left-hip drop into right wall, then directly add the right-hip join into the sweep toward north wall. Inhale at neutral, exhale on the drop, inhale again as you prepare, exhale through the join. This keeps your breathing steady and your tempo smooth. She will likely feel this as a side-to-ceiling arc, a broad sweep that lights up multiple walls at once. Watch for her hips rolling forward or her thighs tightening—that’s a cue to linger at the edge of the sweep before resetting.
From there, carry on with the right-hip lift back across to the right wall and finish with the neutral reset gliding between right wall and south wall. This completes a full left-side loop. Without pausing, transition to the mirrored right-side cycle: right-hip drop into left wall, left-hip join sweeping across to north wall, left-hip lift back to left wall, and neutral reset toward south wall. Each cycle breathes out as the hips move, breathes in as they return to baseline, keeping your stamina aligned with your frame.
At this stage, tempo should stay slow and deliberate. Think of each keystroke like one stroke of a paintbrush—you want each line to be visible, not smeared. If she exhales sharply or presses her hips upward, allow the sweep to pause or repeat before you switch sides. If she stiffens or shifts away, lighten pressure, shorten depth, and slow tempo to give her nervous system a reset. Reflection here is crucial: you’re not just moving hips, you’re learning how her body feeds back into your rhythm.
For Body Type: Endomorph, guard against leaning weight too far forward or letting the belly drag depth past the shallow 80% zone. Always anchor shoulders and forearms so your hips can pivot without strain. For Penis Size: Below 5 inches, you’re relying on compass clarity more than depth—so aim diagonals carefully and let Rocking do the stimulation instead of brute penetration. Stamina protection here comes from not rushing; steady exhale keeps muscles from gassing out.
A simple journaling sentence might read: “Left cycle complete, shallow-north sweep, Medium pressure, hips rolled in on rep six.” This kind of short reflection locks in both mechanics and her response without overthinking.
Would you like me to generate Module 4 for The Harrare now, building on this chaining stage into Flow rhythm?


=========================================================================================


Module 4 of the Harrare takes the chained keystrokes and shifts them into the Tracking Phase, where you apply the SSP loop deliberately in the shallow 80%. The purpose here is to sharpen awareness, test small variations, and log feedback so you can refine the stroke into something both sustainable and responsive. This is where discipline turns into data.
You begin every set from neutral baseline in forearm-plank, hips steady, shoulders anchored. Choose one compass wall—start with right wall, shallow 80%, Rocking quality. Inhale at baseline, exhale as you drop hips into the wall with Light-to-Medium pressure, then return to neutral on inhale. Run a set of six to eight repetitions, staying shallow, and observe. If she breathes deeper, curls her pelvis up, or keeps pressing into you, note it as a positive cue. If she stiffens or pulls back, log it as resistance. Between sets, pause at baseline and reflect before repeating.
Your job is not to guess, but to hypothesize. For example: “Does slightly more angle on the north diagonal wake up a stronger pelvic curl?” Then you test it for a few reps, watch her body, and record the result in one short line. A sample might be: “North diagonal, shallow, Light pressure, hips pressed in on rep five.” This is the kind of clear journaling that builds your map.
For an endomorph frame, it’s easy to sink weight too far forward in this stage—guard your core so you don’t drop hips beyond shallow 80%. This ensures clarity of feedback rather than drowning it in depth. With below 5 inches, staying disciplined at shallow wall is your advantage: less chance of cervix interference, more wall surface contact, and a sharper compass line she can feel. The clarity of your angle is what gives her nervous system something distinct to respond to.
Cycle through walls one at a time, always returning to neutral, and give each wall at least two sets before moving on. Keep breath steady, exhale on movement, inhale on reset, and resist the urge to rush toward flow. Tracking is patient. Think of it as laying out the foundation stones of a path—you want each stone placed clearly so she never trips.
Would you like me to proceed to Module 5 for The Harrare, moving from Tracking into sustained Flow rhythm?


=========================================================================================


Module 5 of the Harrare is where you take the clean compass clarity built during Tracking and slide it into Flow. This means you are no longer running isolated sets of tests, but stringing them together into a steady rhythm that she can melt into. Flow isn’t about pushing harder; it’s about sustaining a groove where angle, depth, and pressure hold steady long enough for her nervous system to entrain and open.
Start in forearm-plank with your neutral baseline locked, shoulders grounded and hips level. Choose the wall or diagonal that gave you the strongest positive cues in Tracking—maybe her hips pressed in more on the right wall or her breath deepened at the north diagonal. That’s your Flow anchor. Inhale at baseline, exhale as you drop hips into the compass line with consistent Medium pressure, and glide back to baseline on inhale. Do not switch walls every few reps—hold the wall steady for a long run, twenty or more strokes, letting her body soak into the repetition.
At shallow 80% depth, your below 5-inch length means you have sharper clarity in wall contact, which makes Flow more distinct for her. Endomorph build requires attention here—keep core engaged so your weight does not sag forward. The key is stamina pacing: short sets of thirty to sixty seconds, then reset and breathe before re-entry. She will likely respond with a softening pelvis, a continuous press-in with her hips, or a stilling of the body as she surrenders to the repetition. These are your signals that Flow has taken hold.
If she begins to drift or her cues flatten, consider slight modulation—Lightening pressure for a few reps, or adding a touch of angling to the Rocking line. Think of it like adjusting a dial rather than changing the channel. Flow lives in small corrections, not big swings. Journal your observations in one clear line, such as, “Right wall, shallow, Medium pressure, hips kept pressing in at cycle three.”
The discipline now is to resist exploring every wall. Flow is monogamous—pick one wall, one pressure band, one depth zone, and stay faithful until her body confirms it’s working. This is what trains her nervous system to entrain to your rhythm and what builds your endurance without scattering energy.
Ready to proceed to Module 6 for The Harrare, expanding Flow into the mid and deep zones where safe?


=========================================================================================




Module 6 of the Harrare is about carefully opening the Flow you established into the mid and deep zones while keeping every safeguard in place. This expansion is not about chasing depth for its own sake but about adding a new dimension of stimulation when her cues show she is ready. You must carry forward the same discipline you learned in Module 5, while layering in precise depth control, cervix safety, and clear breath-driven pacing.
Begin again in neutral forearm-plank, spine long, shoulders anchored, and hips steady. Inhale at baseline, exhale as you enter with your usual shallow 80%. Let her body show its readiness—if she is already curling her pelvis up, pressing in with steady hips, or giving you deeper exhalations, you may begin to gate into the mid 10%. With a penis below 5 inches, this means pressing in with clear Medium pressure, not Hard, because your leverage allows her canal to cup and surround you fully at this depth. As an endomorph, your key here is to protect your stamina and joints—move from your hips and core rather than sinking weight into your wrists or shoulders.
When stepping into the mid zone, use Rocking as your dominant quality with only slight Angling adjustments. The compass target remains whichever wall you established in Flow—north wall, right wall, or diagonal. This keeps consistency for her nervous system while adding intensity through depth. Inhale to reset, exhale to carry into mid depth, then inhale to retreat back to shallow. Cycle in short sets of three to five, then pause at shallow to let her body catch the rhythm again. She may signal acceptance with a fuller pelvic lift, a sudden stillness, or even a soft involuntary sound. Journal this simply, for example: “North wall, mid depth, Medium pressure, hips curled at rep two.”
If her body continues to open, and lubrication is steady, you can test deep 10%. With below 5 inches, this is often more about angle and firmness than raw depth. Aim the glans toward her north wall or diagonal at the deepest zone, never straight into the cervix. Pressure should be Medium-Light, with a full exhale through entry and a slower inhale retreat. Keep sets very short—one or two deep strokes between longer shallow or mid runs. Imagine it like diving into a pool: you touch the depth, then immediately rise back up.
What she will feel here is a new fullness, a sharper press into the sensitive roof or diagonal, and a deepening of her pelvic response. If she tightens, flinches, or exhales sharply as if bracing, immediately retreat to shallow 80% and rebuild Flow. The SSP loop guides you here: Observe the cue, Tweak depth or pressure, Test with one or two strokes, then retreat. Never force. Flow must always be preserved, even at depth.
For endomorph training, the limit is stamina—do not stay in mid or deep for more than thirty seconds at a time before retreating to shallow. Keep joints safe by resetting often in forearm-plank and letting the spine stay long. For below 5 inches, depth clarity is your strength—use precise angles and pressure bands rather than brute force. Your ceiling should always be Medium pressure at mid and Medium-Light at deep.
Flow Deep is about trust. When done correctly, her cues will tell you she feels safe and wide open. That is your green light. When cues fade, you return to shallow. Journal after every session in plain shorthand. One example might be: “Diagonal north, mid depth, Medium pressure, stillness at rep four, retreated at rep six.” This makes every deep test a data point for your future refinement.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for The Harrare with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches?


=========================================================================================


Module 7 of the Harrare is where you begin using Pinning to spark her body into multiple orgasms by carefully shifting angles, pressures, and tempo in short, controlled bursts. The goal is not to overwhelm her but to lock into her orgasmic state and then re-ignite it by altering just one variable at a time. You keep everything tight, contained, and deliberate, with constant returns to baseline to protect your stamina and her comfort.
Start from forearm-plank, spine long, shoulders anchored, hips steady. Inhale at neutral, then exhale into your shallow 80% entry where Flow feels most reliable. Once you feel her orgasmic pulse or hear her breath break into shorter waves, you shift into Pinning. This means holding pressure against one wall—north, right, left, or diagonal—and making micro-changes in Rocking or Angling while keeping your depth steady. For example, you may keep her north wall in contact with your glans at shallow depth and switch from Medium to Light pressure across two or three strokes. Her likely cue is a stilling of her hips or a sudden pelvic curl that seems to pull you deeper.
Pinning works because her body is primed, and your slight adjustments feel magnified. For an endomorph with a penis below 5 inches, the key is to maintain clarity of contact rather than chase depth. Keep sets very short—five to seven strokes at one variation—then retreat to shallow baseline and reset. This protects your joints and stamina while giving her nervous system time to recover before the next spark. Journal a shorthand example: “Right wall, shallow, Light-Medium pressure shift, pelvic curl at rep three.”
When she peaks, do not drive forward with force. Instead, exhale fully, soften your hips, and hold steady pressure at the wall she responds to. Think of it like holding a guitar string at tension—the vibration will come through her body as long as you stay anchored. Only after her release fades do you test a new variation. SSP guides you here: Observe the cue, Tweak one variable, Test for two to three strokes, then reset. If she resists, tightens, or pushes away, retreat to shallow and rebuild Flow before trying again.
For your body type, remember joint safety: keep shoulders stacked, wrists aligned, and do not let your hips sag. For stamina, give yourself ten to fifteen seconds of shallow Flow between Pinning sets. With below 5 inches, your advantage is precision—use clear Rocking or Angling rather than depth to keep her canal engaged. Pressure ceilings remain at Medium for Pinning, because the goal is to tease nerves rather than overload them.
Pinning is where control and restraint create more than force ever could. When done right, she will feel waves stacking, each release pulling her into the next. You will know by her hips pressing in, her body going still as if she cannot move, or her breath dropping into deep, heavy exhales. In those moments, you are not chasing another stroke—you are holding her in a rhythm she cannot escape.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for The Harrare with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches?


=========================================================================================




Module 8 for the Harrare is where you turn everything you have trained into a clear practice plan that you can follow week by week. The focus is on consistency, building endurance, and sharpening precision, while protecting your joints and managing depth safely for an endomorph with a penis below 5 inches. Think of it as laying down tracks so your nervous system and body can run the same pathways until they feel natural and effortless.
Begin by setting a foundation with orientation drills. Each session opens in forearm plank, shoulders stacked and hips level, inhaling at baseline and exhaling into shallow 80% placement. Spend the first minutes reacquainting yourself with baseline and the feel of clear wall contact. Your early weeks should devote more time to shallow orientation, because that’s where clarity and stamina build fastest. Flow should only begin once your baseline is crisp and repeatable.
The second phase of practice focuses on isolated keystrokes. Work one keystroke at a time for a handful of cycles, keeping the breath pattern steady—inhaling on reset, exhaling through action. For endomorph leverage, maintain tight core engagement so hips don’t sag, and allow longer rests between sets to protect stamina. With below 5 inches, your advantage is precision; stay at shallow or mid range and reinforce how clearly the head contacts each wall. Do not chase depth—clarity will create stronger nerve feedback for her. Journal after sets with one short line like: “North wall, shallow, Medium pressure, pelvic curl at rep six.”
In the third phase, begin chaining keystrokes into rhythm. Choose two keystrokes you can hold steady and alternate them in sequence, always resetting to neutral after each mini-chain. Use Flow sets of ten to twelve strokes, then pause for a breath reset. Partner cues matter here: you are looking for steady deepening of her breath or hips pressing back toward you. If cues fade, retreat to shallow orientation and rebuild clarity before pressing forward.
In the later weeks, test Flow with Pinning integration. When she shows orgasmic cues, run short bursts of five strokes with subtle Rocking or Angling adjustments. Always protect joint load by keeping hips supported by core engagement, and always return to shallow resets between sets. This gives your body stamina recovery and allows her body to reset before another spark. The SSP loop keeps you disciplined: observe, adjust one factor, test, and reset.
Across four weeks, your sessions should gradually extend from shorter orientation-heavy work into longer Flow practice with controlled bursts of Pinning. By the final week, aim for twenty to thirty minutes of work with several reflection pauses where you journal and reset. Stamina pacing for an endomorph means resting after every major set and keeping hydration in check. For depth safety with below 5 inches, cap most work at shallow and mid 10%, only brushing deeper zones when cues and lubrication allow, never with force.
This training plan sets you on a path where the Harrare becomes second nature. Your body learns the keystrokes as muscle memory, your breath anchors hold your rhythm, and your attention to cues keeps her body open and ready for more. Precision and clarity will always serve you better than chasing force.
