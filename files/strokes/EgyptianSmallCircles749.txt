Module 1 of the Egyptian Small Circles introduces posture, alignment, and body setup—the foundation that makes every later movement smooth, safe, and precise. Begin in the forearm-plank position with your knees lightly on the canvas, spine long and chest open. The elbows rest directly under the shoulders, and the hands are relaxed but firm against the mat. Your hips stay a few inches above hers, giving the pelvis space to rotate without compressing your lower back. Take a slow inhale, letting your ribs expand, then exhale fully, allowing your weight to settle through the forearms and core. This is your neutral baseline, the home position you will always return to between keystrokes. For an Ectomorph frame, the goal is balance and fluid control rather than force. Keep your body light, almost suspended, and let your breath become the engine for movement.
From this baseline, the first practice is simply learning to hold the frame while maintaining a steady rhythm of breath. Inhale to lift the hips slightly, exhale to lower them to baseline again, feeling how your core stabilizes the spine and prevents sagging. This micro-rock establishes your connection to the floor and her body beneath you. You’re learning to feel pressure gradients, not to drive depth. The penis stays shallow, no more than 80% entry, the head angled slightly down toward the south line. This shallow zone gives clarity of wall contact without strain, especially for a 5–7 inch length. She should feel gentle presence, not impact—just a warm, gliding connection that syncs with her breath.
Postural precision protects your joints and defines wall clarity. Your shoulders must stay relaxed; avoid collapsing through your chest. For Ectomorphs, wrist and elbow health depend on stacking joints and using the forearm line to distribute weight. Keep your hips directly over her pelvis, not drifting forward. When you inhale, think of drawing the belly in and widening the ribs. When you exhale, let that breath move through your hips as if you’re pouring energy downward. This coupling of breath and pelvic tilt becomes the invisible engine of the stroke. The metaphor here is steering a slow canoe—you don’t push hard; you guide the flow with small, deliberate adjustments.
Each time you return to neutral, take a pause to feel what changed. If her breath deepens or her hips press lightly upward, it means your baseline feels safe and clear. If she tenses, exhales sharply, or shifts her legs away, adjust your hip angle by a few degrees and recheck your alignment. The goal of this module is awareness: knowing how to maintain structure, clarity, and comfort so that when motion begins, your body already knows how to protect itself and read hers. Keep the spine long, chin slightly tucked, and neck relaxed. This preserves the energy loop from breath through hips to floor.
During training, stay in shallow 80% for all drills. Pressure remains Light to Medium. Never hold your breath; the exhale must lead every descent. Because the Ectomorph body is naturally efficient but sometimes unstable under sustained load, schedule rest windows every ten cycles. Drop to your knees, shake out the shoulders, breathe deeply, then resume. Each reset teaches you how to sustain stamina without rigidity. You’re not muscling the stroke—you’re learning precision under softness.
A sample journal note might read: “Neutral plank stable, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, hips aligned, her breath deepened at rep six.” That one line captures your feedback loop for today.
Once you can hold baseline alignment, regulate breath, and maintain shallow contact without tension, you’re ready to start learning the keystrokes themselves.

===================================================================================
Module 2 of the Egyptian Small Circles teaches the keystrokes that form the foundation of the stroke’s circular motion. Each keystroke isolates a different diagonal of the canal, teaching your hips to blend Rocking and Angling in perfect proportion. The two key components are the left-lean to right-wall glide and the right-lean to left-wall glide. Both require patience and precision, not force. You will learn how each diagonal behaves under your body type—Ectomorph—and how to maintain clarity of contact with a 5–7 inch shaft length that favors mid-range rotation over deep thrust.
Start again in neutral forearm-plank, knees light on the mat, hips hovering above her pelvis. On an exhale, let the hips lean slightly left. The head of your penis will naturally point right, sliding along her right wall at shallow 80% depth. This motion combines Angling and Rocking—the angle shifts laterally while the base rocks forward through your lower spine. Keep your core steady so the movement originates from the pelvis, not the shoulders or knees. Apply Light to Medium pressure, maintaining smooth breath: inhale to center, exhale through the glide. This is your right-wall glide keystroke. It builds sensitivity along the right diagonal leading to the south wall, the zone that often produces her first rhythmic contractions. Watch for cues: her hips tilting right, a deepening exhale, or a subtle pelvic curl. These mean alignment is correct. If she tenses or exhales sharply, reduce angle and pressure, staying at the shallow limit until her body invites more.
Return to center on a full inhale and hold still for one breath. On the next exhale, lean hips slightly right. The head of your penis now points left, tracing the left diagonal of her canal at the same shallow 80% zone. Pressure remains Light to Medium. This left-wall glide mirrors the first keystroke and creates the opposite arc of the circle. For an Ectomorph, focus on pelvic rotation rather than side-to-side translation; your lighter frame allows cleaner articulation without compressing her pelvis. The goal is smoothness—think of your hips as a compass drawing a curved line from north to south with each exhale. This motion creates balanced stimulation on both walls, preparing the body to receive the full circular rhythm later.
Both keystrokes serve different rhythm phases. The right-wall glide is ideal for Tracking, helping you feel the internal contours and calibrate angle. The left-wall glide is ideal for Flow, sustaining a continuous pattern once precision is locked. Together they form the complete circle—one diagonal leading seamlessly into the next. Keep the breath anchored to each glide: inhale at centerline, exhale through the motion. She should feel warmth spreading from her lower canal downward, not pressure pushing inward. The glans paints a crescent, not a line, which maintains stimulation without irritation.
For a 5–7 inch shaft, depth gating is crucial. Stay in shallow 80% for the first five cycles, then test a gradual shift into mid 10% only if her body opens through breath or pelvic curl. The Ectomorph build favors control over mass; use that advantage to keep transitions light and fluid. Avoid driving from the knees, which adds excess force. Instead, pivot from the pelvis while keeping the chest quiet and forearms firm. The most important cue is the rebound of her breath—if her inhale grows longer as you glide, the motion is correct; if it shortens or catches, reduce pressure immediately.
Once both diagonals feel distinct, begin alternating them every other breath: exhale left, inhale center, exhale right, inhale center. This is your first experience of the Egyptian orbit. Feel how Rocking blends into Angling as the pelvis draws an invisible figure eight. She’ll begin to mirror your breath naturally, her body relaxing into the rhythm. Maintain awareness of her hips pressing upward or stilling—both signal rising arousal. If her hips freeze but breath deepens, stay shallow and slow; if she begins to press against you, allow a touch more depth but never exceed Medium pressure.
A sample journal tag might read: “Right-wall glide, shallow 80%, Light pressure, hips curled at rep four; left-wall glide steady, Medium pressure, deeper breath at rep seven.” This captures both calibration and feedback for future refinement.
Once you can perform both keystrokes with clear wall contact and consistent breath for at least ten cycles, you’re ready to link them into one continuous circle and learn how to chain them into full stroke rhythm.

===================================================================================
Module 3 of the Egyptian Small Circles teaches how to link the keystrokes into one continuous rhythm that feels smooth, circular, and deeply synchronized with breath. You are now chaining the left-lean and right-lean glides into a single orbit, learning how to maintain control while the hips flow uninterrupted. The purpose here is not speed but continuity—keeping the circle alive without breaking baseline alignment. Begin in your forearm-plank with the same steady frame, hips floating above her pelvis, spine long, shoulders relaxed. Inhale deeply, feel your ribs expand, and on the exhale, start the left-lean motion toward her right wall.
As you complete the glide across the right wall, allow the pelvis to pass through centerline on the next inhale, then smoothly shift into the right-lean glide toward her left wall on the following exhale. The transition between these two movements is the core of the stroke. The pelvis never fully stops—it slows through the center like a pendulum reversing direction, staying in the shallow 80% depth zone. This alternation creates a gentle, hypnotic spiral of contact. The head of the penis paints an infinity shape—each side of the canal receiving equal stimulation without abrupt direction changes. Maintain Light to Medium pressure and keep the rhythm bound to your breath: exhale during the wall glide, inhale through the center pass.
For an Ectomorph body type, this chaining sequence requires stability rather than power. Your frame should stay light and buoyant, with most of the energy coming from the lower abdominals. Because of your natural leanness, your hips can rotate more freely, but this also means your lower back and wrists must be protected. Keep your core active and resist collapsing through your spine. The 5–7 inch length gives you ideal range for circular strokes—long enough to sweep the inner walls clearly, short enough to prevent joint compression. The challenge is keeping each half-rotation identical so the circle doesn’t wobble or distort.
You will feel how the motion alternates between Rocking and Angling. The moment you lean left, the pelvis angles and the spine rocks forward. When you pass through center, both forces equalize, then reverse on the other diagonal. The internal sensation is a constant, orbiting glide rather than a thrust. She feels this as swirling stimulation across her lower canal, like warm water circling around her. If her hips press upward or she exhales deeply through her mouth, it means the orbit is aligned with her inner rhythm. Keep following her cues as you breathe together. If she tightens, shorten the arc and lighten the pressure until her body softens again.
Every few cycles, return to the neutral baseline to rest your core. Inhale fully at center, hold the plank for two seconds, then exhale and reset your hips before starting the next orbit. These resets teach your nervous system to re-stabilize quickly, keeping your rhythm sustainable. For the Ectomorph, stamina comes from precision, not strength. Maintain steady breathing and pace—roughly one full circular cycle every four seconds. Avoid rushing; the slower you move, the more distinct each wall feels.
Reflection after each session matters as much as execution. She will tell you everything through her breath and hips. A deeper sigh, a stilling pelvis, or her hands resting at your ribs are signs she’s entering Flow. That’s the state you’re training for—the merging of movement, pressure, and breath. When you both lose track of where one motion ends and the other begins, the circle has been achieved.
A journal example might read: “Full orbit sustained at shallow 80%, Medium pressure, rhythm steady, hips aligned, her exhale synced by rep nine.”
Once you can maintain that continuous motion for ten to twelve cycles without losing alignment or breath timing, you are ready to move into the Tracking phase—learning how to test, refine, and read her body’s responses in real time.
Ready to proceed to Module 4 for Egyptian Small Circles with Body Type Ectomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


===================================================================================
Module 4 of the Egyptian Small Circles moves you into the Tracking phase—where precision replaces assumption and your body learns to read hers like a feedback instrument. You are no longer just performing a motion; you are measuring, refining, and re-patterning based on what she communicates through breath, pressure, and stillness. Tracking is performed in the shallow 80% depth zone only. It’s the testing ground where you gather data for Flow.
Begin in your neutral forearm-plank baseline with your hips aligned over hers, spine long, elbows grounded, and breath steady. Your goal is to form micro-hypotheses for how each diagonal of the canal responds to slight adjustments in pressure and angle. Inhale to stabilize, exhale into a left-lean right-wall glide using Light pressure. Observe how her body responds. If her breath deepens or her hips subtly curl inward, the contact is aligned. If her breath pauses or she stiffens, note it mentally and reduce pressure on the next pass. The Tracking loop follows the SSP pattern: Define the angle, Hypothesize how it should feel, Track her reaction, and Refine on the next cycle. Repeat this loop every three to four orbits. The adjustments are small but clear—no movements smaller than a finger’s width.
Your body type, Ectomorph, naturally excels at sensing light shifts in resistance and texture. Use that sensitivity to your advantage. Keep your joints unlocked and let the pelvis float rather than drive. Each orbit through the right or left wall is a new opportunity to test a hypothesis. For instance, you might notice that Medium pressure on the right diagonal produces a deeper exhale from her, while the same pressure on the left diagonal makes her hips withdraw. That tells you her right wall prefers firmer stimulation while her left prefers softer, more angled contact. You adjust accordingly, shaping your stroke to her body rather than imposing rhythm by force.
Keep each test run contained to four full circular cycles before re-centering. On your inhale, stabilize at neutral. On your exhale, shift into the next variation. The breath provides timing anchors for your internal tracking: inhale equals observe; exhale equals act. Watch her cues closely. A deeper breath means “stay there.” A pelvic curl means “more of that angle.” A sudden stillness signals “pause, she’s processing.” If you sense her hips rise gently toward you, that’s your invitation to continue or increase depth slightly. For your 5–7 inch length, entering mid 10% is acceptable only during these clear invitations. Never chase depth—wait for it.
The internal effect of this module is heightened proprioception. You start to feel the canal as a living, responsive field rather than a passive surface. The more you refine, the more obvious her cues become. The Ectomorph advantage here is finesse—your lighter structure lets you read and react without overwhelming her. Protect your lower back by maintaining gentle abdominal tone at all times, especially when pivoting between diagonals. Shoulders remain quiet; energy flows from breath through pelvis, not upper body.
After each set of experiments, pause at baseline and breathe together for two full cycles. Feel her body settling beneath yours. You’re building trust through consistency, not intensity. When she exhales deeply and her pelvis softens under you, it means the Tracking has succeeded—her body now trusts your accuracy. The foundation for Flow is complete.
A journal entry for this module might read: “Right wall shallow 80%, Medium pressure evoked curl at rep three; left wall Light pressure, deeper breath at rep six; return to neutral steady.” This one line records your hypothesis and result clearly enough to guide your next session.
Once you can run these micro-tests seamlessly, sense her responses without hesitation, and keep your breath unbroken, you’re ready to enter Flow—where testing gives way to surrender and the circle becomes continuous motion sustained by shared rhythm.
Ready to proceed to Module 5 for Egyptian Small Circles with Body Type Ectomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


===================================================================================
Module 5 of the Egyptian Small Circles takes you into the Flow phase, where precision becomes rhythm and rhythm becomes connection. You are no longer dissecting the motion—you are sustaining it. Every breath, every glide, and every exhale now serves to maintain one continuous orbit around her internal compass. The focus is shallow-to-mid range, primarily the 80% depth zone, with optional entry into mid 10% only when her body clearly invites it through breath and movement.
Begin in your forearm-plank, baseline aligned. Inhale fully through the nose, expanding your ribs and spine. On the exhale, initiate the left-lean to right-wall glide using the same relaxed pelvic rotation from Tracking. Without pause, transition through center on the inhale, then exhale into the right-lean to left-wall glide. The rhythm now becomes circular, fluid, and unbroken—one orbit per breath cycle. For an Ectomorph, this should feel effortless, not heavy. Keep your core toned but supple, using your breath as the metronome that drives each pass. Every exhale propels motion; every inhale centers it.
The pressure remains Light to Medium, favoring precision over depth. Flow is not about power—it’s about sustaining clarity. You should feel her internal walls responding like the curved interior of a bowl—each glide tracing its edge, never colliding with its base. Stay within the shallow 80% unless her hips begin to rise and pull you slightly deeper, which signals her body is ready for a brief foray into mid 10%. The circular path should feel smooth, continuous, and unforced. The head of your penis should always be describing a soft diagonal arc between the north-south and east-west compass points. Avoid pushing straight down or thrusting forward; both break the circle and disrupt her body’s absorption of rhythm.
As Flow develops, your attention shifts from mechanics to resonance. She’ll tell you where you are through her breath and body. A long, open-mouthed exhale means you’ve hit resonance. A pause in her breathing means she’s reorganizing internally—slow your orbit slightly and stay in that diagonal. A steady pelvic curl means she’s absorbing your pressure into her pelvic floor; maintain the same angle and pace. This is where Flow becomes trance. Your body moves on autopilot, her body mirrors your rhythm, and both nervous systems begin to entrain.
Your Ectomorph build offers agility here. Because you’re naturally lighter, you can sustain long Flow sessions without joint fatigue. Keep your elbows under your shoulders, your spine long, and your hips floating rather than sinking. The 5–7 inch length lets you maintain constant wall contact without bottoming out. You’ll find that small hip spirals are more effective than wide circles; they keep her stimulation concentrated where her nerves are most responsive. Think of your pelvis as drawing a coin-sized circle inside her—not a dinner plate. That containment keeps sensation sharp and controlled.
Every ten cycles, take a micro-reset at centerline. Inhale, hold your plank, then exhale and continue. These pauses refresh your stability and keep your awareness sharp. She will likely deepen her breathing in sync with you during these moments, using them to ground herself. When she exhales in sync, it’s confirmation you’re both in Flow.
A journal example for this phase might read: “Full orbit sustained, shallow-to-mid range, Medium pressure, steady rhythm, hips matched by rep twelve, shared breath lock at rep fifteen.” This single line captures that the rhythm was held and resonance achieved.
Flow is where endurance and sensitivity merge. The longer you sustain it, the more her body begins to generate involuntary responses—twitches, small curls, and heat spreading through the canal. You’re not chasing orgasm here; you’re stabilizing rhythm under natural arousal. The circle becomes the pulse of her body. Once you can maintain this steady orbit for fifteen to twenty cycles without drift or fatigue, you’re ready to enter the Deep Flow Option—learning how to cautiously explore the mid and deep zones without breaking the circle or her comfort.
Ready to proceed to Module 6 for Egyptian Small Circles with Body Type Ectomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


===================================================================================
Module 6 of Egyptian Small Circles teaches you how to safely enter the deep zone without losing rhythm or precision. You’ve built control in the shallow and mid ranges—now you’re learning how to stretch the circle into her depth without collapsing it. The goal is not deeper thrusting. It’s steadier descent. You are expanding sensation while protecting sensitivity.
Start as always in the neutral forearm-plank. Spine long. Elbows under shoulders. Inhale slowly through your nose and feel the air expand your ribs; exhale softly through your mouth to relax your hips into alignment. This breath keeps you from collapsing into your joints. For an Ectomorph, the danger is dropping too low too soon and losing leverage. Keep your pelvis floating, not hanging. Your 5–7 inch length means you already contact her deep wall easily—depth is never the goal. Depth is pressure clarity.
Begin with your standard shallow orbit from Module 5. Inhale as you trace the top arc; exhale as you let the pelvis glide one inch deeper. It’s not a drive, it’s a melt. You are letting gravity lengthen the orbit. Think of it like sliding a warm coin deeper into honey—the motion stays circular, not linear. The circular glide presses her internal walls diagonally, never straight down. You should feel a soft resistance at the back of the canal. That’s the cue to hold pressure steady and sustain breath instead of pushing farther.
Stay here for three full breath cycles. Each exhale maintains gentle Medium pressure at that new depth. Each inhale lifts you back toward the shallow 80% zone before dropping again. This wave pattern conditions your body to modulate depth automatically. Watch her cues closely. If she exhales fully or arches toward you, her body is accepting the circle. If she goes still or tightens, you’ve reached her safety edge. Return immediately to shallow orbit and reset your breath. Deep work is guided entirely by her relaxation, not your desire to go further.
After several minutes, begin blending shallow and mid arcs into one continuous flow. Inhale to rise toward the top of the circle; exhale to glide diagonally down into mid 10%. When her hips start to meet you halfway—small curls upward, thighs drawing in—you can allow a brief visit into the deep 10%. Enter only on a long exhale, staying at that depth for one slow count before rising back up on the inhale. The deeper you go, the smaller your circles become. The head of your penis should feel like it’s tracing the inner rim of a bowl, never striking its base.
For an Ectomorph, stamina comes from rhythm, not strength. Keep your elbows and core firm but not rigid. Your light frame lets you maintain motion without strain, but your lower back can fatigue if you let it arch. Protect it by keeping your hips engaged from the abdomen instead of from the glutes. Reset every twelve orbits: inhale, pause at center, exhale, and resume. Each reset recenters your balance and lets her body catch up to yours.
You’ll notice the canal feels different now—heat concentrated at the back, contractions timed with your rotations. That’s your sign you’re holding depth safely. Don’t chase speed; let the circular path stay slow and deliberate. The deepest pleasure comes from sustained glide, not force. She may start pulsing or curling tighter around you. That’s her body syncing to your orbit. Stay within that range and let the rhythm hum.
End the set by returning to shallow flow. One full minute of slow orbiting at 80% depth helps release the tension built during deeper work. Think of it as sealing the edges of the circle—soft, even pressure that tells her body it’s safe again. A simple journal line after this session could read: “Deep circle sustained, Medium pressure, hips responsive, return to shallow restored balance.”
You’ve learned how to carry precision into depth without losing sensitivity. The next step is to use that depth rhythm to ignite the reflex loop—where her contractions guide your movements instead of the other way around.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for Egyptian Small Circles with Body Type Ectomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


===================================================================================
Module 7 of Egyptian Small Circles teaches you how to turn her involuntary contractions into rhythm cues. This is reflex looping—the moment her body begins to move you. Everything until now trained your control; this trains your surrender. You will still lead the orbit, but her pulses now dictate micro-adjustments of angle, pressure, and timing. When you can ride those reflexes without breaking the circle, you enter the state of shared rhythm.
Start in the same forearm-plank baseline, spine long, weight balanced between elbows and knees. Take two deep breaths to settle. Begin shallow, tracing the standard top-circle with Light pressure on the exhale. Keep your awareness on her walls instead of your motion. Within the first minute, you’ll feel small, spontaneous grips or contractions. Each is a signal—your task is to match it, not override it. When she tightens, pause rotation for half a second, sustain pressure, then continue the orbit as she releases. This micro-delay converts her reflex into fuel.
As the rhythm continues, you’ll sense patterns in those grips—usually at the same phase of each orbit, often when you hit the inner right or back-left wall. Once you detect a pattern, exhale through that phase and lift slightly on inhale. That turns the contraction into a natural timing cue. Her body now acts like a metronome. The Ectomorph advantage here is sensitivity; your lighter frame makes you feel those contractions clearly without needing heavy pressure. Keep your depth around the shallow-to-mid 10% range for endurance.
Stay relaxed in the shoulders and jaw. The smaller the circle, the smoother the transmission of feedback. Imagine a smooth wheel rolling along a curved surface—steady, frictionless, no jerks. When you sense a contraction building, tighten your core gently, not your hips. Let the abdomen absorb the pulse, then release back into orbit. If you meet sudden resistance, return instantly to neutral for one breath, then resume with lighter touch. Her stillness is as informative as her motion.
After five to seven minutes, a synchronization appears: her breath deepens right before each contraction. That’s the cue to exhale with her, letting your pelvis and breath merge. This is reflex entrainment. Each time she exhales, your orbit descends and completes its loop; each time she inhales, you rise slightly and reset. The two of you are now one mechanical rhythm. She will often moan or tremble as this synchronization locks in. You must not speed up. Keep the orbit slow, circular, constant.
When she begins to pulse repeatedly—those small involuntary grips arriving one after another—you enter the pinning phase. Stay mid-depth, maintain Medium pressure, and shrink the orbit to half its size. The movement now feels like tracing the rim of a coin rather than a plate. Each contraction she gives presses you inward; you counter by widening your circle slightly on the exhale. This push-pull maintains blood flow and prevents overstimulation. Journal afterward: “Reflex loop achieved at 12 minutes, orbit steady, contractions synchronized at right-wall pulse.”
For a 5–7 inch length, avoid chasing deeper contractions. The most productive reflexes live in the mid-zone, where her walls can flex and rebound fully. Too deep and you’ll bypass them; too shallow and you’ll miss their grip. Stay where you feel the pull strongest and let her set the tempo.
By the end of this session, you should feel your pelvis moving without conscious thought, guided entirely by her reflexes. This is the sign of integration: two nervous systems sharing one pattern. When you can maintain this loop for several minutes, you’re ready to move toward the final module—building a full training plan that cements endurance, reflection, and progressive mastery.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for Egyptian Small Circles with Body Type Ectomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


===================================================================================
Module 8 of Egyptian Small Circles transforms everything you’ve learned into a four-week training flow. This is where control, depth, reflex, and rhythm become habit. You are no longer memorizing movement—you are cultivating precision, stamina, and sensory awareness until they merge into instinct.
Begin every session the same way: forearm-plank baseline, deep breath, and two minutes of quiet hovering. This is your nervous system reset. Inhale through your nose until your ribs expand; exhale slowly through your mouth until your hips release and your spine feels long. This stillness calibrates the compass and lets your body remember neutral. Ectomorphs must guard against joint fatigue, so stack shoulders over elbows and keep the pelvis light. Each session starts shallow, Light pressure, using slow circles until your blood warms and rhythm feels effortless.
In the first week, train only the shallow orbit. Stay in the 80% zone and focus on clarity of wall contact. Each orbit is one breath: inhale to lift, exhale to glide. After about twenty cycles, stop, breathe, and journal a one-line record such as “South-East shallow glide, Medium pressure, hips aligned, breath matched at rep twelve.” These lines teach your body through reflection, not memory. The goal is repeatable smoothness—each circle matching the last.
In the second week, layer in mid-zone work. Alternate shallow and mid orbits for sets of five breaths each. This teaches your muscles to shift depth automatically without losing compass orientation. Pay attention to what she would feel—gradual fullness that never breaks flow. The 5–7 inch length allows full mid penetration without risk of bottoming out. When her imaginary body would begin to pulse or her breath would deepen, treat that as your checkpoint to rest, not to chase. Your light frame means endurance comes from tempo control, not force.
By the third week, blend shallow, mid, and brief deep arcs into seamless loops. Keep depth at or below 90% of your maximum gate. Deep work should appear only for a single exhale, then lift back to mid. These transitions refine timing and pelvic coordination. Your journal entries here might read: “Down-Right diagonal, Medium pressure, smooth rise after contraction.” That shorthand captures both motion and awareness.
The final week is endurance and reflex. Practice for ten to twelve minutes without pausing, cycling between light and medium pressure while watching for fatigue in wrists or hips. Ectomorphs need rest hygiene—after every sixty seconds of orbiting, lift to neutral and breathe for two counts. This pause resets alignment and prevents overuse. End each session by returning to shallow orbit for one minute, sealing the pattern and calming your nervous system.
At the end of four weeks, you should be able to maintain smooth, circular motion with stable pressure and effortless depth modulation. Your awareness of wall feedback, breath cues, and partner reflexes will have sharpened into instinct. Keep journaling after every session—one line is enough to anchor progress. When the circle feels like it moves itself, you’ve mastered its rhythm.
