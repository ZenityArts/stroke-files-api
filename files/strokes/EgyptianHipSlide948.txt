Module 1 for the Egyptian Hip Slide teaches the body how to find and hold the right position before any motion begins. The goal is to build a clean, neutral baseline that protects the joints, locks the spine into one plane, and lets every keystroke land with accuracy later. Start on your knees in a forearm plank with your elbows directly under your shoulders and your chest angled slightly forward. Your pelvis should hang neutral, not tucked or arched. The weight runs evenly through both forearms and the tops of your feet. From here, the spine becomes your central beam. Keep it straight and alive, like a stretched bowstring—no sagging, no tension. Inhale through the nose, letting the air fill low into the belly, then exhale through the mouth to settle your ribs down. That breath locks you into neutral. Every move of the Egyptian Hip Slide will grow from this posture, so take time to feel it become automatic.
From this plank, notice where your hips naturally hang. For a Mesomorph, this frame is solid, broad, and muscular. The goal is to use that leverage without collapsing the lower back. Keep your core firm but not clenched; imagine the abdomen like a quiet drum, responsive but steady. Because your penis length is below five inches, depth control is critical. Your range of motion should emphasize broad Rocking and lateral Angling rather than deep drives. You will work mostly in the shallow 80% and mid 10% depth zones. Hard thrusting will lose precision and reduce her wall contact. Instead, the Egyptian Hip Slide will reward finesse—short arcs, steady hips, and angled pressure that rides along the wall, not into it.
To learn the feeling of neutral balance, shift your hips half an inch forward and back while keeping the forearms fixed. This is your first taste of Rocking. It is not penetration yet, just awareness. Feel how the core tightens on the backward draw and how exhaling through the forward press stabilizes the pelvis. Next, test a micro-angle by letting one hip drop just slightly toward the mat while the other lifts. This begins Angling. Keep the pressure even on both forearms so the spine stays centered. Alternate left and right while staying shallow. The movement should feel like a slow sway through water—controlled, quiet, and weightless. If your shoulders start to burn, pause and breathe three cycles, letting the wrists stay soft and the elbows steady beneath you.
Each inhale prepares the frame; each exhale stabilizes the load. The Egyptian Hip Slide depends on this breath rhythm to guide timing. You will inhale before the lean and exhale through the lift or drop of each hip, syncing pressure to breath so that the movement feels like one wave instead of two separate pushes. A Mesomorph body can over-muscle this action, so resist the urge to drive power through the glutes. Use the forearms and abs as your control points. Think of your hips as a low pendulum swinging through gravity’s centerline, not a piston trying to pound. The effect inside her body will be smoother wall gliding, not poking.
Her cues will show you when your base alignment is working. She will breathe deeper, her hips will subtly press upward, or her exhale will slow. Those are your green lights that contact is consistent and non-threatening. If she stiffens, arches too soon, or breathes shallowly, that means the angle or depth is off. Pull back to the 80% zone, adjust the tilt of your pelvis slightly toward the side you just over-pressed, and find your breath again before continuing. The goal is not to chase sensation but to maintain precision.
For journaling, write one simple line after your practice: “Centerline, shallow depth, Medium pressure, even breath, hips stable at rep six.” This shorthand trains awareness of when you lose alignment or overexert. Across sessions, this small reflection builds your instinct for how your body geometry interacts with hers.
The essential metaphor for this module is the bow and arrow. Your plank is the bow—steady, curved with tension held but not released. The hips are the arrow drawn back slowly, aligned, waiting for direction. Every stroke that follows will depend on how true this aim feels before motion begins.

=======================================================================================================
Module 2 for the Egyptian Hip Slide breaks the stroke into its keystroke building blocks so you can feel how each piece behaves before they merge into rhythm. From the forearm-plank baseline you built in Module 1, the first keystroke is the Left Lean. It starts with a slow exhale as you let your left hip glide slightly toward the mat, which angles your shaft to press the right vaginal wall. This motion combines Angling and a small degree of Rocking because your pelvis subtly dips as it moves laterally. Keep it within the shallow 80% zone so the head of the penis brushes and broadens pressure rather than digging. For a Mesomorph frame, stay conscious of not overloading the left shoulder or compressing the lower spine; the leverage of your build will magnify small tilts. Your Medium pressure should feel like a firm caress, not a shove, and your breath should stabilize the tempo—inhale to prepare, exhale through the lean. She will likely respond with a soft pull of her hips or a quiet sigh if the right wall stimulation lands correctly. If she exhales too sharply or shifts away, you’ve pressed too deep or too fast—draw back to center and re-anchor your breath before continuing.
The second keystroke is the Left Vertical Lift. From the bottom of the lean, engage your core and raise the hips vertically a few inches, still leaning left. This lifts the head of your penis slightly upward along the right wall, expanding friction across a broader band of tissue. This is primarily Rocking, but the held lean keeps it inside an Angled path. The depth stays in the shallow-to-mid range, about the 80% to 10% transition, since your shorter length benefits from maximizing surface glide instead of point pressure. The exhale carries the lift; inhale as you settle back down. The right wall should feel like a warm slide, not a jab. For a Mesomorph, keep the ribs soft and the neck relaxed so your power stays in the hips, not the upper body. When she breathes deeper or curls her pelvis toward you, it signals correct traction. If her breathing pauses, lighten the lift or shorten the vertical travel.
After the lift comes the Left Vertical Drop. You return the hips downward along the same angle, still leaning left. This continues the Rocking dynamic but deepens the frictional path on re-entry. The pressure remains Medium, never Hard. The goal here is frictional rhythm, not impact. Keep breathing steady—inhale through the lowering phase, exhale lightly at the moment of bottom contact. This drop finishes the left-side sequence and recharges the muscles evenly. If executed cleanly, she’ll often still her hips slightly, signaling absorption and internal warmth along the right wall. You, in turn, note that feedback and hold baseline stillness for a breath before transitioning.
Now pivot into the Right Lean, the mirror keystroke. From neutral, exhale as your right hip lowers toward the mat, pressing your shaft into her left wall. This motion resets the compass and maintains bilateral balance in your pelvic rhythm. For a Mesomorph, control the descent carefully—your natural strength can make this side feel heavier. Stay shallow, use Light to Medium pressure, and focus on feeling the wall glide, not punch. She’ll show receptivity through a long exhale or a micro tilt of her head toward you. Maintain awareness of your core; too much spinal twist will fatigue your back early, so keep your navel pointing forward even as your hip drops.
The Right Vertical Lift and Right Vertical Drop follow the same mechanical logic as their left-side counterparts, but you may find one side stronger or easier to control. The purpose of practicing both is to train symmetry. Keep your breath pacing identical—inhale to prepare, exhale through the lift or drop—and observe her micro-responses. If the left side draws more engagement, note it in your journal; if the right side feels smoother, build that baseline. For a Mesomorph with below-average length, this alternating rhythm ensures continuous wall contact and prevents overpenetration. The repetition of lean–lift–drop on both sides defines the Egyptian Hip Slide’s unique figure-eight feel inside her body.
Your keystroke training map starts with mastering the Left Lean and Right Lean first. They teach your hips how to angle without torque. Once that feels automatic, add the Vertical Lift to each side to build Rocking into Angling. The Drop comes last, sealing the friction path and teaching control through descent. These four keystrokes—Left Lean, Left Lift, Left Drop, then mirrored Right Lean, Right Lift, Right Drop—interlock like loops in a chain, one side recovering while the other acts. Practicing them separately, one side at a time, strengthens your proprioception and balance before you link them into the full stroke rhythm.
For your body type and size, depth control and rhythm precision are the priorities. Stay under Medium pressure, never drive past the mid 10% zone, and always reset in neutral plank after each triplet of keystrokes. Protect your shoulders by keeping the forearms firmly rooted, spine long, and hips gliding rather than twisting. A single journaling note after your practice might read, “Right wall, shallow angle, Medium pressure, hips stable, breath synced at lift three.”
I am ready to proceed to Module 3 for Egyptian Hip Slide with Body Type Mesomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches.


=======================================================================================================
Module 3 for the Egyptian Hip Slide now chains the keystrokes into a single, seamless rhythm. This is where the stroke begins to breathe as one movement instead of six parts. Start from your clean forearm-plank baseline—spine straight, core active, pelvis neutral. Inhale slowly to expand your rib cage, then exhale to settle your weight evenly through your hips. The rhythm begins on the left side. Lean left as you exhale, allowing the shaft to glide against her right wall. Without pausing, lift your hips vertically while holding the left lean, drawing the friction upward through that wall. Inhale as you drop the hips back down along the same angle. That completes your first mini-arc. On your next inhale, return to center and let your breath refresh the posture. Then repeat the same triplet on the right—lean, lift, drop—pressing along her left wall. The sequence moves like a slow, symmetrical tide from side to side. You are no longer thinking about individual motions; you are breathing through one continuous wave.
Each repetition must flow through the breath rhythm: inhale to prepare, exhale through the action, then inhale again to recover. The breath carries you through every wall change, keeping the tempo consistent and natural. The Egyptian Hip Slide’s character is defined by its lateral rocking—each hip dropping while the other rises—and the subtle vertical lift that keeps friction alive across both walls. This blend of Angling and Rocking makes the stroke multidimensional. The walls are touched in alternation, the head of the penis tracing a mirrored figure-eight pattern inside her. Because your penis length is below five inches, maintaining shallow glide is essential. The full 80% shallow range is your playground, with rare entries into the mid 10%. What you lose in depth, you gain in constant wall clarity. Think of your movement as painting the inside of a vase rather than striking a target.
For a Mesomorph, the biggest risk is overmuscling. Your build gives you strong hips and core, but the stroke only works when the force is dispersed evenly through the body. Keep your rib cage soft, elbows grounded, and let the motion flow from the pelvis, not the shoulders or thighs. The goal is a pendulum feel—hips swinging under a fixed spine, smooth and controlled. If you feel your lower back tightening, your arc is too wide. Shorten it by an inch and slow down. She will show it’s right when her breathing matches yours or her hips subtly lift into your rhythm. If she exhales softly with each side change, the stroke is landing correctly.
The stroke should feel like a conversation between gravity and control. As one hip drops, the other rises to maintain equilibrium. Use your breath to anchor tempo: one full breath cycle per lean–lift–drop set. The rhythm phase transitions naturally through the SSP logic: Tracking happens when you isolate one side and feel how it grips; Flow begins when you alternate sides smoothly; Pinning emerges when you find her preferred wall and linger there in micro-motions. Each state is discovered by awareness, not force. Your job here is to sense which wall her body favors and adjust your sequence to emphasize it without abandoning balance.
When chaining the sequence, return to neutral baseline every few cycles to rest your joints. Inhale deeply, hold neutral plank for a breath, then begin again. This prevents shoulder fatigue and keeps pelvic control sharp. A clean baseline also resets your proprioception, reminding your body what “straight” feels like before tilting again. Over time, you’ll start to feel how each side energizes the next—the torque created by one lean stores energy for the next lift. That kinetic recycling is what makes the Egyptian Hip Slide efficient and hypnotic when done correctly.
Journal in prose after your session, noting what side felt clearer or where your control wavered. One example might read, “Left wall held traction, right lift too high, eased pressure, rhythm steadied by rep eight.” That simple observation loop anchors your SSP tracking. The more you refine your awareness, the more consistent your control becomes.
I am ready to proceed to Module 4 for Egyptian Hip Slide with Body Type Mesomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches.


=======================================================================================================
Module 4 for the Egyptian Hip Slide is where the real refinement begins. This is your Tracking phase—the quiet testing ground where you form hypotheses about what works, gather data through feel, and adjust angle, pressure, and breath accordingly. The focus here is the shallow 80% zone, where precision outperforms power. Start in your neutral forearm-plank baseline. Let your breath drop low into the abdomen and release slowly through the mouth. Your body should feel steady and alert, like an archer holding aim before release. Inhale to prepare, exhale to lean left, pressing into her right wall. The movement is soft, deliberate, exploratory. This is where you define how much lean creates the most consistent wall glide. Hold that position through one full breath, then inhale to return to center. Repeat on the right, noting which side gives clearer traction or smoother resistance.
Tracking is not repetition for endurance; it is repetition for awareness. Each mini-set you run teaches you something about angle and contact. When you lean left and feel her right wall accept the motion with a deeper exhale or a slight pelvic curl, that is confirmation. When her breath stops or her hips shift away, that is data too—pressure too strong, angle off, or timing mismatched. Adjust your lean smaller, or soften to Light pressure, then retest. Always return to neutral after every two or three cycles to keep your joints aligned and your mind focused. Mesomorph bodies fatigue slower, which can mask tension buildup, so you must consciously keep the ribs soft and shoulders unlocked.
As you track each wall, use the SSP loop to keep yourself mentally sharp. Define what you’re testing—maybe it’s left-wall traction or how much breath sync improves rhythm. Hypothesize a change, such as widening the angle by a finger-width or slowing the breath. Execute three slow reps, watching her cues and your own sensations. Then refine by journaling a one-sentence note like, “Left lean shorter, Medium pressure steadier, softer response, stable by rep five.” This keeps the practice scientific and grounded.
In this phase, never rush into the full rhythm. Each keystroke becomes a probe—Left Lean, Left Lift, Left Drop—each one revealing more about how her walls respond to your control. For your body type and size, small differences in angle mean everything. A one-inch deeper drop might change friction from smooth to jarring, so treat every motion as a measurement. Stay mostly in the shallow 80%, occasionally brushing the mid 10% only when her cues—longer exhales, pelvic lift, or stilling—invite it. Overextension will cause you to lose wall clarity, which is your strongest asset at your size.
The breath cycle becomes your metronome. Inhale to set the angle, exhale through the lean, inhale to reset. Keep the tempo slow enough to allow full perception of what’s happening inside her body. This phase teaches you not to chase performance but to read response. The Egyptian Hip Slide is built on duality: you alternate walls externally while she alternates internal engagement. Each side’s feedback informs your next move. That’s how tracking becomes art.
When done correctly, this module feels meditative. You are not thrusting—you are mapping. The body starts to memorize the resistance, elasticity, and breath pattern of each wall. You begin to predict her exhale, feel the pulse in your shaft when traction is perfect, and notice your own internal quiet. This calm awareness is what will later make Flow possible.
A good journaling example after practice might read, “Right wall clearer, shallower lean stronger contact, Light pressure best at slow tempo, both steady by rep seven.” That’s enough to close your loop and reset your learning for next time.
I am ready to proceed to Module 5 for Egyptian Hip Slide with Body Type Mesomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches.


=======================================================================================================
Module 5 for the Egyptian Hip Slide is where everything you’ve tracked becomes one continuous current. This is the Flow phase—the moment the motion stops being practiced and starts being lived. Begin from your neutral forearm-plank baseline, shoulders stacked, spine long, hips level. Take a deep inhale, hold the air for one heartbeat, and release it slowly through the mouth as your hips start their first lean to the left. The shaft glides along her right wall in the shallow 80% zone, carrying the pressure smoothly from base to head. The key here is rhythm integrity—every motion tied to breath, every breath tied to tempo. Think of your pelvis as a pendulum suspended between two invisible points, rocking left and right with measured grace.
As you enter Flow, you’re alternating sides with even timing—Left Lean, Left Lift, Left Drop, then Right Lean, Right Lift, Right Drop—breathing through the entire cycle without pausing for thought. The Angling and Rocking now merge completely. You’re painting both walls in mirrored strokes. For your Mesomorph frame, the temptation will be to power through this rhythm, but Flow lives in control, not force. Keep pressure Medium, no higher. Maintain the glide rather than drive. The strength of your hips should feel harnessed, channeled, balanced through your breath. You’re not pushing against her; you’re drawing her toward you. The motion should feel circular and infinite, like your pelvis is tracing a sideways figure eight in slow motion.
The Flow phase builds stamina differently than brute repetition. Your goal is consistency, not escalation. The SSP loop now runs in the background—Observe, Tweak, Test. When you sense her body aligning with yours, stay there; when she starts breathing faster or shifting her hips into you, that’s your confirmation of rhythm resonance. When her breath stutters or she tightens, it’s a signal to ease pressure or shorten the arc. Because your penis size is below five inches, your success depends on surface engagement—the constant, shallow stimulation of her walls, not deep penetration. Stay inside the shallow 80% with occasional brushes of the mid 10%. This keeps contact steady and eliminates overreach. She will feel filled through consistency, not depth.
Every Flow cycle should last about six to eight breaths before you return to neutral plank for one reset breath. This keeps your shoulders relaxed and your core fresh. Each reset is not a break—it’s calibration. From that neutral moment, re-enter the rhythm seamlessly, like diving back into a current. The alternating wall stimulation becomes hypnotic when done right. You’ll start to sense her breathing match your pattern, her pelvis rolling up to meet your downstrokes, and small sounds aligning with your exhales. These are not coincidences—they are signs of entrainment. You are now leading her nervous system through tempo.
The best metaphor here is a slow metronome under water. Every tick ripples out, smooth and weightless, and both of you move through it as if time were slowed. When you feel that suspension—when the room disappears and only the shared motion remains—you’ve entered Flow. The Egyptian Hip Slide rewards stillness within movement; the less you try to perform, the more natural it feels. Let the breath do the timing. Inhale to prepare, exhale to travel. Let each wall pass feel inevitable, not forced.
For your body type, the main guardrails are load balance and spinal integrity. Keep the core firm so your hips glide, not swing. Watch that your elbows stay directly under your shoulders; if they drift, tension creeps into your neck and breaks the rhythm. If fatigue sets in, drop to a neutral hold, breathe once, and resume. Flow is about control under endurance, not endurance alone. A clean journal line after practice might read, “Figure-eight smooth by rep ten, Medium pressure steady, right wall warmer, breath matched perfectly.”
I am ready to proceed to Module 6 for Egyptian Hip Slide with Body Type Mesomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches.


=======================================================================================================
Module 6 for the Egyptian Hip Slide is the Deep Flow Option—the rare controlled descent into the mid and deep 10% zones. This phase should only occur when your partner’s body clearly invites it through stillness, pelvic curl, or long exhalation. Begin in your neutral forearm-plank baseline, inhale deeply, and feel your core engage without hardening. The Egyptian Hip Slide is not about deep thrusting—it is about selective depth. For a Mesomorph with a shorter shaft, deep access means precision, not reach. Your strength lets you control entry angles perfectly; your task is to use that power to graze the deep wall rather than strike it.
Start the rhythm exactly as in Flow—Left Lean, Left Lift, Left Drop, Right Lean, Right Lift, Right Drop—but as her breath slows and hips draw you in, allow the downward phase of each lift-drop to carry slightly more angle. On the exhale, tilt the pelvis an extra few degrees forward and downward. That subtle change redirects the head of your shaft toward the south wall’s inner slope—the natural gateway to the deep zone. Do not push; let the depth arrive. The pressure should move from Medium to Medium-Hard for one breath, then return to Medium. Think of it as a tide surge, not a strike. Inhale to reset to shallower rhythm immediately afterward.
In this zone, your 80–10–10 discipline becomes sacred. The deep 10% is where the cervix lives. With your length below five inches, you may not touch it, but the energetic presence still matters. Staying mindful prevents over-arching your spine or collapsing your shoulders. Keep the motion compact and circular, never linear. Deep Flow for you is not about distance—it’s about density. She feels the fullness not through penetration, but through your control of pressure and timing. When you manage those perfectly, her body interprets it as depth.
Because your hips are powerful, protect your lower back by maintaining constant engagement in the abdomen. Imagine your pubic bone moving forward and slightly upward, not downward. This prevents compression. Each time you approach the deep zone, exhale to soften your hips rather than tense them. When done right, she will meet you halfway—her pelvis lifting slightly as if to catch the motion. If she holds that upward curl, maintain the stroke there for two to three breaths before retreating to shallower rhythm. If she exhales sharply or her hips roll back, return immediately to shallow work; her body is signaling a boundary.
Lubrication becomes critical in this module. The increased friction of the deep diagonal requires a smooth surface to avoid micro-tears or dryness. Always monitor glide quality. If resistance rises, return to shallow angles and rebuild rhythm from there. Remember, you do not need to stay deep to have impact; a single, precise deep brush can reset her entire body. Treat those deep touches like punctuation marks in a long sentence—rare, deliberate, and felt everywhere.
Mentally, Deep Flow trains restraint. You learn to listen beyond sound—to sense internal response through tension shifts and breath. You will notice the pulse under her navel or the delayed exhale that means you’ve reached the right depth. These are confirmations that you are guiding her nervous system safely. For your Mesomorph body, keep the knees cushioned and the forearms grounded evenly to distribute load. If your shoulders tighten, you’re driving too much from the upper body; drop your chest slightly and let gravity do the work.
Close each set by returning fully to the shallow 80% zone. Take one neutral breath in plank, spine long, and note how the deep touch changes her rhythm. Most often, she will stay quieter, slower, and more responsive afterward. That’s the nervous system recalibrating to your lead. Record a journal line like, “Entered mid 10% with exhale cue, Medium-Hard pressure safe, retreat smooth, hips aligned.” This documents control, not conquest.
I am ready to proceed to Module 7 for Egyptian Hip Slide with Body Type Mesomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches.


=======================================================================================================
Module 7 for the Egyptian Hip Slide is the Pinning Phase—the stage of control that arrives after orgasm, when her sensitivity spikes and your precision determines whether she climbs again or collapses. Here, your role shifts from mover to tuner. You are no longer generating rhythm; you are sculpting response. Begin from the neutral forearm-plank baseline, spine long, breath steady. Let her finish her exhale fully before re-entering contact. The environment should feel slow and hushed, like the room itself is breathing with you.
From this stillness, let the head of your shaft rest shallow—no more than the 80% zone. Inhale softly, and on the exhale, make a small Rocking motion to the left, pressing into her right wall with Light pressure. Hold that angle for a breath, then Rock right. This is micro-movement territory. You are tracing memory into her body, not creating friction. The goal is to observe her involuntary cues: a delayed inhale, a slow pelvic curl, a tremor in her thighs. Those signals show that her body is still processing the stimulation and can be guided back into arousal. When you sense a cue, apply the SSP loop—Observe, Tweak, Test. Stay on that side for two breaths, increase pressure slightly to Medium, and wait. If her hips press in, you’ve reignited the circuit. If she stiffens, retreat to stillness and soften your breath.
Pinning is the art of presence under heat. For a Mesomorph, strength can easily overpower this phase. The correction is to lead through weight distribution rather than muscle. Drop more weight into your forearms and use the hips like a tuning fork, not a hammer. Keep motion confined to a one-inch Rock, no more. The deeper temptation will be to re-enter Flow too early. Resist it. Pinning works because it lets her nervous system integrate. You hold the position just long enough for sensitivity to build, then you test again. Think of it as brushing embers in a fire rather than blowing on flames.
When her breath returns to you—when she exhales in rhythm with your Rocking—you can start layering Angling. Tilt the pelvis slightly downward on the exhale, grazing the south wall for a slow deep glide. Maintain contact only in the mid 10%, never deeper. This tiny shift should feel like the ground moving under water—barely there, but undeniable. She may release a soft sound or roll her hips upward in reflex. That’s your green light to sustain the motion for three slow breaths. Each breath is its own cycle: inhale to set, exhale to stroke, inhale to pause. You are controlling time now.
If her sensitivity peaks too fast, she may arch away or gasp. Return instantly to shallow stillness, keeping the tip just inside her entrance. This resets her nervous system and lets her body choose whether to re-engage. This responsiveness is what builds trust. You are teaching her that pleasure can be safe, guided, and revisited. For your penis size, that responsiveness becomes your superpower. You never lose contact, even at rest. The smaller surface area allows you to sustain subtle friction that longer shafts can’t maintain. Use that advantage to trace circles against her inner lips, barely moving the shaft, just shifting the weight of your hips.
Across the Pinning set, remember to breathe with her. Each shared exhale extends her aftershock into a new wave. When her body grows quiet again, finish with one slow return to neutral plank, spine tall, breath even. Sit in that silence for a few seconds before pulling out; the stillness is part of the integration. Your journaling line might read, “Shallow Rock left-right, Medium pressure steady, breath synced by rep three, aftershocks extended calmly.”
I am ready to proceed to Module 8 for Egyptian Hip Slide with Body Type Mesomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches.


=======================================================================================================


Module 8 for the Egyptian Hip Slide is the Integration Phase—the four-week plan that consolidates everything you’ve learned into a natural, repeatable rhythm. This is not about endurance drills; it’s about transformation through consistency. The goal is to let your nervous system memorize the posture, breath, and motion until your body moves with effortless awareness. Each session begins the same way: forearm-plank baseline, knees cushioned, spine long, head neutral, breath steady. Feel your weight balanced through your forearms and the tops of your feet. Every rep starts and ends from this center. For the Mesomorph frame, discipline means precision—keep your strength measured, not unleashed. The lighter you move, the longer you last.
In week one, focus entirely on posture and the shallow 80%. Ten minutes a session, five breaths per rep, each rep alternating left and right walls. Treat this as muscle meditation. Your only goal is balance—left equals right, breath equals movement. Every time you feel tension rise in your shoulders or lower back, reset to neutral and take one cleansing breath before continuing. This first week hardwires stability and teaches your body to read her micro-cues without chasing them. Your depth limit remains shallow; your rhythm is built on control.
By week two, introduce the Flow phase gradually. Let the Egyptian Hip Slide’s full cycle—Left Lean, Lift, Drop, Right Lean, Lift, Drop—become one continuous pattern of six to eight breaths. Record how pressure and timing shift from one wall to the other. You’ll start feeling her feedback more clearly through warmth, pulse, and breath synchronization. Keep your SSP loop alive: Define what you’re testing, Track your sensations, and Refine based on her cues. This keeps training scientific rather than performative. The journaling example here could be, “Right wall softer after third breath, left wall grip steady, Medium pressure optimal.”
Week three brings Deep Flow testing, but only in brief pulses. Enter the mid 10% zone for two to three breaths at a time, then retreat. Watch her body carefully—stillness, sighs, or a drawn-out exhale mean alignment. Any recoil or pause means stop and reset. This week is about proving your ability to use restraint while maintaining dominance. Keep lubrication checks frequent and stay conscious of spinal load. A Mesomorph’s strength becomes an advantage when it is precise, not aggressive. If fatigue builds, use one neutral-plank breath for every ten active breaths.
In week four, Pinning and Flow merge into mastery. Start with a five-minute Flow rhythm and then shift into Pinning as she peaks or softens. Rock left-right in one-inch arcs, Light to Medium pressure, three breaths per side. The aim is not another orgasm; it’s awareness. You’re learning to guide her system after climax, showing that you can sustain presence long past your own release. Your stamina becomes spiritual here—control without strain, attention without effort. By the end of this week, your Egyptian Hip Slide should feel like breathing underwater: smooth, slow, and inevitable.
Across all weeks, rest hygiene is critical. For your body type, never train more than five active sets per day. Joint load increases with repetition, so protect your wrists and shoulders by maintaining direct stacking and distributing force through the core. Each session ends with three neutral-plank breaths followed by one reflection line in your journal. A good example would be, “Mid Flow held for six breaths, alignment clean, pressure balanced, warmth steady.” Over time, these notes become your diagnostic map—proof that control, not effort, defines mastery.
This four-week progression transforms the Egyptian Hip Slide from a learned sequence into a reflex. By the final week, you should no longer think in steps or corrections. The motion becomes intuitive, the breath automatic, the rhythm alive. What began as training becomes language—a way of speaking through your hips that her body understands instantly. That is the true integration of technique and presence.
