This module teaches you how to build the foundation for the Ruumba stroke, starting with body position, breathing, and safe leverage. Begin in a forearm plank on the edge of your bed or mat. Your elbows stay directly below your shoulders, forearms flat, fists relaxed. Keep your knees slightly apart to reduce joint load, and drop your hips just enough to feel the line from your chest to your thighs form one solid plank. For an endomorph body type, focus on keeping the rib cage lifted away from the floor—this prevents belly weight from compressing your diaphragm and helps you breathe fully. With a 5–7 inch length, this baseline sets your ideal entry depth, preventing accidental deep pressure during later chaining. Inhale through the nose to prepare, exhale through the mouth to feel the belly draw inward slightly, which firms the base and clarifies wall contact later.
Now map your compass. Picture her pelvis as a clock face beneath you: twelve o’clock is toward her navel, six is toward her spine, three and nine are her inner walls. You’ll be working primarily between ten and two for the Ruumba. Keep your hips just low enough that the head of your shaft can move along that upper quadrant without pushing deep. This stays within the shallow 80% range—the safe zone for training. Light pressure only. Think of your forearms as the suspension system of a car: small shifts in them control how your hips rise and fall. Rocking happens from your knees and hips, angling happens by adjusting your forearm line. Alternate between them to feel how your body distributes weight without strain. Endomorphs should slow each angle change to half speed to avoid shoulder fatigue.
Once you feel stable, bring in breath rhythm. Inhale as your hips draw slightly back, exhale as they glide forward along that ten-to-two path. The motion is not thrusting—it’s tracing. Each forward pass should stop before you feel any tension in your lower back or knees. Your goal is to teach your nervous system to recognize neutral. After every two to three breaths, pause, drop to the neutral plank, and scan for tension. Shoulders relaxed. Core lightly engaged. Hips floating. This reset keeps your body symmetrical, which is critical for pressure consistency later in the stroke. Journal in shorthand after each short set: “NW wall / shallow / light@6 reps.” This helps you track stability without breaking flow.
If you feel your chest collapsing or your breath shortening, widen your knees slightly and re-anchor your elbows. Endomorph frames often gain more control with a lower hip line and tighter abdominal pull on each exhale. The metaphor here is like mopping the floor—your torso guides the handle, but the work happens in smooth circles powered from your center, not your arms. Let the movement come from your hips, not your shoulders. After five or six breath cycles, rest fully flat for two full inhales before repeating. Each rest window allows your joints to decompress and your nervous system to absorb coordination patterns.
By the end of this orientation, your body should feel grounded, balanced, and able to reset into neutral without hesitation. This posture becomes the root for all keystrokes in the Ruumba. When you can enter, hold, and exit this forearm plank smoothly with stable breathing and no joint stress, you’re ready to move into the keystroke breakdown phase.

=========================================================================================
This module teaches you the core keystrokes that make up the Ruumba stroke. Each one is a building block that you’ll eventually chain into a continuous flow. Stay in your forearm plank baseline from before—elbows anchored, knees apart, hips low enough that the head of your shaft can trace the upper quadrant of her walls. Keep your breath slow and audible, your exhale guiding each movement. For an endomorph frame, take longer exhales to manage core pressure and reduce shoulder strain. With a 5–7 inch range, your focus remains in the shallow 80%, where sensation is richest and control develops fastest.
The first keystroke is the Arc Rock. Begin from neutral, exhale and draw your hips slightly back and right, tracing a crescent path toward her one o’clock wall, then inhale as you return to center. On the next exhale, mirror that motion to the left side toward eleven o’clock. Think of it like a pendulum swinging under your ribcage—slow, controlled, continuous. This Rocking action strengthens your ability to maintain contact through light lateral curve instead of straight thrust. Keep the pressure light to medium, adjusting with breath. Each cycle is one full inhale and exhale. Endomorphs should watch for shoulder compression; if your traps tighten, lower your hips and widen your base. Journal shorthand: “Arc Rock L/R shallow@8 reps.”
The second keystroke is the Slide Press. From neutral, inhale, and as you exhale, let your hips glide forward along the twelve o’clock line, pressing lightly into the upper wall before releasing back. Stay in the shallow 80%. Do not chase depth—this motion trains frontal wall sensitivity. The movement should feel like ironing out a wrinkle: smooth, even, and pressure controlled. For 5–7 inches, keep your pelvic tilt slightly tucked to avoid over-extension. Pressure is medium on the exhale, light on the inhale return. Use your breath as your metronome—two seconds forward, two seconds back. Journal: “Slide Press 12 wall / light-med@10 reps.”
The third keystroke is the Anchor Pulse. Begin from the forward position of your Slide Press. Keep the tip anchored against the wall, then pulse from your hips in micro-waves—tiny Rocking motions driven by breath rather than muscle. Inhale, hold, exhale through two to three small pulses, then release back to neutral. This movement develops pelvic finesse and nerve control. For an endomorph, maintain a low center of gravity to protect the lumbar spine; avoid pushing with your arms. Her likely cue will be a subtle pelvic curl or breath catch—evidence that the wall pressure is steady. Journal: “Anchor Pulse upper wall@6 reps.”
The fourth keystroke is the Diagonal Drift. From neutral, angle your hips slightly so your left forearm is fractionally ahead of your right. Exhale as you trace from ten o’clock down to four o’clock, inhale to return. Reverse sides after six cycles. This movement introduces Angling logic to your stroke—pressure diagonals that explore inner walls without thrust. Keep the depth shallow to mid. For 5–7 inches, this ensures wall contact without touching cervix territory. Use light pressure and rhythmic breathing. Journal: “Diag Drift L/R shallow@5 reps.”
The fifth and final keystroke is the Reset Lift. This is your recovery motion and prevents endurance loss. From neutral, inhale deeply, lift your hips slightly off contact for one count, then exhale and lower them gently back into position. It’s a micro-break that resets your circulation and spinal alignment. Endomorphs should emphasize this reset every five cycles to prevent heat buildup in the shoulders and knees. Journal: “Reset Lift neutral@3x per set.”
Each of these keystrokes should now feel distinct but related, like words from the same language. You can identify how Rocking and Angling shift weight, how pressure connects to breath, and how your body stabilizes through resets. When each movement can be done cleanly and without joint fatigue, you’re ready to combine them into the full Ruumba stroke pattern.

=========================================================================================


This module teaches you how to assemble the full Ruumba stroke by chaining the keystrokes you’ve already trained—Arc Rock, Slide Press, Anchor Pulse, Diagonal Drift, and Reset Lift—into one rhythmic sequence. The goal here is not speed, but flow: each keystroke should melt into the next without losing baseline alignment. Begin in your forearm plank, knees spread just enough for pelvic swing, spine long, and shoulders relaxed. Your breath is the rhythm engine. Inhale to prepare, exhale through every movement that applies pressure. For an endomorph frame, widen your stance slightly and maintain lower hip carriage to protect your lumbar line. With a 5–7 inch range, your compass should remain mostly in the shallow 80%, grazing the mid 10% only when the rhythm demands a deeper reach.
Start with the Arc Rock, using your hips to trace a left-right pendulum across her inner walls. As your exhale completes to the right, begin a Slide Press forward on the next breath. Feel how the forward motion meets the wall at twelve o’clock; don’t jab, glide. Your inhale pulls you back toward center as your hips settle into the next Arc Rock to the opposite side. You are now feeling the first pulse of rhythm—rock, slide, rock. Let it breathe, two seconds in, two seconds out. As you repeat this loop, you’ll notice her breath aligning with yours; her pelvis might begin to follow the pendulum motion without conscious effort.
Once this pattern feels smooth, integrate the Anchor Pulse at the forward end of your Slide Press. Keep the tip anchored against her frontal wall, then send two or three small hip pulses on your exhale before you rock to the opposite side. This anchors sensation and builds charge before you move laterally again. She will likely respond with stillness or a subtle pelvic draw, showing that pressure is landing exactly on the nerve cluster. Use this cue to stay there one extra breath before restarting the swing. Journal line: “Ruumba chain – Rock/Slide/Pulse@12 shallow-med pressure, breath match steady.”
Now add the Diagonal Drift. After your rightward Rock, angle your hips slightly, tracing from ten to four o’clock before sliding back to center. This brings the left diagonal wall into play and reintroduces rotation. Feel the movement as a looped figure-eight driven from your hips, not your shoulders. Maintain shallow depth for the majority of cycles. For endomorph structure, the key is weight distribution—keep forearms pressed evenly so the torso doesn’t twist under load. The 5–7 inch range favors precision over penetration; when your compass stays shallow, you preserve clarity and avoid friction loss. Journal: “Diag Drift add – shallow loops@6.”
After four or five complete rhythm cycles, use the Reset Lift. Inhale fully, lift hips slightly, and exhale as you lower back to neutral. This keeps blood flow even, resets your spine, and prevents overstimulation. Think of it like surfacing for air between long dives—it lets your system recharge without losing tempo. On her end, this brief pause reads as a teasing withdrawal; her body may reach or tilt upward. Observe this cue and smile internally—she’s tracking you now.
Each element in this chain serves a distinct role: the Arc Rock maintains wall coverage, the Slide Press centers your line, the Anchor Pulse delivers focal stimulation, the Diagonal Drift adds variety, and the Reset Lift keeps your form sustainable. When linked correctly, the Ruumba feels less like thrusting and more like tracing a gentle, rhythmic dance across her internal landscape. You should be breathing smoothly, sweating lightly, but never straining. The entire body should move as one integrated pendulum. When your awareness can stay on her cues rather than your effort, the stroke is complete.

=========================================================================================




This module teaches you how to enter the tracking phase of the Ruumba stroke—where you run your SSP loop to test, observe, and refine your shallow 80% technique. You are no longer learning the movements themselves; you are learning how to listen through them. Begin in your baseline forearm plank, elbows under shoulders, knees slightly open for pelvic control. Stay in the shallow 80% depth zone only. That’s where the body gives you the clearest feedback and where the nervous system learns fastest. For an endomorph frame, drop the hips a touch lower than your ribs to stabilize leverage. With 5–7 inches, your ceiling on pressure is medium—strong enough to engage the walls, light enough to leave room for nuance.
The SSP loop begins with Define and Hypothesize. Choose one wall—say, the upper at twelve o’clock. Define what you want to test: angle, pressure, or tempo. For example, you might hypothesize that a slightly firmer exhale at the top of each Slide Press gives more response. Breathe in, set your compass, and on the exhale, press lightly forward, holding contact just long enough to feel resistance soften. Stay for one or two breath cycles, then pull back to neutral and note what changed. Her cue may be a deeper breath, a pelvic tilt, or stillness. Those are confirmation signals. If she shifts away or exhales sharply, that’s rejection—adjust your angle or lighten pressure. Journal shorthand: “12 wall, med press@6 reps, +pelvic draw=accept.”
Move into Track and Observe. Run short sets of six to eight strokes, alternating Arc Rock and Slide Press. Keep breath timing steady—inhale on pullback, exhale through motion. Focus on what your hips feel returning through the shallow zone: suction, warmth, glide, or resistance. For an endomorph, this is where joint load can creep up; spread weight across both forearms to avoid shoulder fatigue. Each micro-adjustment teaches your body how pressure translates into sensation. If you notice drift in your path, pause and perform a Reset Lift. Inhale, lift the hips an inch, exhale and settle back into true alignment. That single reset clears your proprioception like recalibrating a compass.
Now Refine and Re-Test. Change one variable at a time. If your last set used light pressure, test medium. If your rhythm was two seconds per cycle, test three. Observe whether her hips respond with more draw or if she goes still. These physical responses are your data. Use them to tune your next hypothesis. For 5–7 inches, you’ll find the sweet spot usually appears when your pelvic angle is tucked slightly under—this keeps the glans gliding along the upper wall’s nerve line rather than bouncing off it. Journal: “Tuck@80%, med press = stronger pull.”
Tracking is not about pleasing her yet—it’s about building sensitivity in you. Feel the wall as terrain, not obstacle. Every inhale prepares awareness; every exhale transmits signal. Imagine tracing the edge of a paintbrush along paper—you’re collecting feedback, not pushing pigment. Each five-cycle window should end with a neutral reset, two full breaths, then notes in shorthand. Over time, these entries become your personalized map of her internal architecture and your own motor control.
By the end of this module, you should be able to define, test, and refine without breaking rhythm or form. Your hips know where shallow precision lives. Your breath knows how to pace pressure. Your journal becomes a living record of pattern recognition. This is the science phase of mastery—where data and intuition merge.

=========================================================================================


This module teaches you how to enter and sustain Flow in the Ruumba stroke. Tracking taught you control; Flow teaches surrender inside that control. The purpose here is to keep motion continuous without losing alignment or sensory precision. Begin in your neutral forearm plank, breath deep and rhythmic, body weight balanced evenly between elbows and knees. For an endomorph, widen the base slightly and drop the hips an inch lower to maintain balance and reduce shoulder fatigue. With a 5–7 inch range, keep your focus in the shallow 80%, occasionally brushing mid 10% only when her body clearly invites it through pelvic pull or breath deepening.
Start by letting your Arc Rock lead the rhythm. The hips swing slowly left and right, tracing that pendulum path you trained earlier. As your exhale carries you toward one side, allow the Slide Press to emerge naturally at the end of the swing—like a tide cresting and spilling forward. This turns Rocking into a forward-glide loop without breaking contact. Inhale as you return to center, exhale through the next diagonal. The Ruumba Flow isn’t built from thrusts—it’s drawn by continuous weight shifting. Feel your pelvis as a hinge connecting upper and lower halves of your body; your movement should be smooth enough that her breathing begins to unconsciously match yours. When her hips start circling in the same tempo, you’ve entered Flow.
Once the rhythm stabilizes, weave in the Anchor Pulse. As your Slide Press completes against her upper wall, pause for a fraction of a breath, anchor the tip, and send two gentle pulses from the hips. Keep pressure light to medium; your exhale should guide each pulse like a soft wave against the shore. This adds a heartbeat inside the rhythm—tiny bursts that heighten her nerve response while keeping your control intact. For an endomorph, emphasize core support over limb strength; the more relaxed your upper body, the cleaner your pelvic articulation. Her cue will likely be a brief stillness or low moan—the body absorbing, not resisting. Journal: “Flow + Pulse shallow@med pressure, matched breath.”
Now add the Diagonal Drift between Rock and Slide. This introduces Angling into the flow, shifting stimulation across inner walls. As you swing left, trace diagonally toward four o’clock, then slide back across to ten o’clock. This keeps sensations unpredictable but smooth. Maintain shallow depth on all transitions—only 80%—and let mid-zone pressure happen naturally if her hips follow. For 5–7 inches, this balance gives full wall contact without jamming against depth limits. The rhythm should feel like tracing an infinity sign from within her, body never leaving its groove. Inhale as you cross center, exhale as you sweep outward.
At steady state, you are cycling through Rock → Slide → Anchor → Rock → Drift → Reset. Each keystroke interlocks into an unbroken sequence. You should feel your breath and her body synchronize—each exhale sending a soft pulse of sound or motion back toward you. When that happens, don’t speed up. Hold the tempo. Let Flow build through repetition, not effort. For endomorphs, this is the phase to guard endurance: use the Reset Lift every five to six cycles, inhaling to lift and exhaling back down. That micro-break keeps form alive without killing rhythm.
If her cues grow quieter—less movement, slower breath—it means her attention is internal. Stay there. If she starts pressing upward, lightly increase pressure or shift to the opposite diagonal. Use your SSP awareness to test one subtle change, observe, then settle. Flow isn’t something you force; it’s what happens when precision and relaxation meet. Your body now knows the mechanics. This module teaches you to trust them enough to disappear inside the rhythm.
Ready to proceed to Module 6 for Ruumba with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=========================================================================================


This module teaches you to explore the deep option within the Ruumba stroke—a controlled descent into the mid and deep 10% zones without losing the Flow rhythm you’ve already built. The aim is not to go deeper for the sake of intensity but to use depth as an instrument for resonance. Begin as always in your neutral forearm plank, spine long, breath steady. For an endomorph, maintain wide knee placement to open pelvic rotation while reducing lumbar load. With 5–7 inches, deep exploration must be incremental; your natural limit will likely land at the entry to the deep 10%, never at full depth. The focus is on maintaining continuous feedback from her body rather than chasing bottom contact.
Start by anchoring in shallow 80%. Breathe deeply through your nose, exhale through pursed lips. On the next inhale, allow a slow Slide Press forward, maintaining your pelvic tuck so the glans travels along the upper wall instead of driving straight in. Exhale as you move forward; this breath keeps your core engaged and prevents the spine from collapsing. Stop where resistance first changes texture—from yielding warmth to firmer compression. That is the threshold between shallow and mid. Hold there, hovering in the 10% zone, and observe. Her breath may deepen, her hips may tilt to meet you, or she might still completely—each cue tells you whether this depth is welcome.
If you feel acceptance, stay within the mid 10% for two or three breath cycles, performing subtle Arc Rocks—small left-right hip motions no more than a finger-width each way. Keep pressure medium and continuous, like tracing a slow wave through thick honey. For 5–7 inches, this maintains full wall contact without pressing into the cervix. If you sense her exhale elongate or a soft moan emerge, it means you’ve matched her nerve saturation point. If her body tenses or breath catches, retreat immediately by inhaling and lifting the hips slightly—a controlled Reset Lift that brings you back into the shallow 80%. Journal: “Ruumba deep test@mid zone, med pressure, accept cue = deep breath.”
To explore the deep 10%, wait until lubrication is high and her hips actively follow your motion. Use the Diagonal Drift to enter diagonally—angle your pelvis slightly left or right so that the head slides under the cervix rather than striking it. Exhale as you enter; inhale to pull halfway back. Never stay in this range for more than three continuous cycles without a reset. For endomorph builds, the key is joint conservation: shift some weight forward into your forearms so the motion comes from the hips, not the lower back. The deep zone is where overstimulation risk is highest, but also where resonance builds—the feeling of her inner walls hugging and drawing with each exhale. You’ll know you’ve reached the safe limit when you feel a natural magnetic pull on the retreat, not resistance on entry.
Once you’ve mapped her mid and deep tolerances, return to shallow rhythm and let the contrast do the work. Alternating one deep pass within four or five shallow cycles gives the body waves of tension and release. This pattern heightens her responsiveness while keeping you sustainable. Keep pressure within the medium band, adjusting to light as soon as her cues fade or lubrication decreases. For the 5–7 inch range, this alternation produces the richest texture—a sense of depth without friction overload.
At this stage, Flow Deep means sensitivity, not dominance. You are maintaining the same breath rhythm—inhale through pullback, exhale through forward drift—but allowing depth to fluctuate within safe gates. Her feedback is now micro-level: pelvic pulse, internal suction, or a whispered sigh. Follow those signals, not your urge to push. By the end of this module, you should know exactly where her mid and deep edges live, how to reach them without strain, and how to retreat cleanly into shallows that feel electric after every descent.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for Ruumba with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


=========================================================================================


This module teaches you how to use the Ruumba stroke to pin her energy after orgasm and guide it into multiples. You are no longer trying to build intensity—you are stabilizing it. Begin in your neutral forearm plank, breath low in the belly, hips hovering at the same height as your ribs. After her first climax, her body is hypersensitive, the canal softer and warmer, the walls fluttering with micro-contractions. Your job is to hold the space through controlled pressure and rhythm micro-adjustments, not motion excess. For an endomorph, spread weight evenly across both forearms, widen the knee base, and reduce hip swing amplitude. With 5–7 inches, stay inside the shallow 80% to mid 10%, using gliding pulses rather than thrusts.
Start the pinning sequence with the Arc Rock and Slide Press, but shrink the amplitude to a whisper—half of what you used in Flow. Inhale as you pull back half an inch, exhale as you press forward into her shallow wall. Maintain light to medium pressure. Each motion should feel like brushing the surface of her arousal rather than reigniting it. This keeps her nervous system engaged without overstimulating the cervix or tearing rhythm control. Her cues now will be subtle: a long exhale, a small pelvic curl, or even stillness that signals receptive surrender. Use the SSP loop—Observe, Tweak, Test. Observe how she reacts to small pressure changes. If her breath deepens, test a slightly longer hold at the end of each exhale. If she winces or tenses, retreat to lighter contact or return to shallows for three slow cycles. Journal: “Post-org pin@80%, light press, +breath draw = accept.”
As the body resets after orgasm, you can layer micro-angle adjustments through your Anchor Pulse. Anchor the glans against her upper wall, exhale through two to three gentle pulses driven by the core, not the thighs. The movement should feel like a heartbeat—short, rhythmic, even. Stay aware of your own breath; for an endomorph, belly control is key to stability and stamina. This is your tool for managing load. When fatigue appears in the shoulders or hips, shift weight slightly forward or use a mini Reset Lift—inhale, lift hips an inch, exhale, and sink back down. These pauses do not break the rhythm; they deepen it.
When her body begins responding again—hips drawing in, small tremors along her thighs—that’s the re-entry point for the next orgasm wave. Use your Diagonal Drift to introduce variation. Shift the pelvis one to two inches to the left diagonal, maintaining the same shallow depth. Exhale as you drift, inhale as you return. Each lateral change reawakens different wall zones without adding force. You are guiding her through recovery into renewal. The SSP loop remains active throughout—Observe, Tweak, Test. One variable per window. One breath per adjustment.
Once the second wave begins—her breath quickens, pelvic curl reappears—hold the rhythm steady. You can slightly increase pressure from light to medium, but do not increase speed. Multiples happen because her nervous system trusts the rhythm, not because of escalation. Keep your own breath calm, your body grounded. The Ruumba stroke’s alternating Rock and Slide keeps blood flow consistent without losing nerve precision. Endomorph frames have an advantage here: heavier core mass provides smooth, pendulum-like control when relaxed. Let gravity assist rather than resist it.
Between orgasm waves, return to shallow Rocking with almost no forward motion. These neutral cycles act as grounding phases for both bodies, allowing her to absorb residual charge. The session should end not in exhaustion but in calm expansion—her body open, breathing steady. Journal afterward with one simple sentence noting the most responsive angle and cue you observed, like “Diagonal left@shallow, light pulses, repeat tremor@rep three.” That line will be gold for refining timing next session.

=========================================================================================
This final module gives you the complete four-week integration plan for mastering the Ruumba. The goal now is rhythm ownership—turning the stroke from a set of movements into muscle memory. You already know the mechanics. What remains is embedding them into your nervous system through repetition, reflection, and recovery. Think of this as tuning a drum. Each week tightens precision and deepens relaxation until you can play the entire rhythm from instinct.
Start every session with orientation in the neutral forearm plank. Spend a full minute breathing there before motion begins. For an endomorph, focus on distributing weight evenly and keeping the core firm enough that the hips don’t sag. This posture work alone conditions your shoulders, back, and glutes for sustained rhythm later. During Week One, alternate between Arc Rock and Slide Press, staying exclusively in the shallow 80%. Inhale through center, exhale through each side. The goal is body familiarity—knowing how pressure and depth align without guesswork. Each evening, note one detail that stood out, such as “Left drift easier after exhale.” That small awareness builds the SSP tracking habit.
Week Two connects the keystrokes. Flow between Arc Rock, Slide Press, and Anchor Pulse for sets of six to eight cycles, resting one full breath between each. Keep tempo slow enough that breath and motion stay synchronized. For 5–7 inches, this practice clarifies wall contact while guarding stamina. As fatigue appears, use the Reset Lift—inhale, raise hips one inch, exhale, settle. The reflection each night should track stability: “Better endurance, shoulder tension decreased.” Those micro-notes will guide where posture needs reinforcement.
Week Three adds controlled mid-zone testing. Enter the mid 10% for two or three cycles when lubrication is high and her hips follow. Retreat to shallows immediately after. Alternate one mid-depth glide within four shallow sequences. The purpose is to calibrate depth sensitivity, not to push limits. You’re training the body to sense the difference between invitation and resistance. Endomorph builds require extra pacing here; keep the pelvis engaged, but let your thighs and abs share load evenly. Journal entries might sound like, “Mid@med pressure, soft pull@rep five.” By the end of this week, Flow should feel effortless, pressure variations intuitive.
Week Four shifts to post-orgasm control and long-form Flow. Practice two extended sets: ten cycles of shallow rhythm followed by three of pinning micro-pulses. Rest thirty seconds in neutral between sets. Your mission is to hold energy steady while her cues shift—breath, tremor, stillness. That stillness is your sign of complete regulation, not a lack of response. When your own breathing stays even through the entire set, you’ve achieved integration. Write one clear summary after each session: what compass angle, pressure, or timing created resonance. Example: “Diagonal left, shallow, med pressure, inhale hold smooth@rep six.”
Train three days on, one day off. Rest is part of mastery. Use off days for light stretching and focused breath work—five minutes of controlled inhales through the nose and slow exhales through the mouth. For endomorphs, this resets the spine and hips, preventing fatigue buildup. When you return to practice, your joints will feel lighter and your pelvic drive cleaner.
By the end of four weeks, you should move through the entire Ruumba sequence—Rock, Slide, Anchor, Drift, Pin—with no conscious thought. Her responses will cue your next motion automatically. You will sense depth, angle, and pressure through instinct rather than correction. That is what mastery feels like: when the stroke plays itself through you.
