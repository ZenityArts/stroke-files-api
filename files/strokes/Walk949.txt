Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the start of your transformational journey with the Walk Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m truly excited to embark on this process with you—specifically designed for someone with your mesomorph build and a penis measuring between 5 and 7 inches. Your body is naturally well-balanced, muscular, and agile, providing you with an ideal foundation for controlled and cumulative stimulation. Today, we’re going to harness that natural athleticism and strength and convert it into a precise, rhythmic stroke that maximizes every touch.
First, find a quiet, comfortable space where you can devote your full attention to learning and practicing. Sit back, relax your strong, defined shoulders, and take several deep, calm breaths. Let your mind clear so that you can fully focus on the techniques I’m about to share with you. The Walk Stroke you’re about to learn is rooted in the classic missionary position—but with some key modifications that suit your mesomorph structure and your moderate extension. You’ll start by getting into a modified plank position, with your knees firmly planted on a supportive surface. This is essential because your athletic build thrives on stability—your broad shoulders and solid core need that firm base to allow your movements to be both controlled and deliberate.
Now, once you are set, insert your penis at a downward diagonal angle into your partner. From this starting point, begin to move your entire body smoothly and steadily forward—north toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, imagine that the top shelf of your shaft glides gently across her clitoral region, while the tip of your penis stays in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Since your extension is between 5 and 7 inches, every forward movement must be executed with precision. This is where we bring in the 80‑10‑10 principle. Essentially, about 80% of your applied stimulation should focus on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone—roughly the first 1 to 3 inches—while the remaining 20% is split evenly between the mid‑depth (3–5 inches) and the deep (beyond 5 inches) areas. This ensures that despite your moderate extension, the most sensitive areas get the bulk of the attention.
After that forward drive, we transition into the lateral phase of the stroke. Here, you’ll use your innate mesomorph strength to execute a controlled “tap” movement—what we call the tap keystroke. For instance, raise your right hip laterally in a small, deliberate motion. This lateral shift allows the right side of your penis to apply targeted, firm pressure against the left part of your partner’s vaginal opening, while at the same time, the left side provides a subtle, rocking massage to her right internal wall. Then, gradually lower your raised hip so that the underbelly of your penis applies consistent pressure on her lower wall, while the upper shelf keeps steady contact on her upper wall. Importantly, throughout this entire process, your penis remains inserted—there’s no full withdrawal. Instead, you slowly shuttle backward, maintaining continuous stimulation along the north wall as you reset your position.
Once you return to your initial starting point, you repeat the sequence on the opposite side. This time, you raise your left hip laterally so that the left side of your penis engages the right part of her vaginal opening, then lower and shuttle backward again. This alternating, “walking” motion of your hips creates a rhythmic, cumulative effect that is designed to build stimulation gradually and evenly.
Today’s session sets the foundation. We are going to turn your natural mesomorph strength and balanced form into a precisely controlled performance. Every micro‑movement—from that smooth forward push to the careful lateral taps and the controlled backward shuttle—is designed to deliver cumulative stimulation that aligns perfectly with the 80‑10‑10 principle. Welcome, brother. Let’s begin channeling your athletic power into a performance that is as scientifically precise as it is intimately engaging.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding Your Unique Profile and Anatomy
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re taking a deep dive into your unique anatomical profile as a mesomorph with a penis size between 5 and 7 inches. Your mesomorphic build means you have a naturally athletic and muscular body with excellent balance, strength, and endurance. These qualities provide you with the ideal foundation for controlled, deliberate movements. However, with an extension that falls in the moderate range, every micro‑movement must be finely tuned for maximum effect on a compact stimulation area.
Imagine your body as a finely tuned instrument—a mix of strength and agility. Your strong chest, well-defined arms, and a solid core are what give you the endurance to perform these moves over and over with consistency. At the same time, your extension between 5 and 7 inches gives you a moderate contact area that, while not extensive, is exactly what you need to focus your stimulation where it counts the most. Here, the 80‑10‑10 principle is our roadmap: about 80% of your applied force should be concentrated on the shallow vaginal zone (roughly the first 1 to 3 inches), where nerve endings are most densely packed. The remaining 20% is then evenly distributed between the mid‑depth (3–5 inches) and deep (beyond 5 inches) areas. This means that every forward push and lateral shift must be executed with precision to ensure that the shallow zone receives the bulk of your stimulation without overwhelming the deeper areas.
Your mesomorphic physique also means that you have a high level of body awareness. You can feel the slightest contractions in your core, the subtlest shift in your balance, and every minute detail is noticeable. Use this acute awareness to monitor and adjust your movements. For example, when you move forward or lift your hip for that tap keystroke, be mindful of how your body is reacting. Are you maintaining the correct 80‑10‑10 distribution? Is the majority of your force applying pressure on the shallow zone? Use these internal cues alongside feedback from your partner—her changes in breathing, small verbal affirmations, or shifts in her posture—to continually refine your technique.
The Sexual Scientific Process is also vital in your training. This process involves setting a clear goal for each cycle of the stroke, making small adjustments based on your observations, and tracking the results until you achieve an optimal, cumulative performance. For instance, you might set a goal to ensure that each forward push uniformly targets the shallow zone. Then, by tracking your partner’s responses over several repetitions, you can determine if your angle or force needs to be adjusted. This iterative process of defining your goal, hypothesizing adjustments, tracking results, and refining your technique will enable you to unlock your full potential.
Remember, brother, your unique profile isn’t a limitation—it’s a powerful asset. Your athletic, mesomorph body provides you with the strength and control needed to execute every move flawlessly. By understanding your anatomy and applying the 80‑10‑10 principle along with the Sexual Scientific Process, you’re well on your way to turning every micro‑movement into a cumulative, deeply satisfying performance. Embrace your strengths and get ready to elevate your technique to a whole new level.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Walk Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Walk Stroke into its essential parts so you can master each element individually before integrating them into one seamless motion. Picture yourself in the classic missionary position once again—on top in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on the floor. As a mesomorph with a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every micro‑movement is critical, and we’re going to isolate each phase for intense practice.
We begin with the forward movement. First, insert your penis at a precisely controlled downward diagonal angle. Then, as you move your entire body north toward your partner’s head, feel how the top shelf of your shaft glides smoothly over her clitoral area while your penis head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This initial forward push is designed to set the stage for stimulation by focusing about 80% of your force on the shallow, sensitive area, following the 80‑10‑10 principle. Since your extension is moderate, every forward movement must be perfectly executed so that the shallow zone receives maximum stimulation while still allowing for gentle engagement of deeper areas.
After establishing your forward drive, we shift into the lateral phase. From your forward position, initiate a controlled lateral shift by raising your right hip. This movement is what we call the “tap keystroke” – it is a precise, small lateral lift that creates a gentle tap on the supporting surface. As your right hip rises, the right side of your penis should apply focused, firm pressure against the left portion of her vaginal opening, while the left side initiates a subtle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Perform this lateral tap three times in succession, ensuring that each tap is executed with precision so that the 80‑10‑10 distribution is maintained and the majority of your stimulation hits the shallow zone.
After completing the lateral taps, lower your raised hip gradually. In this lowering phase, feel how the underbelly of your penis begins to exert gentle, cumulative pressure on her lower wall while the upper shelf continues its steady contact with her upper wall. At the same time, slowly shuttle your body backward so that your penis keeps continuous contact with the north wall as you reset your position—without fully withdrawing. This backward shuttle is a critical resetting phase and maintains continuous, cumulative stimulation. Once you’re back at your starting position, mirror the entire cycle on the opposite side. Now raise your left hip laterally so that the left side of your shaft engages the right vaginal opening, then lower and shuttle backward. This alternating “walking” motion of your hips creates a rhythmic pattern that delivers balanced and cumulative stimulation across all zones of her vaginal canal.
Deconstructing the Walk Stroke in this way—forward movement, lateral taps using the tap keystroke, controlled hip lowering, and smooth backward shuttle—provides you with a clear blueprint. Every phase must be executed with pinpoint accuracy to meet the 80‑10‑10 principle and to transform your natural strength and agility into a refined, cumulative performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each individual component of the Walk Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes second nature. With your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, precision and consistency are key. In this module, we’re going to focus on extensive, repetitive practice of each phase—forward movement, lateral tap using the tap keystroke, controlled hip lowering, and the backward shuttle—so that everything flows naturally and adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Start with the forward movement drill. Get into your modified plank position, ensuring your knees are firmly planted to support your sturdy frame. Insert your penis at the exact downward diagonal angle, and slowly push your body forward toward your partner’s head. Concentrate on the contact: feel the top shelf of your shaft glide over her clitoral area while the head remains in consistent engagement with her “south wall.” Because your extension is moderate, make sure that about 80% of your force is directed to the shallow zone. Execute this forward drive slowly and deliberately, repeating it several times until you can confidently recreate the same controlled forward push with absolute consistency.
Next, isolate the lateral component—the tap keystroke. From your forward position, raise your right hip in a small, controlled, lateral shift until your hip makes that gentle tap on the supporting surface. Visualize how the right side of your shaft presses firmly against the left side of her vaginal opening, while the left side simultaneously offers a subtle, rocking massage on her right internal wall. Synchronize each lateral tap with deep, controlled breathing—inhaling before you shift and exhaling as you complete the tap. To further enhance stability and precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during every lateral tap. Drill this lateral movement repeatedly—aim for at least 30 slow and deliberate repetitions on each side—until the motion is fully embedded in your muscle memory.
Then, focus on the lowering phase. After each lateral tap, slowly lower your raised hip back toward the canvas. Feel the gradual increase in pressure as the underbelly of your penis begins to contact her lower wall, while the upper shelf maintains steady stimulation on her upper wall. Finally, practice the backward shuttle—slowly retract your body while keeping continuous contact with the north wall. Repeat the full sequence—forward movement, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times until every transition is smooth and perfectly aligned with the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Throughout your drilling, keep your breathing deep, slow, and synchronized with every movement. Each inhale should sharpen your focus, and every exhale should help you ease from one phase to the next. With focused practice, your natural agility, combined with your mesomorph strength and moderate extension, will result in a set of movements that are executed with precision and cumulative intensity.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one seamless, continuous performance—this is the essence of the Walk Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified plank, ensuring your knees are planted firmly, your core is engaged, and your mind is solely focused on fluid integration. In this module, we’ll merge the forward push, lateral taps (via the tap keystroke), controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle into a unified, rhythmic cycle.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly drive your body north toward your partner’s head. As you do, ensure that the top shelf of your shaft continuously caresses her clitoral area, while the head remains in constant, precise contact with her south wall. This phase establishes the base of stimulation and must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle—roughly 80% of your force focused on the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase. Execute three controlled lateral taps by raising your right hip in that carefully practiced tap keystroke. During these taps, ensure the right side of your shaft applies steady, targeted pressure on the left side of her vaginal opening, while the left side produces a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Once the lateral taps are complete, gradually lower your right hip so that the underbelly of your penis maintains continuous pressure against her lower wall, and the upper shelf sustains contact on her upper wall. Then, slowly shuttle your body backward until you return to your starting position, all while ensuring your penis remains in contact with the north wall.
After finishing the cycle on the right side, reset and mirror the sequence on the left. Raise your left hip laterally and perform three deliberate lateral taps—this time, the left side of your shaft engages the right vaginal opening, while the right side provides a complementary rocking sensation on her left internal wall. Lower your left hip gently and shuttle backward until you come full circle. This alternating “walking” motion of your hips creates a rhythmic, cumulative pattern that delivers balanced stimulation across all areas.
Throughout the integrated sequence, let your deep, consistent breathing be the metronome that synchronizes every movement. Inhale deeply before initiating each phase, and exhale steadily as you complete each transition. With each complete cycle, your mesomorph strength and controlled extension merge into a continuous, fluid performance—a Walk Stroke that is both scientifically precise and intimately effective.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, we focus on fine-tuning every micro‑adjustment of the Walk Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your balanced mesomorph physique and a penis size between 5 and 7 inches, precision in every movement is critical. Your goal is to balance your forward drive, lateral taps, and backward shuttling perfectly so that the stimulation consistently follows the 80‑10‑10 principle: about 80% targeting the shallow, highly sensitive zone, with the remaining 20% distributed evenly between mid‑depth and deep regions.
As you cycle through your integrated routine, observe every aspect of your performance closely. During the forward drive, ensure that the top shelf of your shaft consistently grazes her clitoral area while the head remains steadily on her south wall. Then, in the lateral phase, pay special attention to the subtle rocking motion generated by your precise tap keystroke. Even small shifts in your lateral angle can significantly alter the balance of stimulation—experiment with adjusting your tap angle by just a degree or two, and observe the difference in how the stimulation is delivered. Use your partner’s feedback—her breathing, body language, and any soft verbal cues—as critical data points in the Sexual Scientific Process. Define your goal for that cycle (for example, achieving a smoother, more even rocking effect), form a hypothesis on how to modify your lateral movement, then track the responses and fine-tune your technique accordingly.
Maintain your deep, rhythmic breathing throughout every cycle; inhale deeply to activate each micro‑movement, and exhale steadily to smooth the transitions. Over time, this continuous feedback loop—tracking each subtle cue and making meticulous adjustments—will lead you into a state of flow. In that state, every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle becomes automatic and is executed with the exact precision demanded by the 80‑10‑10 principle. This is the hallmark of a perfected Walk Stroke: a seamless, automatic performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply connected to your partner’s pleasure.
Remember, brother, that every tiny adjustment matters. Your balanced mesomorph structure and moderate extension allow you to deliver stimulation that is both rich and precise. Continually monitor your internal cues—the contractions of your core, the engagement of your pelvic floor—and align them with the external feedback from your partner. With relentless tracking and refined adjustments, your Walk Stroke will evolve into a seamless performance, a true expression of cumulative, intimate mastery.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a structured training regimen specifically designed to reinforce every aspect of the Walk Stroke while strengthening the core and overall stability that define your mesomorph body with a penis size between 5 and 7 inches. This module will serve as your roadmap to consistently refining your technique and turning your natural athleticism and balance into a performance that is both scientifically precise and deeply satisfying.
Begin each training session by establishing your own dedicated space—a quiet, private area where distractions are left behind, and every movement is devoted entirely to mastering your technique. Start with an extensive warm‑up tailored to your mesomorph frame. Engage in dynamic stretching that focuses on your core, hips, and lower back, as these areas are the pillars that support every micro‑movement in the Walk Stroke. Visualize each stretch as activating your internal engine, preparing your muscles and joints for the precise actions ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set the tone for a productive session.
Next, dive into specialized drills designed to hone every element of the Walk Stroke. Start with the tap keystroke drill. In your modified plank position—with your knees firmly on the canvas—practice small, controlled lateral taps. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Synchronize each lateral movement with a deliberate breathing pattern—inhaling before the tap, exhaling as you complete it. To further secure control, incorporate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor with each tap, ensuring that the pressure is precise and consistent. Perform at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the lateral tap becomes an automatic, ingrained movement.
Once you have mastered the lateral tap, integrate it with the vertical components. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and a smooth, gradual backward shuttle—always ensuring that your movements adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this complete sequence repeatedly on both sides until every micro‑movement flows naturally together. Supplement these drills with dedicated core-strengthening exercises, such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills. A strong core is indispensable for maintaining balance and precision, supporting every controlled movement in the Walk Stroke. Keep a detailed training journal to record your sessions, the number of repetitions, any minor adjustments, and your partner’s feedback. This journal is essential as part of the Sexual Scientific Process, allowing you to track progress, identify what works best, and refine your technique continuously.
Your personalized routine is your blueprint to mastery, brother. With every session, you transform your natural mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and ultimately, deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Walk Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance. This is where your mesomorph power and your penis size between 5 and 7 inches come together in a flawless, rhythmic expression of cumulative stimulation. In this final module, we’ll troubleshoot any imperfections, fine‑tune every micro‑adjustment, and ensure that your technique is as precise as it can be.
Settle into your training space with absolute focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees securely on the surface, your core engaged, and your mind solely fixed on precision. Begin by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your shaft consistently caresses her clitoral region, while the head keeps constant, deliberate contact with her south wall. Every move here must strictly follow the 80‑10‑10 principle, with the majority of your force directed at the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by initiating the tap keystroke with your right hip. Raise your hip in a compact, deliberate motion and perform three precise lateral taps. With each tap, focus intently on the way the right side of your shaft applies targeted, steady pressure to the left side of her vaginal opening, while the left side delivers a subtle, rhythmic rocking effect on her right internal wall. If any tap seems off—if the pressure is uneven or the movement lacks precision—pause and isolate that specific component. Drill it until you’re confident that the stimulation is perfectly balanced according to the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Next, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position. As you execute the pushout, pay careful attention to the contraction of your core, the engagement of your pelvic floor, and any subtle feedback from your partner. Use these cues to make small adjustments—perhaps a slight tweak in your lateral angle or a more measured pace in your forward drive—to ensure that your cumulative stimulation is optimal. This iterative process of defining your goal, hypothesizing adjustments, tracking feedback, and refining your technique is the essence of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’ve fine‑tuned your technique, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously: forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle. Then mirror the sequence on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation across all areas. The ultimate aim is to reach a state of flow—where every micro‑movement is automatic, perfectly precise, and seamlessly integrated. Celebrate this moment, brother, because it signifies that you have transformed your raw mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a fluid, cumulative performance that is both scientifically optimized and intimately satisfying.
Happy training, brother. Your dedication to refining every detail, your disciplined practice, and your commitment to the Sexual Scientific Process will transform your Walk Stroke into an art form that brings deep, cumulative stimulation to your partner. Keep tracking, keep refining, and let each flawless cycle be a testament to your journey toward intimate mastery.
