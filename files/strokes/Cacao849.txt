Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformative journey with the Cacao Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and it’s my honor to work with you—a strong, full‑figured endomorph with a penis measuring between 5 and 7 inches. Your body is built for endurance and raw power; with a solid, stable frame, you generate an incredible amount of force and stability in every movement. Even though your extension is compact compared to some, every inch is loaded with sensitivity—and when you harness that sensitivity with precision, you’ll deliver an intensely focused, cumulative stimulation that will leave a lasting impression. Today, we’re going to transform your natural, powerful physique into a finely tuned performance that seamlessly blends scientific technique with intimate artistry.
Picture this: you’re stepping into your personal training sanctuary, a quiet and comfortable space where distractions fade away and only your focus remains. You settle in, relax your broad, powerful shoulders, and take several deep, slow breaths. With each breath, you feel your body relax and your mind sharpen, preparing you to commit fully to this session. In this program, we modify the classic missionary position to suit your unique endomorphic build. You begin by assuming a modified plank position—knees firmly planted on a stable surface that can support your heavy‑set frame. This foundational stance is essential because it anchors your entire body, allowing every micro‑movement to be executed with absolute control and deliberate precision.
With your body securely anchored, you then insert your penis at a precisely controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. That initial alignment isn’t arbitrary; it’s your blueprint, the starting point that will determine all subsequent force, angles, and pressure points in your stroke. Your journey begins with a deliberate, smooth forward push. As you gradually push your body forward toward your partner’s head, the top shelf of your compact extension glides gently over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension falls within the 5 to 7‑inch range, it’s crucial that you focus approximately 80% of your applied force on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches where sensitivity is highest. The remaining 20% of your force is evenly distributed between the mid‑depth and deep areas, ensuring a balanced, cumulative stimulation that enhances pleasure without overwhelming any one zone.
After the forward push, the Cacao Stroke evolves into its signature full‑body phase. Your stroke is defined by a series of movements that utilize your strength and stability: first, you execute two slow stir movements to one side; then you perform two slow hip rotations; finally, you incorporate a leg raise as you shuttle your body forward. For your robust endomorphic build, every movement has to be measured—a gentle stir here, a deliberate rotation there—to ensure that your powerful frame doesn’t overshadow the sensitive stimulation needed for maximum pleasure. And here’s where the “douplo” element comes in: once you complete the sequence on one side, you immediately mirror that exact sequence on the other side. This dual‑phase structure ensures that both sides of the vaginal canal receive equal, balanced stimulation. Every forward push, every stir, every hip rotation, and every leg raise builds cumulatively upon the last, channeling your natural, raw power into a refined, intimate performance. Welcome, brother—today we begin the process of turning your raw potential into a masterful expression of intimate control with the Cacao Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Alright, brother, now that you’re comfortably in your training space, let’s dive into the principles that form the backbone of your technique. These core elements ensure that every movement in your Cacao Stroke is deliberate, cumulative, and perfectly tuned to deliver intense pleasure.
First, the 80‑10‑10 principle. Imagine that you’re holding the exact balance of force in your hands: about 80% of your applied force must be focused on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—where nerve endings are most densely packed and sensitivity peaks. The remaining 20% is split equally, with 10% directed at the mid‑depth region (roughly 3 to 5 inches) and 10% at the deep area (beyond 5 inches). For you, working with a compact extension in the 5 to 7‑inch range, this means that your powerful, stable body must deliver concentrated stimulation exactly where it counts while still providing a balanced touch in the deeper regions. This balanced force distribution is what allows you to trigger the maximum pleasurable response without overloading any one area.
Next, let’s talk about the Sexual Scientific Process. This process is like running a finely tuned experiment with your body. You begin by defining your goal: for example, you might aim to maximize the friction on a particular wall of her vaginal canal during your stir movements. Then, you form a hypothesis—perhaps you suspect that performing the stir more slowly will yield a more pronounced cumulative effect. Now comes tracking, which is essential. While executing your stroke, you pay close attention to both your own internal cues—how solid your core feels, how well your pelvic floor is engaging—and to your partner’s responses. Tracking is primarily about identifying exactly which areas of her vaginal canal are being most pleasurably massaged at that moment, so that you can adjust your stroke accordingly. You might perform 30 repetitions on each “wall” and note her rhythmic breathing, any subtle verbal cues, or slight shifts in her posture. This real‑time feedback is invaluable in fine‑tuning your technique.
Once you have tracked and analyzed the feedback, you then move into a state called flow. Flow is that magical state where every movement in your stroke becomes automatic—a continuous, rhythmic sequence where you’re massaging her most sensitive spots with just the right pressure and pace. When you’re in flow, you’re not even thinking about each step; your body moves seamlessly, applying the 80‑10‑10 distribution without effort, and that rhythmic, cumulative stimulation is what drives her to climax.
Last but not least, we have the tap keystroke, a foundational drill for perfecting your lateral movements. Picture yourself in a forearm plank; then, shift laterally until your hip gently taps the surface, and then return smoothly to center. This seemingly simple movement is critical—it builds the muscle memory and strengthens your pelvic floor so that every lateral movement is executed with pinpoint accuracy. With synchronized deep breathing (what we call stroke breathing) and integrated kegeling, the tap keystroke drill ensures that every lateral component of your stroke is precise, controlled, and contributes to cumulative stimulation exactly as prescribed by the 80‑10‑10 principle.
These core elements work together in a harmonious cycle. The 80‑10‑10 principle tells you exactly how to distribute your force, the Sexual Scientific Process guides you through continuous refinement by tracking her feedback and achieving flow, and the tap keystroke drill guarantees the precision of every lateral shift. With these powerful tools in hand, you’re fully equipped to execute your Cacao Stroke with scientific precision and cumulative intensity.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Cacao Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Cacao Stroke into its essential, fundamental components so you have a clear roadmap for each movement. This stroke is designed for ectomorphs like you, with a moderate extension between 5 and 7 inches, combining full‑body motion with cumulative, targeted stimulation. The Cacao Stroke unfolds in a dual‑phase structure: first, you execute the entire sequence on one side (we’ll start with the right), and then you mirror that exact process on the opposite side for balanced stimulation across the vaginal canal.
You begin in the classic missionary setup, with your knees planted firmly on the canvas and your penis inserted at a precisely controlled downward diagonal angle. This initial insertion is crucial—it serves as your blueprint, aligning your body so that every subsequent movement falls into place and adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Your stroke starts with a smooth forward push: you slowly move your entire body northward toward your partner’s head, feeling the top shelf of your extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region while the head stays in steady, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” In this phase, approximately 80% of your applied force is directed to the shallow, highly sensitive zone, ensuring that the nerve‑rich area gets maximum stimulation, while the mid‑depth and deep layers receive just enough contact to maintain overall balance.
Immediately following the forward push, you transition into the lateral phase on the right side. First, you perform two slow, deliberate stir movements to the right. In these stirs, think of your body as drawing a full circle around your belly button—like a pencil tracing a circle on the ground. As you make these circles, the hilt of your penis moves along the circumference of her vaginal opening, gently canvassing every segment and applying cumulative pressure. The objective during the stir is to ensure that the entire perimeter gets a soft, continuous massage, yet all the while keeping the majority of your force focused on the shallow zone.
After the stirs, you move into two slow hip rotations to the right. Here, your hips rotate in a controlled arc, shifting the pressure of the hilt along her vaginal opening from one segment to another—specifically, from the northwestern section gradually toward the southwestern section. Simultaneously, your penis reorients so that the head points toward the southeastern wall initially and then transitions upward to softly massage the northeastern wall. These rotations are executed very deliberately, ensuring that each segment is massaged with a cumulative, controlled pressure that stays true to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Following the hip rotations, you finish the right‑side sequence with a right leg raise coupled with a forward shuttle. As you slowly lift your right leg, your body continues its northward movement toward her head. During this leg raise, the hilt applies an extra dose of targeted pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis is oriented to create focused friction along her northwestern wall. This leg raise introduces a dynamic element that intensifies the cumulative stimulation.
Once you’ve completed the right‑side sequence—forward push, right stirs, right hip rotations, and right leg raise—you then mirror the identical movements on the left side. On the left, you repeat the entire process: a forward push that maintains the 80‑10‑10 distribution, two slow stirs to the left where your body traces a circular pattern and the hilt canvases the vaginal opening, followed by two slow hip rotations to the left that shift pressure from the northeastern to the southeastern segments, and finally a left leg raise that reinforces targeted friction. Mirroring the sequence ensures that both sides of her vaginal canal receive equally balanced, cumulative stimulation in a harmonious “W” pattern.
Each segment of the Cacao Stroke is meticulously designed to adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that about 80% of your force is always focused on the shallow, sensitive zone, while the remaining force is delicately balanced to softly engage the deeper tissues. This deconstruction gives you a clear, actionable blueprint of every micro‑movement—from the forward push that sets up the stroke to the stirs, hip rotations, and leg raises that build cumulative intensity. With this roadmap in hand, you’re ready to drill and eventually integrate these components into a fluid, continuous performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each component of the Cacao Stroke until every movement is as natural as your own breath. With your lean ectomorphic build and a moderate extension between 5 and 7 inches, precision is paramount. In this module, we’re going to practice each element individually and then in combination, ensuring that every repetition adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Start by working on the forward push. Get into your modified plank position with your knees securely planted on a stable, supportive surface. Insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle, then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Focus intensely on the sensation: you should feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because you have a moderate extension, about 80% of your force is directed towards the shallow, sensitive vaginal zone. Repeat this forward push slowly and deliberately until every repetition is smooth, controlled, and perfectly consistent.
Next, move into the right‑side lateral drills. From your forward push position, begin by performing two slow, deliberate stirs to the right. Visualize your body drawing a perfect circle with a pencil-like motion from your belly button—each circle must be smooth, ensuring the hilt of your penis canvases around her vaginal opening, applying gentle, cumulative pressure to every segment it touches. Focus on synchronizing these stirs with deep, steady breathing, and drill them until you can execute them flawlessly.
After you have mastered the stirs, transition into the hip rotation drill on the right side. Slowly execute two controlled hip rotations, letting the hilt shift its applied pressure gradually from the northwestern segment to the southwestern section of her vaginal opening. As you rotate, allow your penis to reorient so that the head points toward the southeastern wall and then gradually adjusts upward to massage the northeastern wall. Repeat these rotations until your movement is rhythmic and every nuance of pressure is well controlled.
Now, work on the right leg raise and forward shuttle drill. As you push your body forward, slowly lift your right leg until your knee is raised, and then continue shuttling your body north toward her head. Focus on how the hilt applies additional targeted pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis shifts its angle to maintain friction along her northwestern wall. Drill this combined movement until the leg raise and shuttle become perfectly synchronized with the stirs and hip rotations.
Once you’ve perfected the right‑side drills, mirror them on the left side. Practice two slow stirs to the left, ensuring the hilt canvases the vaginal opening with even pressure, then perform two controlled hip rotations to the left, and finally execute a left leg raise as you shuttle forward. Repeat these drills for at least 30 repetitions per side until each movement becomes completely automatic and adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout all these drills, maintain deep, deliberate breathing. Each deep inhale primes your body for the next precise movement, and every controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions between drills. With consistent, disciplined practice, your lean ectomorphic agility and moderate extension will merge seamlessly into every element of the Cacao Stroke, and every micro‑movement will become as natural and instinctive as your own breath.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to integrate every drilled component into one continuous, seamless performance—the full Cacao Stroke in its entirety. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance, with your knees firmly planted, core fully engaged, and your focus completely on melding these movements together into one fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this integrated cycle, you will combine your forward push, the right‑side components (which include your two slow stirs, two hip rotations, and right leg raise with forward shuttle), and immediately mirror the exact same sequence on the left side to create a balanced, dual‑phase “W” pattern.
Begin with the forward push: insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides gracefully over her clitoral region and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward motion is the foundation of your stroke and must strictly follow the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that approximately 80% of your force is channeled into the shallow, highly sensitive zone.
Immediately after the forward push, transition into the right‑side sequence. Execute two slow, deliberate stirs to the right—imagine your body drawing a precise circle on the z‑axis from your belly button—as the hilt of your penis canvases her vaginal opening, applying gentle pressure with each rotation. Then, perform two controlled hip rotations to the right, allowing the hilt’s pressure to shift smoothly from the northwestern to the southwestern segments, while your penis adjusts its angle to provide an upward massage along her walls. Finally, incorporate the right leg raise as you shuttle your body forward toward her head, ensuring targeted pressure is maintained along the right side of her vaginal opening. Once you’ve completed the right‑side sequence, reset briefly and then mirror the same exact sequence on the left side: a forward push, followed by two slow stirs to the left, two controlled hip rotations to the left, and a left leg raise with forward shuttle. This mirroring creates a rhythmic “W” pattern that ensures both halves of the vaginal canal receive evenly distributed, cumulative stimulation.
Throughout this integrated sequence, let your deep, rhythmic breathing serve as your internal metronome. Every deep inhale should prepare your body for the next micro‑movement, and every controlled exhale should facilitate a smooth, seamless transition. With each complete cycle, your entire Cacao Stroke becomes a fluid, continuous performance that delivers precisely targeted stimulation in strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where we fine‑tune your Cacao Stroke to ensure every movement delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your lean ectomorphic build and a moderate extension between 5 and 7 inches, every micro‑movement matters. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains our guiding star—80% of your force should be focused on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, with the remaining 20% split equally between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you perform your integrated sequence, pay close attention to the nuances of each movement. During the forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region, and that the head maintains uninterrupted, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you execute the stirs, hip rotations, and leg raises, hone in on the subtle rocking motions produced by your lateral shifts. Here, tracking plays a crucial role. As you perform each stroke, observe her responses in detail—not just how your body feels, but more importantly, which specific movements elicit the most pleasure for her. Tracking is your real-time feedback loop, allowing you to discern exactly which areas of her vaginal canal are responding most positively at that given moment. This is vital because tracking isn’t just about internal cues; it’s about identifying where she loves to be massaged and under what conditions. Once you have that data—say, after 30 or more well-observed repetitions—you enter a state of flow. Flow is when every forward push, every lateral stir, every hip rotation, and every leg raise happens automatically, fluidly, and with consistent, targeted precision. In flow, you’re continuously massaging the areas she finds most pleasurable with the exact pressure and pace that drive cumulative sensation and ultimately, her climax.
Deep, rhythmic breathing is critical throughout this process. Each deep inhale primes your body for the next micro‑movement, and each slow, controlled exhale ensures that your transitions are smooth and effortless. Your tap keystroke drills continue to serve as the foundation for lateral control, guaranteeing that every sideways shift is executed with pinpoint accuracy and adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle. If you notice any inconsistency—perhaps the pressure is slightly off or the pace isn’t quite right—pause, track that feedback, and make a small, mindful adjustment. Over time, these minor tweaks will bring you closer to that perfect state of flow, where your Cacao Stroke is not only scientifically optimized but also irresistibly effective at delivering cumulative, focused pleasure.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to establish your personalized practice routine—a disciplined training regimen designed to reinforce every element of your Cacao Stroke while simultaneously strengthening the core and overall stability essential for your lean ectomorphic frame and moderate extension. Your practice routine is the roadmap that will transform your natural athletic ability into a flawless, repeatable performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically optimized stimulation.
Begin by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are banished, and you can fully focus on honing your technique. Each session begins with a comprehensive warm‑up, tailored specifically for your ectomorphic build. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back; these muscle groups form the foundation of your stability and control. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, activating every muscle and joint for the precise work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and set a clear, positive intention for the training session.
Next, move into specialized drills. Start with the tap keystroke drill: assume your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted, then practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your extension in the moderate range, each lateral shift must be executed with pinpoint precision. Focus on gently shifting your body until your hip lightly taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Synchronize every movement with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale deeply before each lateral shift and exhale slowly as you complete it. Integrate kegeling exercises with each repetition to strengthen your pelvic floor and further sharpen your control. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until these movements become fully ingrained in your muscle memory.
After you’ve mastered the lateral drills, integrate them with the vertical components. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and then a smooth, gradual backward shuttle. Ensure that every part of this integrated sequence adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle—concentrating about 80% of your force on the shallow, sensitive vaginal zone while still engaging the deeper layers in a balanced manner. Drill this complete sequence repeatedly on both sides until each transition feels natural and seamless. To further bolster your stability and precise control, supplement these stroke-specific drills with targeted core-strengthening exercises, such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills. A strong core is essential for maintaining balance and ensuring that every micro‑movement is executed with maximum precision. Finally, keep a detailed training journal—record every session, noting the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you experiment with, and your partner’s feedback. This journal is an integral part of the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to monitor your progress, fine-tune your technique continuously, and ultimately transform your natural ability into a flawless performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—the moment when every drilled component of the Cacao Stroke merges into one seamless, continuous performance. This final module is the culmination of your disciplined practice, where your lean, agile ectomorphic frame and your moderate extension come together in a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core engaged, and your mind sharply tuned to precision. Start with a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides effortlessly over her clitoral region and that the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, focusing about 80% of your force on the shallow, nerve‑rich area, while the remaining 20% is meticulously balanced to also engage the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately, transition into the lateral phase on one side by executing the tap keystroke with your chosen hip. Drop your hip in a small, deliberate lateral movement until it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. As you do this, focus intently on how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. Should any lateral tap feel inconsistent—whether the pressure seems uneven or the angle is slightly off—pause, isolate that movement, and drill it repeatedly until both your internal cues and her subtle feedback confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Next, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position and allows you to gather precise internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, focus intensely on contracting your core and engaging your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for subtle indications from your partner—her steady, deep breathing, or even a soft verbal cue, will tell you if each movement is hitting the mark. If you notice that the cumulative stimulation isn’t quite optimal, make slight, mindful adjustments—tweaking your lateral angle by just a degree or two, or modifying the pace of your forward push—and track the results through the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied that every adjustment has been refined, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as a unified, rhythmic performance. Then mirror the entire cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced, cumulative stimulation throughout the vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you reach that state, your Cacao Stroke will be a continuous, fluid demonstration of your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate finesse—a performance that is scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your dedicated practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every stir, every hip rotation, and every leg raise is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your lean, agile ectomorphic frame and moderate extension will have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic Cacao Stroke that delivers optimal pleasure with every move. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother, and let every flawless cycle of your Cacao Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
