Module 1 for The Ngoma is about getting your body set up in the safest and most efficient way so the stroke can be executed cleanly without strain or confusion. Your foundation begins with the forearm plank, knees resting on the canvas, and hips hovering at a height that allows consistent shallow entry. For an endomorph body type, you must keep your weight spread across the forearms and knees so your lower back doesn’t sag, which would collapse the angle and cost you stamina. The spine should stay long, shoulders stacked over elbows, and hips angled slightly forward so the line of penetration naturally favors the shallow 80% depth zone. With a penis size of five to seven inches, this position lets you maintain full wall clarity without slipping too deep, where leverage might be lost and pressure becomes uneven.
The neutral baseline is the home position you will always return to between keystrokes. Think of it as the reset point where your hips are centered, your shaft aligned on the downward diagonal, and your breath steady. Every lean, grind, or hover must return to this posture before you chain the next action, otherwise fatigue builds in the joints and your rhythm falls apart. Each return should be tied to an inhale, giving you both recovery and stability. Exhale carries the motion out into the wall contact, whether that motion is Angling toward left or right or Rocking through a grind. This breath loop locks your posture into the rhythm while protecting your core.
Depth control is crucial here. For your size, the shallow zone is your anchor. It keeps the head of your penis pressed along the walls where sensation is sharpest for her and ensures your leverage stays sustainable across sets. Mid-zone entry, the 10% allowance, is possible, but only when her cues are clear—like a deeper breath, a pelvic curl, or hips pressing forward. As an endomorph, you need to guard against overusing mid-depth, because the extra body mass can load the spine if you drop your hips too far. Respecting shallow engagement gives you stamina and keeps pressure where it counts.
Joint load must be managed carefully. Spread your weight between knees and forearms, with hands relaxed flat on the canvas. If your belly pulls you downward, actively brace your core to stop the slump and hold the pelvis steady. A sag breaks the penetration line and forces you into deeper zones where the stroke loses its wall clarity. Protecting the wrists and shoulders comes from stacking the joints in line and keeping shoulders retracted slightly so you’re not collapsing into your chest. Each neutral return is a chance to check that alignment is still intact.
The reason this posture is non-negotiable is because it gives you precision. Without neutral plank, the stroke devolves into uncontrolled thrusting, where her cues blur and your endurance drains fast. With it, every wall contact is repeatable, and her feedback becomes obvious. A metaphor to hold in mind: imagine you are a drummer keeping time on a steady hi-hat—if the posture collapses, the beat scatters, but if it holds, the rhythm can build indefinitely. You are the drummer here, keeping the time in your body so her body can ride the music of your stroke.
A journal line after early practice could be as simple as: “Neutral baseline held steady, shallow entry at east diagonal, Medium pressure, hips stayed light, she sighed at rep five.”

====================================================================================




Module 2 for The Ngoma teaches you how to break the stroke down into its building blocks so each keystroke can be trained cleanly before they’re chained together. You begin from the same forearm plank baseline described in Module 1, with your knees set on the canvas, spine long, and hips angled forward enough to keep entry shallow. Every keystroke starts and ends here so your rhythm stays precise and your joints remain protected. For an endomorph with a shaft length of five to seven inches, this neutral return guarantees depth stays consistent, leverage is controlled, and each wall contact is repeatable.
The first keystroke is the leftward lean, an Angling action where you tilt your hips slightly left so the head of your penis shifts to massage the right wall. You should inhale as you prepare, then exhale as the lean carries through, letting pressure rise to Medium so she feels steady contact without jamming. The zone stays shallow at eighty percent, which keeps sensation sharp and protects you from overextending. What she feels is a sweeping stroke across her inner right wall, and the cue to watch for is her hips pressing gently into you or her breath deepening. Reflect by asking yourself if the pressure stayed smooth across the wall or if you dropped into a thrust that pulled you too deep; if so, reset slower and hold the angle instead of driving forward.
The second keystroke is the mirrored rightward lean, the same Angling action in the opposite direction. Here the head shifts to massage her left wall, again anchored at shallow depth. The inhale to prepare and exhale through action gives you rhythm, and Medium pressure is still the ceiling. Endomorph leverage means you must control bodyweight so you don’t collapse into her pelvis, which can blur the wall feel and shorten your stamina. What she feels is an answering sweep along her left side, often leading to a pelvic curl as her body tries to match you. Reflect by noticing if her exhale comes softer here, which means she’s relaxing into the stroke, and slow down your return to neutral so she can ride the sensation fully.
The third keystroke is the grinding sequence, which is a Rocking action where you keep the pelvis pressed against her body and rotate in a slow triangular path. From left to north to south, your shaft draws across the right wall, then the roof, then the floor of her canal. This is still shallow play, with Light-to-Medium pressure depending on lubrication. Each grind should ride one exhale, and then a neutral inhale resets you. With your size, this grinding pattern creates a spread of sensation across three walls without ever risking bottoming out. She will likely still her body or give a low sigh when the roof or floor is hit in sequence, which is a cue to sustain that loop longer. Reflect by checking if the grind stayed smooth or if your hips broke into thrusting; the former sustains arousal, the latter wastes energy.
The fourth keystroke is the vertical hover lift, which combines Rocking and Angling as you shift weight slightly forward and raise your hips just enough for the top shelf of your penis to press at her entrance. The motion stops before withdrawal, creating a hovering pressure that she feels as a pulsing fullness right at the opening. This action uses Light-to-Medium pressure only, tied to a soft exhale, and always followed by a return to baseline with an inhale. With five to seven inches, you must avoid over-lifting, as that risks accidental exit and ruins rhythm. Her likely cue is a small intake of breath or hips rising to meet you, which signals the hover is hitting its mark. Reflect by feeling if your core stayed engaged and your spine long; if you slumped, you’ll lose clarity of the top shelf pressure.
These keystrokes interlock to form the full logic of The Ngoma. Practice begins with the left and right leans until both feel stable, then add the grinding triangular path, and finally bring in the hover lift to complete the cycle. The early focus is on shallow engagement and wall clarity, because once those keystrokes are clean, chaining them becomes natural. Think of it as learning the beats of a drum pattern one at a time before playing the groove. Training each keystroke solo first builds the muscle memory and breath timing that will later allow you to sustain Flow and Pinning without collapse. A simple journal line could read: “Right lean, shallow, Medium pressure, she curled hips, breath held, at rep three.”

====================================================================================




Module 3 for The Ngoma is about taking the isolated keystrokes you already trained and weaving them into a continuous rhythm that feels like one living stroke. This is where the movements stop being separate drills and start forming a loop your body can repeat with clarity and stamina. Think of it like learning drum patterns: each hand hit is simple alone, but together they build a beat that carries momentum.
Begin from your neutral forearm plank, hips supported, spine long, and pelvis angled slightly forward. With your size in the five-to-seven range, the shallow zone at eighty percent is where you’ll spend nearly all of your time, so make every cycle begin and end there. Inhale to center, exhale into action, then inhale back to neutral. This breath rhythm anchors the sequence and keeps your pressure in the Medium band without drifting into force.
The first chain pairs the left and right angling leans. Roll your shaft head along her right wall as you exhale, reset on inhale, then shift into the left wall on the next exhale. This Rocking pendulum teaches you to swing sensations across her channel while never leaving shallow depth. Watch for her hips curling inward or her breath catching; those are signs the pendulum is striking both walls cleanly. Return to neutral after every pair so your hips don’t overcommit forward.
The second chain layers in the grind triad. From neutral, exhale and rotate leftward, brushing the roof, then sweep down toward the floor before inhaling back to baseline. Repeat on the right. This is Angling with rotational flow, spreading stimulation across roof and floor diagonals in one breath cycle. She will often sigh or deepen her exhale when this lands, a signal that the spread is engaging both her upper and lower walls. For you, the key is bracing your core so your weight doesn’t sag and collapse the angle, which is a risk with your endomorphic leverage.
The third chain blends the hover lift with a lean. From shallow baseline, inhale, then lightly lift into the roof with Light pressure as you exhale. Reset to neutral, inhale, then exhale into a left lean, back to neutral, inhale, then exhale into a right lean. This teaches you how to contrast roof hovering with angled wall contact. Her observable cues will be a sharp intake of breath during the hover, then pelvic pressing on the lean if it lands. Always finish back at shallow neutral before repeating, or fatigue will drag you deeper than intended.
Once these three chains are stable, you can construct the full Ngoma loop. Flow from left lean to right lean, into the grind triad, into the hover lift, and then return fully to neutral. This whole loop should ride across at least four steady breaths. Early practice should cap at three to five loops before resting, since your body type can overload joints if you push too far. Journal after each set with one line that tags the loop count and wall coverage, such as: “Ngoma Loop Full@3, walls steady, fatigue at rep four.”
With your endomorphic build, the temptation will be to drive leverage through your hips. Guard against this by staying disciplined with forearm support, keeping the hips slightly back, and letting breath cycle timing set the pace instead of raw force. At your size, staying shallow protects stamina and keeps wall clarity sharp. Overextension will blur the chain and dull her perception of the stroke.

====================================================================================




Module 4 for The Ngoma is about running the SSP loop in the shallow eighty percent so you can track what works, refine it, and build confidence in the stroke before ever pressing deeper. This is the discipline stage where the movements stop being theory and become data-driven. You’re not chasing intensity here; you’re observing how each wall responds and marking it with clarity.
Begin from neutral forearm plank with hips braced and pelvis forward enough to give you control but not enough to collapse into depth. Inhale to set, exhale as you lean into a wall, then inhale back to shallow neutral. Each mini-set is one wall per three to five breaths. For example, spend three breaths working the left wall with Medium pressure, staying only in shallow depth, then pause to reset. Journal one line that marks your wall, pressure, and rep count, such as: “Left wall shallow@3, Medium, hips steady.”
Tracking is about forming small hypotheses and testing them. Define what you expect—for instance, that a right lean with a slower exhale will make her breath deepen—and then run three reps to see if that happens. If she sighs or curls her hips inward, confirm it. If she stays still or stiffens, adjust your angle or pressure. Always return to neutral before shifting sides so your hips don’t slide forward unconsciously.
Your body type as an endomorph means your core will try to dump weight onto your forearms and push you deeper than planned. Guard against this by consciously resetting to baseline after every wall test. Your five-to-seven inch size gives you just enough reach to explore diagonals without threatening depth safety, but only if you remain disciplined in shallow territory. Overcommitting will blur the walls and dull the clarity of your tracking.
The rhythm here should be steady and deliberate. Think of it as laying tracks with a hammer: one strike, pause, reset, next strike. You are building data, not flow. Over time you will see patterns in her observable cues: deepened breath on roof hover, pelvic curl on angled walls, stillness on floor sweeps. Note these without judgment and store them as reference points.
By the end of this module, you should have at least a handful of shorthand journal lines showing what walls respond best under shallow Ngoma testing. These will guide you into the Flow stage with precision.
Ready to proceed to Module 5 for The Ngoma with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


====================================================================================




Module 5 for The Ngoma is where you move from testing into sustaining flow. The goal is to choose the wall or diagonal that gave the clearest cues in tracking and then ride it with steady rhythm. Flow is not about exploring every option—it is about deepening sensation on a proven path. For an endomorph with a five-to-seven inch range, the shallow to mid zone is your sweet spot. It lets you sustain clarity without overloading joints or collapsing into depth.
Start in neutral forearm plank with your hips balanced. Inhale to prepare, exhale as you lean into the chosen wall with Medium pressure, and return to shallow baseline on the inhale. Let the rhythm be steady, like a drummer holding tempo—exhale through the press, inhale through the reset. Once you have the groove, let the return carry less pause so she feels continuity. Flow is built by reducing the gaps between actions without losing the reset that protects your leverage.
In this stage, you keep pressure mostly at Medium, occasionally easing to Light as a check, but never pushing into Hard yet. The shallow eighty percent remains your foundation, with the mid ten percent opening only if her cues are unmistakable. A deepening breath, a pelvic curl toward you, or hips pressing in all mean she is inviting that mid reach. If she stills or tenses, return immediately to shallow. The SSP discipline still applies here—observe, tweak, and test—only now you do it in motion instead of isolated sets.
Your body type makes stamina pacing essential. Carry your weight through the forearms, not the shoulders, and keep your hips floating rather than dropping. With your size, you have enough reach to graze roof and wall diagonals smoothly without risking collapse. If you feel your lower back starting to arch or your wrists taking strain, pause for a breath reset in plank before resuming. Flow must be sustainable or it breaks.
She will feel this phase as steadier pressure and continuity, like a river pressing against one bank rather than a hammer striking once. Look for her body to sync with you—her breath falling into your rhythm, her hips rising as you press, her sound softening or stretching longer. These are signs to keep the groove steady. If she curls or stiffens, adjust angle or lighten pressure but maintain rhythm.
A simple journal line at the end of a session might read: “Right wall shallow-mid@12 reps, Medium pressure, breath sync at rep 7.” These notes become your roadmap for sustaining flow again in the future.

====================================================================================




Module 6 for The Ngoma is about carefully opening the option of mid and deep penetration while still protecting safety and rhythm. You have already built the shallow foundation and learned how to sustain flow; now you test whether her body is ready to accept the extra ten percent in mid and the final ten percent at depth.
Start from neutral plank with your forearms carrying weight and hips stable. Inhale to prepare, then on the exhale lean with a controlled Rocking press toward the chosen wall. Instead of stopping at shallow, glide slightly deeper, letting the shaft enter to mid zone. Keep pressure Medium, never forcing. With five to seven inches, you are able to reach mid comfortably, but you must gate your depth so that the last centimeter is always optional, never automatic. Use breath timing to control this—inhale on the reset, exhale only as far as the wall accepts without resistance.
When she signals readiness, you may test deep entry. These cues are clear: hips pulling you in, a soft moan that drops in tone, her pelvic tilt angling to meet your thrust. If she stiffens, holds her breath, or withdraws, you must stay in mid or return to shallow. Deep ten percent is reserved for moments when her body explicitly asks for it. Your endomorph build gives you natural leverage to drive weight forward, so stay disciplined—use your forearms to carry load, not your lower back. If you collapse, you will lose both safety and clarity.
At depth, keep pressure Light to Medium and never hammer. Think of it like gently placing the head against the south wall of a cave—firm enough to be felt, soft enough to avoid bruising. Hard pressure at deep is never used with your size. Use Flow rhythm to test consistency, but always add pauses for feedback. She should feel filled and grounded, not jolted. If she curls into you, it means depth is safe; if she arches away, retreat.
Your endurance depends on staying relaxed. For an endomorph, hips can tire quickly under load. Reset in plank every ten to twelve reps, inhaling deeply before resuming. Rest is not failure—it is how you protect stamina and clarity. Lubrication checks are vital here, since dry friction at depth can cause pain. Always lighten pressure or pull back to shallow if glide reduces.
A simple journal entry could read: “South wall mid@8 reps, Medium pressure, pelvic curl at rep 5, no invite for deep.” Over time, this record shows you when and how she opens the deep option.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for The Ngoma with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


====================================================================================


Module 7 for The Ngoma focuses on pinning her arousal after orgasm and coaxing multiples with disciplined micro-adjustments. At this point you are no longer chasing depth or range—you are applying precise shifts in angle, pressure, and tempo while holding her in a grounded baseline.
Begin in the neutral forearm plank, weight carried forward so your hips stay free. After she peaks, keep yourself inside her at shallow or mid depth and stay still for a full breath cycle. Her body will often pause, tighten, or soften in that space. Exhale slowly and apply a controlled Rocking micro-press, angled toward the last wall she responded to. Pressure should stay Light to Medium, never rushing. Think of this as holding her on the edge of a wave, not crashing through it.
From here, test micro-angle adjustments. Lean hips a finger-width left or right, exhaling as you shift, watching for cues: a pelvic curl pressing into you, a deeper inhale, or her thighs tightening around you. Each cue is an invitation to add another rep. If she stills or pushes back, hold or retreat to baseline. For a five-to-seven-inch build, you can use shallower rocking more effectively than deep thrusts—this makes each adjustment clear without overwhelming her cervix.
Tempo is critical. Use short bursts of three to four strokes, then pause for a breath cycle. These bursts should explore one compass line at a time. For example, south wall Rocking for three presses, pause, then reset neutral. This stop-start rhythm lets her nervous system reset and re-fire, often sparking the next wave. Avoid continuous pounding; your endomorph frame generates strong force naturally, so discipline matters more than effort.
Her body’s cues will lead the way. A pelvic curl signals you to continue on the same line. A soft exhale suggests release, telling you to lighten pressure. A hip press-in is the green light for firmer strokes. Track these signals with the SSP loop: Observe, tweak angle or pressure, test for three reps, then refine. If her arousal drops, reset neutral and wait one full breath before resuming.
A reflection entry could read: “North wall shallow, Light pressure, pelvic curl at rep 3, second orgasm sparked by pause-reset.” Journaling like this shows which walls and timings consistently ignite multiples.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for The Ngoma with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


====================================================================================






Module 8 for The Ngoma is where you turn the mechanics you’ve built into a full training plan. You now understand the keystrokes, the chaining logic, and the way to manage depth and pressure. This module is about putting it all into a four-week cycle so the stroke becomes instinctive and sustainable under your body type.
Begin by setting your practice sessions in the forearm-plank baseline. For an endomorph frame, the goal is to keep load off the wrists and shoulders while building endurance in the hips and core. Each week, spend dedicated time running the keystrokes in isolation, then chaining them into full Ngoma rhythm. Work in blocks of short cycles—around ten strokes followed by a breath reset. This keeps you from overloading your lower back and preserves stamina across longer sessions. Always reset neutral and let your breathing guide the tempo: inhale to prepare, exhale through the action.
In the first week, stay mostly in the shallow 80% zone and focus on clarity. Practice the left-tilt and right-tilt angling keystrokes until they feel like second nature. Journal what walls respond best, for example: “Shallow right wall, Medium pressure, pelvic curl at rep five.” Use this week to condition your plank posture and train your awareness of cues rather than chasing outcomes.
The second week is about chaining. Run two tilts to one side, return to baseline, then two tilts to the other side, then reset. Add in the grinding cycle at the center—north, then south, then back to neutral. For your size range, the mid-zone is optional, so only touch it when her cues are strong and the lubrication is high. A simple reflection could read: “Two left tilts, grind sequence, partner hips pressed in at mid.”
By the third week, you shift toward Flow. This means linking the entire Ngoma stroke with consistent breath pacing. Start with shallow angling, add the grind cycle, then lift into the vertical pushout before resetting neutral. Flow is where your rhythm becomes smooth and repeatable. Work in sets of three cycles, pause for a breath, then continue. This builds neural pathways so the stroke feels natural even under fatigue.
The final week integrates everything. Practice alternating between Flow and Pinning strategy. After a set of Ngoma cycles, pause inside her and hold the wall she favored. Apply Light Rocking pressure with micro-angles and watch for her cues. This is where you refine the ability to spark multiples. Journal simply, “North wall pin, Light pressure, hips pressed in, second release.”
Rest hygiene is key for your body type. Always give yourself at least one recovery day after two sessions. Your joints and hips carry natural load, so spacing practice ensures sustainable growth. The plan is not about rushing—it’s about building rhythm memory so that in live play, the Ngoma emerges without conscious thought.
