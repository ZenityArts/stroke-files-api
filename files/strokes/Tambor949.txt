Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Tambor Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m honored to guide you through this program designed especially for mesomorphs with an extension between 5 and 7 inches. Your physique is the epitome of balanced strength and athleticism—muscular, defined, and perfectly proportioned—giving you excellent control and endurance. Even though your asset is moderate in length, every inch is remarkably sensitive when harnessed with the proper technique. Today, we are going to channel your raw power into the Tambor Stroke—a dynamic, full‑body technique that combines a deliberate forward push with rapid, precise hip rotations to create cumulative, focused stimulation.
Picture yourself in your personal training space—a quiet, dedicated sanctuary where distractions fade away and your entire focus is on perfecting your art. Feel the firm, supportive floor beneath your feet; it’s as steady as your own mesomorph build. Take several deep, controlled breaths; with each inhale, draw in pure, concentrated energy, and with each exhale, release any tension. This is your arena, brother—a place where your natural potential is refined into a performance that transforms every move into a masterpiece of cumulative pleasure.
We begin by adapting the classic missionary position to suit your mesomorph structure. Start in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface designed to support your powerful frame. This foundational stance anchors your entire body, ensuring that every micro‑movement—from the subtle sway of your hips to the swift, controlled rotations—is executed with deliberate precision. With your balanced, muscular build, every shift must be finely tuned so that your natural power is directed exactly where it yields maximum stimulation without overwhelming sensitive areas.
Once you’re securely anchored, carefully insert your penis at a controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. Think of this deliberate insertion as your blueprint—it sets the exact angles and pressure points that will govern your Tambor Stroke. Your journey begins with a smooth, deliberate forward push. As you drive your body forward toward her head, feel the top shelf of your extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, intentional contact with her “south wall.” Because your asset is in the 5‑7‑inch range, the 80‑10‑10 principle instructs you to direct about 80% of your force onto the shallow, super-sensitive vaginal zone (the first 1 to 3 inches) while evenly distributing the remaining 20% between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This careful, deliberate force allocation lays the foundation for cumulative stimulation.
After the forward push, you enter the signature phase of the Tambor Stroke. Here, you select a directional mode—either “Tambor going right” or “Tambor going left.” In Tambor going right, you execute fast‑paced hip rotations to the right: as you rotate, the hilt rapidly canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head quickly points first toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall. In Tambor going left, the process is mirrored: the hilt canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head starts by pointing toward the southeastern wall and then shifts to the north‑eastern wall. These rapid rotations harness your mesomorph agility so that even at a fast pace, the stimulation remains cumulative and precisely controlled.
This introduction sets the stage, brother. It shows you how to set up your space, adopt the proper posture, and channel your natural mesomorph power and moderate extension into a Tambor Stroke that transforms your raw force into a precisely executed performance of cumulative pleasure. Welcome, brother—today we begin turning your natural potential into a true work of intimate art.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Alright, brother, let’s break down the core technical principles that fuel your Tambor Stroke. This module is where the science behind every movement meets the art of stimulation, ensuring every action you take is purposeful and cumulative.
First off, the 80‑10‑10 principle is your force-distribution blueprint. Imagine this: 80% of your force is concentrated on the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—because this area, with its dense network of nerve endings, is where maximum sensitivity resides. The remaining 20% of your force is evenly divided—10% for the mid‑depth zone (approximately 3 to 5 inches) and 10% for the deep zone (beyond 5 inches). For you, even though you’re a mesomorph with a moderate extension, this principle is essential. It ensures that while your rapid, dynamic movements can reach deeper, your power is primarily channeled into that ultra-sensitive shallow area, building cumulative stimulation without overwhelming any spot.
Next, let’s dive into the Sexual Scientific Process—a systematic method for refining your technique continuously. It starts by clearly defining your goal; perhaps your objective is to maximize the intensity of your fast-paced hip rotations in the Tambor Stroke. With your goal set, you form a hypothesis—maybe you suspect that a slightly faster rotation or a specific angle change will boost cumulative stimulation. Then comes tracking. During tracking, you perform about 30 repetitions for each directional movement, carefully observing your body’s cues (engaging your core, activating your pelvic floor) and, importantly, listening to your partner’s responses—her deep, rhythmic breathing, subtle shifts in posture, and soft verbal cues. This real-time feedback is crucial; it tells you precisely which aspects of your stroke are resonating and where you might need to adjust.
After gathering sufficient data from tracking, you naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that almost magical condition where every micro‑movement—from your forward push to your rapid hip rotations—occurs seamlessly and automatically, as if dancing to a perfect rhythm. In flow, you don’t need to overthink each move; your body instinctively delivers the ideal pressure and timing that tracking has refined, allowing cumulative stimulation to build effortlessly with every repetition.
Lastly, the tap keystroke drill is indispensable for achieving lateral precision. Imagine yourself in a firm forearm plank; then slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, and return smoothly to center. Though it seems simple, this drill builds the muscle memory and pelvic strength required for every lateral motion, ensuring that your rapid movements adhere flawlessly to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Practiced with deep, controlled “stroke breathing” and integrated with kegeling, the tap keystroke drill is a cornerstone of your technique.
So, brother, to summarize: the 80‑10‑10 principle focuses 80% of your force on the ultra-sensitive shallow zone, with the remaining 20% evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep zones; the Sexual Scientific Process—with its clear goal setting, hypothesis formation, tracking, and flow—refines your technique through continuous feedback; and the tap keystroke drill provides the lateral precision essential for cumulative stimulation. With these foundational principles firmly established, you’re ready to break down the Tambor Stroke into its individual components and master each keystroke with scientific precision.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Tambor Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, let’s break down the Tambor Stroke step by step so you have a meticulous, detailed blueprint to follow. The Tambor is performed in the classic missionary position—on top in a modified plank with your knees on the canvas, and your penis inserted at a controlled downward diagonal angle. Once inserted, you have two directional options: operating “Tambor going right” or “Tambor going left.” Each mode uses fast-paced hip rotations to generate rapid, cumulative stimulation.
Start with the foundation: your forward push. From your anchored position, drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head with a smooth, deliberate push. Feel the top shelf of your moderate extension glide gracefully over her clitoral region while the head remains in constant, intentional contact with her “south wall.” Since your extension is within the 5‑7‑inch range, the 80‑10‑10 principle demands that about 80% of your force is directed at the shallow, ultra-sensitive zone (the first 1 to 3 inches), with the remaining force evenly divided between the mid‑depth and deep layers. This establishes the cumulative base for your stroke.
Now for the directional phase. In “Tambor going right,” you execute fast-paced hip rotations to the right. As you rotate, the hilt of your penis applies pressure—canvassing from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening. Simultaneously, the head rapidly points toward the southwestern wall and then shifts to the north‑western wall, delivering dynamic, cumulative stimulation with each rapid turn. Conversely, in “Tambor going left,” the process is mirrored: the hilt canvasses from the north‑western segment to the south‑western segment, while the head initially directs its force toward the southeastern wall before shifting to the north‑eastern wall. These rapid rotations must be performed with both speed and precision, ensuring that the 80‑10‑10 distribution remains intact and every movement adds to the cumulative pleasure.
Training the Tambor Stroke means isolating these keystrokes and drilling them until each becomes second nature. Begin by mastering the forward push—practice it until your movement is smooth, consistent, and controlled. Then isolate the fast-paced hip rotations: first, drill the “going right” rotations—focus on attaining quick rotations in which the hilt canvasses correctly (from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment) and the head shifts precisely (from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall). Next, drill the “going left” rotations, mirroring the same precision. Alternate these drills until you can execute them rapidly while maintaining the integrity of the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Each keystroke—from the forward push to every rapid hip rotation—is critical in building cumulative stimulation. This detailed deconstruction gives you a clear, step-by-step roadmap that transforms your natural ectomorphic agility and moderate extension into a finely choreographed performance that delivers focused, cumulative pleasure.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now it’s time to drill each individual element of your Tambor Stroke until every micro‑movement is executed with flawless speed and precision. With your lean ectomorphic build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you’re built for rapid, agile movements—but every fast-paced rotation must be controlled meticulously. In this module, we isolate each keystroke and drill it repeatedly until it’s fully ingrained in your muscle memory, keeping the 80‑10‑10 principle and the correct hip rotation details in sharp focus.
Begin with the forward push drill. Assume your modified missionary position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that supports your lean frame. Carefully insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle, then slowly execute a forward push toward your partner’s head. Focus on the sensation—feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Since your extension is moderate, channel about 80% of your force to the shallow, ultra‑sensitive area. Drill the forward push slowly and methodically until your movement is perfectly smooth and consistent.
Next, move on to lateral shift drills. Start with a right lateral shift. From your forward push position, slowly shift your entire body to the right in a deliberate, controlled manner. Focus on evenly transferring your weight; feel your hilt apply steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening while your shaft rotates to deliver broad, rhythmic pressure toward her left wall. Incorporate the correct hip rotations by performing 2 slow rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment and the head transitions from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. Drill this right shift repeatedly until it becomes automatic.
Then, practice a left lateral shift drill. Shift your body slowly to the left, ensuring that your hilt applies consistent pressure along the left side while your shaft rotates to project broad pressure toward her right wall. As you execute this shift, perform 2 slow hip rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, and the head moves from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall. Alternate these drills until you can transition seamlessly between right and left shifts, with every movement adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Now, add the “double down” element. On the right side, after a standard right shift, lower your body further in a controlled manner to perform a right double down. Focus on amplifying the pressure—feel your hilt deliver additional force to the right side while your shaft continues its broad, cumulative motion toward her left wall. Drill this double down slowly until you achieve complete control. Then, mirror this movement on the left side—execute a left shift followed by a left double down, ensuring cumulative stimulation is applied evenly. Aim for at least 30 repetitions per drill until every micro‑movement is imprinted in your muscle memory.
Throughout every drill, maintain deep, controlled breathing. Inhale deeply to fuel the next movement, and exhale slowly to ensure smooth transitions. Also, integrate the tap keystroke drill into your routine: from a stable forearm plank, slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the surface, then return to center. This simple exercise refines your lateral precision and ensures every movement adheres flawlessly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Alright, brother, now it’s time to bring all the individual elements together into one continuous, seamless performance—the complete Tambor Stroke in action. Return to your starting position in your modified missionary stance with your knees firmly planted on the canvas, your core engaged, and your entire focus on linking every micro‑movement into an uninterrupted rhythmic cycle. In this integrated sequence, you’ll combine your deliberate forward push with your rapid hip rotations and dynamic lateral shifts to create a stroke that delivers rapid, cumulative stimulation.
Begin with a deliberate forward push. Insert your penis at the controlled downward diagonal angle and slowly drive your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Feel the top shelf of your extension glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push lays the foundation, ensuring that about 80% of your force, according to the 80‑10‑10 principle, is focused on the shallow, sensitive vaginal zone.
Immediately after the forward push, choose your directional mode. For example, if you opt for “Tambor going right,” transition immediately into fast‑paced hip rotations to the right. Execute rapid, controlled rotations—feel the hilt apply pressure as it canvasses from the north‑eastern segment to the south‑eastern segment of her vaginal opening, while the head swiftly moves from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. Conversely, if you choose “Tambor going left,” mirror the process—with the hilt canvassing from the north‑western to the south‑western segment and the head shifting from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall. These rapid movements must maintain the 80‑10‑10 distribution so that the majority of your force is always concentrated on the shallow, ultra‑sensitive area, while the rest adds a balanced depth of stimulation.
Throughout this integrated sequence, keep your deep, rhythmic breathing steady—it serves as your internal metronome, with each inhale fueling your rapid rotations and each exhale smoothing the transitions between the forward push and directional hip rotations. With every complete cycle, your Tambor Stroke evolves into a continuous, fluid performance that transforms your natural mesomorph agility and moderate extension into a carefully choreographed display of rapid, cumulative stimulation.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation and Flow Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome, brother, to the advanced phase where every micro‑movement of your Tambor Stroke is honed to perfection. With your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, every detail is critical—even during those rapid hip rotations. The 80‑10‑10 principle remains your unwavering guide: approximately 80% of your force must hit the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you perform your integrated sequence, focus on the quality and consistency of each move. During your forward push, ensure the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region, with the head maintaining steady, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” When executing your rapid hip rotations—whether operating to the right or left—observe how the hilt and head distribute pressure along her vaginal walls. This is where tracking is critical; each repetition provides immediate, real‑time feedback. Listen carefully for her deep, rhythmic breathing, note any subtle shifts in her posture, and be highly attuned to soft verbal cues that indicate which elements of your stroke are most effective in building cumulative stimulation. Tracking is your immediate feedback loop that allows you to adjust your technique with pinpoint precision.
Once you’ve gathered enough tracking data—ideally around 30 repetitions per directional mode—you’ll naturally enter a state of flow. Flow is that magical condition where every micro‑movement—from your forward push to each rapid hip rotation—occurs seamlessly and automatically, like a perfectly choreographed dance. When you’re in flow, you consistently deliver the exact pressure and timing that your tracking has helped fine-tune, and cumulative stimulation builds effortlessly with each cycle. Deep, controlled breathing remains essential: every deep inhale prepares you for the next move, and every deliberate exhale ensures smooth transitions. If any lateral or rotational movement seems even slightly off, pause, track her feedback, and make small, mindful adjustments until your technique is flawless.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Alright, brother, now it’s time to build your personalized practice routine—a disciplined, structured training program designed to reinforce every aspect of your Tambor Stroke while strengthening your core and overall stability. With your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and an extension between 5 and 7 inches, you possess an ideal blend of power, endurance, and precision. This routine will transform your raw potential into a flawless, repeatable performance that consistently delivers rapid, cumulative stimulation.
Begin by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary free from distractions, where your focus is 100% on honing your technique. Every training session should begin with a thorough warm‑up tailored to your mesomorph body. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—these essential muscle groups form the foundation of your stability and control, ensuring every micro‑movement is executed with perfect precision. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, priming every muscle and joint for the intensive drills ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to clear your mind and establish a determined, positive tone for the session.
Next, move into specialized drills, beginning with the tap keystroke drill. Assume your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface that supports your powerful, balanced frame. Practice controlled lateral taps: slowly shift your body laterally until your hip gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. With your extension between 5 and 7 inches, every lateral movement must be executed with pinpoint accuracy. Synchronize each shift with deep, deliberate breathing—inhaling deeply before each movement and exhaling slowly upon returning. Integrate kegeling exercises with every repetition to further strengthen your pelvic floor and enhance control. Aim for at least 30 precise repetitions per side until the tap keystroke drill becomes second nature.
Once you’ve mastered the tap keystroke, integrate it with your forward push and rapid hip rotation drills. Practice a controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by drills for fast-paced hip rotations in your preferred directional mode (right or left). Focus on executing these rapid rotations with speed and precise control—the hilt must canvas the correct vaginal segment (north‑eastern to south‑eastern for right rotations or north‑western to south‑western for left rotations), and the head must shift accurately (from the southwestern to the north‑western wall for right rotations, or from the southeastern to the north‑eastern wall for left rotations). Drill these combined movements repeatedly until every transition is smooth and your technique consistently adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle. To further enhance stability and precision, supplement your practice with targeted core-strengthening exercises, such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability workouts—your core is the anchor that ensures every movement is executed with maximum precision. Finally, maintain a detailed training journal where you log every session—record the number of repetitions, note any adjustments you experiment with, and capture her feedback. This journal is an indispensable tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to track progress and continuously refine your technique until you reach perfection.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—the pinnacle of your disciplined practice, where every drilled component of your Tambor Stroke converges into one seamless, continuous performance. In this final module, your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and your extension between 5 and 7 inches come together in a rhythmic, cumulative display of intimate mastery that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, unwavering focus. Assume your starting position confidently in your modified plank—with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, your core engaged, and your mind fine-tuned for absolute precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, feel the top shelf of your extension glide effortlessly over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must rigorously follow the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that about 80% of your force is directed at the shallow, ultra‑sensitive vaginal zone, while the remaining 20% is meticulously balanced to stimulate the deeper layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your chosen hip. Slowly shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, then return smoothly to center. Focus intently on the sensation—observe how the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening, and notice how your shaft rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. Integrate the correct hip rotations here: if shifting to the left, perform 2 slow rotations where the hilt canvasses from the north‑western to the south‑western segment, with the head moving from the southeastern wall to the north‑eastern wall; if shifting to the right, execute 2 slow rotations where the hilt moves from the north‑eastern to the south‑eastern segment, with the head transitioning from the southwestern wall to the north‑western wall. If any lateral movement seems off—if the pressure isn’t perfectly balanced or the angle requires a slight tweak—pause, isolate that motion, and drill it until both your internal cues and her subtle feedback confirm perfection.
Then, execute a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you push upward, contract your core and engage your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for her responses—her deep, steady breathing and any soft verbal cues are your indicators. If you sense that the cumulative stimulation isn’t at its peak, make small, mindful adjustments—perhaps tweaking your lateral angle or the pace of your forward push—and meticulously track these refinements using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your adjustments, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps with correct hip rotations, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly in a rhythmic, unified performance. Then, mirror the complete cycle on the opposite side, ensuring that cumulative stimulation is evenly delivered throughout her entire vaginal canal. The ultimate goal is to reach a state of natural flow—a condition where every movement occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When you achieve this state, your Tambor Stroke will have evolved into a continuous, fluid masterpiece—a performance that rigorously adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and consistently delivers the precise, targeted stimulation that drives her to climax.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements will transform your disciplined practice into a true work of intimate art—a performance in which every forward push, every rapid hip rotation, every lateral shift, and every micro-adjustment is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your naturally muscular, well‑balanced mesomorph build and your extension between 5 and 7 inches will be honed into a seamless, rhythmic Tambor Stroke that consistently delivers optimal, scientifically guided pleasure every time. Keep tracking, refining, and evolving your technique, brother—and let every flawless cycle of your Tambor Stroke bring you both closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
