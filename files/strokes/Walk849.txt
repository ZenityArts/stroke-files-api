Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Walk Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m excited to work with you—an endomorph with a penis size between 5 and 7 inches. Your robust, full‑figured build gives you a stable, enduring foundation, while your moderate extension offers you a unique capacity for controlled, cumulative stimulation. Today, we’re not just learning a new stroke; we’re embarking on a process to convert your natural strength and endurance into precise, rhythmic movements that generate intense and balanced pleasure.
First, settle into a quiet space where you won’t be disturbed. Sit or lie down, relax your broad shoulders, and take several deep, steady breaths. Let yourself get completely focused. In the Walk Stroke, you assume the classic missionary position with a few modifications tailored specifically for your endomorphic profile. Start by getting into a modified plank position—knees firmly planted on a stable surface—to support your naturally round, sturdy body. With your penis inserted at a downward diagonal angle, begin by moving your entire body northward, toward your partner’s head. As you do this, visualize the top shelf of your shaft gently massaging her clitoral region, while the head consistently presses against her “south wall.” Because your extension is between 5 and 7 inches, it is essential that your forward movement channels most of your energy (roughly 80%) onto the shallow, highly sensitive vaginal zone, leaving the remaining 20% evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep regions.
After that forward push, we move into the lateral phase. Given your endomorphic build, you have natural strength and endurance, which allow for controlled, deliberate movements. Here, you will raise one hip in a small yet intentional “tap” movement. For example, raise your right hip laterally so that the right side of your shaft applies firm yet measured pressure against the left part of your partner’s vaginal opening, while the left side produces a gentle, rocking massage on her right internal wall. Then, you slowly lower that same hip so that the underbelly of your penis continues to apply firm pressure against her lower wall while the upper shelf maintains solid contact with her upper wall. Importantly, throughout this movement, you maintain continuous contact—your penis never fully withdraws. Instead, you slowly shuttle backward, allowing the head to keep in contact with her north wall throughout the extraction. Once you return to your starting position, you repeat the sequence on the opposite side: raise your left hip laterally, apply the tap, lower the hip, shuttle back—all while preserving the rhythmic “walking” motion of your hips.
Today’s introductory session is all about laying the foundation. Your endomorphic build provides you with extraordinary strength and endurance, but with a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every fraction of movement must be precise to achieve balanced stimulation. We’re going to work on transforming your raw power into deliberate, scientific, and cumulative actions that not only maximize pleasure but do so in a way that suits your unique physique. Welcome, brother—let’s begin channeling your natural assets into a performance of intimate mastery.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding Your Unique Profile and Anatomy
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re going to take an in-depth look at your specific anatomical profile—as an endomorph with a penis size between 5 and 7 inches—and how these characteristics impact your Walk Stroke. Your body is full and robust; you’ve got a broad, sturdy frame that delivers endurance and powerful stability. At the same time, your moderate extension requires every micro‑movement to be executed with precision, since your stimulation zone is naturally more compact.
Visualize your body as a well-oiled, high-powered machine. Your broad chest, thick limbs, and solid core give you the strength to generate controlled, forceful movements. However, because your extension falls between 5 and 7 inches, the area available for stimulation is more focused, meaning the precision of each movement is paramount. Here, the 80‑10‑10 principle is your guiding light: roughly 80% of the stimulation you deliver should concentrate on the shallow zone—the first 1 to 3 inches where nerve endings abound—while the remaining 20% is split equally between the mid‑depth and deep zones. This proportional distribution ensures that the majority of your force is applied where it can achieve the maximum response, without overwhelming the deeper tissues.
Your robust, endomorphic build offers distinct advantages. Your natural mass means you have excellent endurance and stability, which is key for maintaining controlled, deliberate movements over longer periods. However, these same qualities require that you be mindful of how you manage your power. Every time you propel yourself forward or shift laterally, you must be conscious of the force and angle to ensure that the stimulation meets the 80‑10‑10 criteria. Because your penetration range is moderate, this refined control prevents excessive force from being misdirected and ensures that every touch is both effective and comfortable for your partner.
Moreover, incorporating the Sexual Scientific Process into your training is essential. Set clear objectives for each cycle of your stroke—for example, ensuring that the top shelf of your shaft consistently targets the clitoral area—and experiment with slight adjustments in lateral movement or forward drive. Track your partner’s responses—her breathing, physical cues, and verbal feedback—and use this data to fine‑tune your technique. Each iterative adjustment brings you closer to the perfect rhythm where every micro‑movement is optimized for cumulative stimulation. Your body’s natural feedback mechanisms, combined with your robust endurance, allow you to modulate your movements precisely, making each repetition more effective than the last.
By deeply understanding your unique profile as an endomorph with a moderate extension, you lay the groundwork for mastering the Walk Stroke. Your body’s strength is your asset, and with careful, scientific adjustments, you can ensure that every micro‑movement is executed with precision to deliver maximum pleasure. Embrace your anatomy, brother—this deep awareness will guide you as we break down each component of the stroke further in the coming modules.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Walk Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, now it’s time to break down the Walk Stroke into its fundamental components so you can master each element individually before putting it all together into a seamless performance. Picture yourself in the missionary position once again, on top in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. Your endomorphic build and a penis size between 5 and 7 inches mean that every micro‑movement is crucial for balanced stimulation, and we’re going to isolate each phase for focused practice.
We begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle, then move your entire body slowly and deliberately northward toward your partner’s head. In this forward phase, the top shelf of your shaft should glide over her clitoral area, while the head remains in steady contact with her “south wall.” This forward drive is crucial: its primary purpose is to establish the foundation of stimulation by focusing 80% of your force on the shallow, sensitive vaginal zone, with the remaining 20% spread evenly to engage the mid‑depth and deep regions. Because your extension is moderate, each forward push must be executed with control and precision to ensure that every contact point is maximized.
Next, transition into the lateral phase—the heart of the Walk Stroke. From your forward position, initiate a controlled lateral shift by raising your right hip. This small, deliberate “tap” is known as the tap keystroke, a foundational drill designed to train you in precise lateral movement. As your right hip lifts, the right side of your shaft should apply targeted pressure on the left part of her vaginal opening, while the left side creates a gentle, rocking massage against her right internal wall. This lateral tap is repeated three times in succession, ensuring that each tap adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle by maintaining most of your stimulation on the shallow zone. Precision is key here: with a penis between 5 and 7 inches, even small deviations can affect cumulative stimulation.
After completing the lateral taps, lower your raised hip gradually. As you do, feel the underbelly of your penis begin to press gently against her lower wall, while the upper shelf continues to maintain contact with her upper wall. At the same time, slowly shuttle your body backward, ensuring that your penis remains in continuous contact with the north wall as you retract without fully withdrawing. This backward shuttle resets the stroke and prepares you for the next cycle.
Once you return to your starting position, mirror the sequence on the opposite side. Raise your left hip laterally so that the left side of your shaft engages the right part of her vaginal opening, then lower and shuttle backward. This alternating “walking” motion creates a rhythmic, cumulative pattern that evenly stimulates all areas of the vaginal canal.
By deconstructing the Walk Stroke into the forward movement, lateral taps via the tap keystroke, controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttling, you create a clear roadmap for practice. Each component must be executed with exacting adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that your compact extension works efficiently in every phase. This breakdown is your blueprint for transforming raw strength into a finely tuned, cumulative performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, now we’re going to drill each individual component of the Walk Stroke until every movement feels instinctive. With your powerful endomorphic build and penis size between 5 and 7 inches, precision and control are paramount. We’re going to isolate each segment—the forward movement, the lateral tap (the tap keystroke), the controlled hip lowering, and the backward shuttle—so that each micro‑movement is perfected before integrating them into a complete sequence.
Start with the forward movement. Assume your modified plank position with your knees firmly on the canvas. Insert your penis at the prescribed downward diagonal angle and slowly push your body northward toward your partner’s head. Focus intently on the contact points: feel the top shelf of your shaft gently caressing her clitoral region, while the head consistently maintains a firm connection with her south wall. Because your extension is moderate, every forward push must be precise—aim for about 80% of your force to be delivered to the shallow, nerve‑rich zone. Execute this forward drive slowly and deliberately, and repeat it until you can reliably recreate the same gentle, cumulative pressure.
Next, isolate the lateral movement—the tap keystroke. From the forward position, raise your right hip in a small, controlled movement until it lightly taps the supporting surface. As your hip rises, visualize the right side of your shaft applying targeted, measured pressure against the left portion of her vaginal opening, while the left side delivers a smooth, oscillatory rocking massage on her right internal wall. Synchronize every tap with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale as you prepare, exhale as you complete each tap. To reinforce control, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor with each lateral tap. Drill this lateral component for at least 30 slow, precise repetitions on each side until it becomes ingrained in your muscle memory.
After mastering the lateral tap, focus on the lowering phase. Gradually lower your raised hip toward the canvas; as you do, concentrate on how the underbelly of your penis applies gentle pressure to her lower wall, while the upper shelf preserves contact with her upper wall. Finally, practice the backward shuttle—slowly retract your body while maintaining continuous contact with the north wall. Repeat this full sequence—forward drive, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times in succession, ensuring that every movement consistently adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and that the rhythm becomes second nature.
Keep your breathing deep, steady, and synchronized with every motion. Each inhale should fill you with focus, and every exhale should smooth the transitions between movements. With dedicated drilling, your powerful endomorphic frame and moderate extension will meld together into a precise, cumulative performance that forms the foundation for the complete Walk Stroke.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all those drilled components into one continuous, rhythmic performance—the very essence of the Walk Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified plank, with your knees planted firmly, core engaged, and your focus completely on seamless integration. In this module, we’re merging the forward drive, lateral taps (via the tap keystroke), controlled hip lowering, and backward shuttle into one fluid, cumulative cycle.
Begin with the forward movement: insert your penis at the precise downward diagonal and slowly push your entire body north toward your partner’s head. As you do, allow the top shelf of your shaft to continuously massage her clitoral region while the head maintains steady contact with her south wall. This forward push should fully adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that the majority of your force is concentrated on the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase. Execute three controlled lateral taps by raising your right hip in that perfectly precise tap keystroke. With each tap, ensure that the right side of your shaft presses accurately against the left side of her vaginal opening, while the left side produces a consistent, rocking massage on her right internal wall. Once these taps are complete, slowly lower your right hip so that the underbelly of your penis applies a gentle yet effective pressure on her lower wall, and the upper shelf keeps steady contact with her upper wall. Then, slowly shuttle your body backward until you return to your starting position, with your penis remaining in continuous contact with her north wall.
After completing the cycle on the right side, reset and mirror the entire sequence on the left. Raise your left hip laterally and perform three deliberate lateral taps (this time the left side engages the right vaginal opening, while the right side provides that steady rocking touch on her left internal wall), then lower and shuttle backward. This alternating “walking” motion of your hips creates a rhythmic, cumulative pattern that effectively stimulates every region. Throughout this integrated sequence, let your deep, steady breathing be your internal metronome—inhale to prepare, exhale to execute each transition smoothly. With each seamless cycle, your combination of endomorphic power and moderate extension will converge into a naturally flowing performance that is as scientifically precise as it is intimately engaging.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, we focus on fine-tuning every micro‑movement of the Walk Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal, cumulative stimulation. With your robust endomorphic build and a penis size between 5 and 7 inches, it’s essential that every movement is calibrated to honor the 80‑10‑10 principle while perfectly balancing forward momentum, precise lateral taps, and controlled backward shuttling.
As you cycle through your integrated routine, keep in mind that approximately 80% of your applied force must be focused on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, with the remaining 20% split equally between the mid‑depth and deep areas. Pay close attention to your forward drive—ensure that the top shelf of your shaft is consistently providing that gentle yet firm caress on her clitoral region, and that the head maintains deliberate contact with her south wall. Then, as you perform your lateral taps, concentrate on the subtle rocking motion generated by your small hip raises. Even slight modifications in the lateral angle can significantly affect the distribution of pressure—experiment with adjusting your angle by just a degree or two to see how it enhances the rocking effect and overall cumulative stimulation.
This is where the Sexual Scientific Process comes fully into play. Define your objective—perhaps to enhance the consistency of the rocking sensation on a specific vaginal wall. Formulate a hypothesis on how a minor adjustment in your lateral tap might achieve this effect, then track your partner’s responses in real time through her body language, breathing, and any verbal cues. The continuous loop of defining, hypothesizing, tracking, and refining is key to perfection. Your deep, rhythmic breathing remains critical—inhale to activate each controlled movement, and exhale to smooth out transitions, keeping every phase synchronized with the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Over repeated cycles, this rigorous feedback loop will help you enter a state of flow—a place where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle becomes instinctive and automatically executed with impeccable precision. This state of flow is where your powerful endomorphic strength and moderate extension come together, creating a seamless, rhythmic performance that is both scientifically fine-tuned and deeply connected to your partner’s pleasure.
Remember, brother, every tiny adjustment matters. Use your internal cues and your partner’s feedback to continually refine your technique until the Walk Stroke becomes an effortless extension of your own inner rhythm. With consistent tracking and refinement, your performance will evolve into a harmonious, automatic expression of cumulative stimulation that perfectly embodies the principles of controlled force, precise angling, and deliberate rocking.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, let’s build your personalized practice routine—a disciplined training regimen that reinforces every element of the Walk Stroke while strengthening the core and overall stability essential for your robust endomorphic build paired with a penis size between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your roadmap to consistently transforming raw power into a refined, perfectly executed performance that maximizes cumulative stimulation.
Begin by setting up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private area where distractions fade away and every breath and movement is focused solely on your technique. Start each session with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically for your endomorphic frame. Engage in dynamic stretches that target your core, hips, and lower back—the pillars that support your controlled micro‑movements. Visualize each stretch as an activation of your inner engine; feel your muscles loosen and your joints align in preparation for the intricate series of actions required in the Walk Stroke. Take a few deep, steady breaths to center your focus and set a positive tone for the session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target individual components of the stroke. Begin with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position (with your knees firmly planted), practice small, controlled lateral shifts. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so it gently taps the surface, then returning to center. Synchronize each shift with deliberate breathing—inhaling before the tap, exhaling as you complete it. Integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each tap to secure the precise pressure needed. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side, building a firm foundation in lateral control.
Once the lateral movement is well refined, integrate it with vertical components. Practice a slow, controlled forward push towards your partner’s head, then immediately follow with a series of lateral taps and a smooth, gradual backward shuttle. Repeat this complete integrated cycle on each side, always adhering to the 80‑10‑10 distribution. Your goal is to ensure that the majority of your force remains concentrated in the shallow zone while the mid‑depth and deep zones are engaged in a balanced manner.
Supplement these stroke-specific drills with core-strengthening exercises. Incorporate exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills to fortify your core. A strong midsection is essential for maintaining the controlled, deliberate movements of the Walk Stroke and for supporting your robust build. Keep a detailed training journal where you record every session—the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments made, and feedback from your partner’s responses. This journal is vital for employing the Sexual Scientific Process; it allows you to track progress, identify what works best, and refine your technique continuously.
Your personalized practice routine is your blueprint for mastery, brother. With every dedicated session, you transform your natural endomorphic strength and moderate extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically precise, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Walk Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This module is the culmination of your disciplined training, where your robust endomorphic build and penis size between 5 and 7 inches come together in a completely integrated, rhythmic expression of intimacy.
Begin your advanced session by setting up your training space with absolute focus. Assume your starting position confidently—on top in your modified plank, knees securely planted, core fully engaged, and mind tuned exclusively to precision. Start the cycle with a slow, controlled forward movement towards your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your shaft consistently caresses her clitoral region, and that the head maintains deliberate contact with her south wall. This forward phase must adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with the overwhelming majority of your force directed towards the shallow, highly sensitive zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing your tap keystroke with your right hip. Raise your hip in a small, controlled motion and perform three precise lateral taps. With each tap, concentrate on how the right side of your shaft applies consistent pressure to the left portion of her vaginal opening, while the left side delivers a steady, rocking massage to her right internal wall. If any tap appears inconsistent or the force distribution deviates from the ideal, pause and isolate that movement. Drill it until your internal sensations and her responsive cues confirm that everything is perfectly balanced according to the 80‑10‑10 distribution.
Then, move into a controlled vertical pushout—slowly extending your body upward until the head of your penis resets completely in position. Use this moment of extension to gather feedback: listen closely to the contractions in your core and pelvic floor and observe any subtle responses from your partner. Use this iterative refinement—defining your goal, hypothesizing small adjustments, tracking the outcomes, and then fine‑tuning your technique—as the essence of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’ve adjusted, integrate the entire cycle repeatedly until every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle flows seamlessly in a state of automatic precision. Mirror the sequence on the opposite side to ensure balanced, comprehensive stimulation throughout. Celebrate this advanced integration—when every micro‑adjustment becomes instinctive, and your Walk Stroke flows effortlessly as a continuous, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Happy training, brother. Your journey toward transforming your robust endomorphic power and moderate extension into a flawless, scientifically optimized performance continues with every refined repetition of the Walk Stroke. Stay disciplined, keep tracking, and let every perfectly executed step move you closer to intimate mastery.
