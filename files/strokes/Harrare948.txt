Module 1 for The Harrare is about getting the body into the right setup so every movement is clean, safe, and repeatable. The posture you use in forearm plank is the frame that lets each keystroke hit the wall clearly, and for a mesomorph with a below-five-inch shaft this foundation is even more important because depth is limited and angle precision is your advantage. Set your forearms flat, elbows under shoulders, and spine straight from crown to heel. Keep the core engaged but not locked; think of the plank as a stable table rather than a stiff board. This keeps joint load even across wrists, shoulders, and hips and prevents strain from bending the lower back. If you collapse here, every keystroke you try later will blur or jam because the shaft won’t find the right compass line.
From this plank, you must always define your neutral baseline. Neutral is where hips are square, shaft centered, depth shallow at the eighty percent zone, and breath calm. Every keystroke will start here and return here. Without this reset, you drift, and with drift the stroke loses clarity. Treat each baseline like clicking “reset” on a compass before choosing the next direction. The metaphor is a painter rinsing his brush; each reset clears the stroke so the next mark is crisp. For you as a mesomorph, the baseline protects stamina because your balanced frame can deliver many cycles without collapse as long as you keep the spine neutral and core aligned. With a shorter shaft, this shallow baseline keeps you in the wall zone rather than overshooting or bottoming out.
Breath anchors are what give pressure its shape. Inhale in neutral to gather, exhale as you move into any hip drop or sweep. Exhale allows the action to soften through tension rather than jam through force. For a below-five-inch length, pressure must stay Light to Medium in the shallow zone because clarity is more powerful than weight. If you press too hard, you slip past the walls and lose the sensation advantage. She will show you if it is landing correctly: her breath deepens, her hips press in, or her pelvic curl rises slightly. If she stiffens or pulls back, you know the angle or pressure is wrong. The SSP loop starts here with Observe—watch, then adjust before committing to harder cycles.
The safety rules for orientation are simple but absolute. Do not let the lower back sag or ribs flare, or you will load the lumbar spine instead of hips. Keep shoulders down, not shrugged toward the ears. A mesomorph can usually hold plank longer without fatigue, but you must still set rest windows; every twenty to thirty cycles, pause and reset your posture. This protects joints and lets you recalibrate angle before the next sequence. Your penis length means shallow strokes are your main field, so depth gating is clear: stay in the eighty percent zone, enter mid-ten only if her cues open you, and never press for the deep ten unless conditions allow and she is signaling comfort. Journal entries at this stage are about orientation, such as: “Neutral plank baseline, shallow depth, inhale to load, exhale to drop hip, Medium pressure held clear.”
This orientation is your anchor for the entire Harrare. It makes every keystroke legible, every pressure repeatable, and every adjustment traceable. If you respect this baseline, you protect your body, read her signals more clearly, and make the stroke a tool you can trust rather than a gamble.

Module 2 for The Harrare is about breaking down the keystrokes that make up the stroke so you can train each one as a building block. Each keystroke is a distinct hip action performed from the same forearm-plank baseline, and together they create the rhythm logic of the Harrare. For you as a mesomorph with a below-five-inch shaft, these keystrokes must be clean and precise because your advantage comes from wall clarity and angle sharpness rather than deep pressure.
The first keystroke is the left hip drop. From neutral plank, inhale to prepare and exhale as you let the left hip sink toward the canvas. This is a Rocking action that angles the shaft downward and across, pressing into the right wall at the shallow eighty percent zone. Pressure stays Light to Medium, because with your shorter length the goal is clarity at the wall rather than force. She will likely show a deeper breath or slight pelvic curl if this contact is sharp and clear. Reset to baseline after the exhale to avoid drifting off-axis.
The second keystroke is the right hip follow-through. After the left hip has dropped, allow the right hip to lower as well, joining the left. This creates a diagonal sweep across her canal from the right wall to the north wall. This is an Angling motion combined with Rocking, best used in Flow rhythm once trained. For a mesomorph body type the stable core makes this sweep smooth, but with a shorter shaft the key is to keep pressure Medium and not overextend depth—staying in shallow or, if she opens, brushing mid. Her cue will be stillness or a soft exhale if the sweep lands. Return to baseline cleanly before repeating.
The third keystroke is the right hip lift. Inhale at baseline, exhale as you raise the right hip while the left hip remains low. This reverses the shaft angle, sweeping from the north wall back to the right wall. This is primarily Rocking with a subtle Angling component, and it is most useful in Tracking or Flow depending on tempo. For a shorter shaft this keystroke delivers a clear side-to-side press without bottoming out, and you should watch for her hips pressing inward if it lands. Keep pressure Light, as the angle alone creates intensity. Reset fully to neutral plank to avoid bias toward one side.
The fourth keystroke is the lift back to full neutral. Both hips rise together, carrying the shaft from the right wall toward the south wall and back to starting point. This restores the downward diagonal entry and reestablishes plank posture. This keystroke is the anchor, the baseline reset, and should always be performed with Light pressure and calm exhale. It serves Tracking best, preparing the loop for the next cycle. With your body type, stamina is preserved by always using this neutral lift rather than rushing back into the next drop.
The mirror sequence repeats on the opposite side with the right hip drop leading into the left hip follow-through, then left hip lift, and reset. Each action mirrors the previous pattern, creating balance and symmetry in training. The cues to watch are the same—breath deepening, hips pulling in, or pelvic curl—but because your shaft is below five inches you should guard against overreaching depth during the follow-through sweeps. Clarity comes from the shallow angles, not deep pushes.
A sample journal entry at this stage could read, “Left hip drop, shallow, Light pressure, exhale steady, pelvic curl at rep three.” This confirms the wall hit, the pressure, and the partner cue, making it easier to refine. The keystrokes must each be trained until baseline entry and exit feel automatic. Only then will chaining them into the full Harrare be smooth and consistent.

Module 4 for The Harrare takes you into the Tracking phase, where the goal is not flow but careful observation. Think of it as scouting the terrain—staying shallow at eighty percent depth while testing each wall with mini-sets of your keystrokes. The shallow zone is where sensitivity is highest, and because your shaft length is below five inches, this is the range that gives you the most control and the most reliable cues from her body. You’re not trying to impress here. You’re learning how each sweep across right, north, and left walls lands in her canal and how your mesomorph frame can deliver clarity without strain.
Begin from neutral plank and pick one wall, such as the right. Inhale to prepare, exhale into the left hip drop that presses into her right wall, then reset. Run three to five cycles, steady, Light to Medium pressure, and notice what happens in her body. Does her breath deepen? Do her hips press back? Do you feel her pelvic curl as if she’s meeting the pressure? These are the cues you’re hunting for. Journal a single line after the set—something like, “Right wall shallow, Medium, pelvic curl at rep three.” Then switch to the opposite wall with the mirror keystroke. Keep each set short, resetting to plank fully to avoid fatigue and to protect your hips and shoulders.
Once you’ve sampled both side walls, bring the sweep across the north wall into play. This will feel like a diagonal massage, and here clarity depends on your hip lift being crisp, not rushed. With your shorter length, you may find the north sweep feels more subtle to her. Watch carefully if her breath shifts or her stillness holds longer—that often means she’s registering it more deeply than her words would show. Note this in your journal with tags like, “North sweep, shallow, Light, stillness at rep four.” Keep pressure no more than Medium, never forcing depth, because clarity and stamina outweigh brute drive at this stage.
The SSP loop is simple here: define which wall you’re testing, hypothesize how she might respond, track for cues across three to five reps, then refine by adjusting angle, depth, or tempo slightly. If you sense nothing, don’t press harder. Change your angle by a finger-width or soften pressure. For you, the big adjustment is making each sweep distinct—shorter shafts don’t allow blurred overlaps, so precision is the gift. Treat each wall as its own target and learn how her body speaks back to you when you hit it right.
This phase is not about rhythm but about mapping. Think of it like tuning an instrument string by string before playing the song. Each wall needs its own tuning check. By the end of a session, you should have three or four journal lines that tell you which walls lit her up and which required adjustment. That is enough. You’re laying down a foundation for Flow, where rhythm will take over. Keep your body aligned, shoulders stacked, hips stable between sets, and let breath guide the timing. If fatigue builds, take a twenty-second pause in neutral plank, shaking out your shoulders, then return clean.

====================================================================================================


Module 5 for The Harrare is about entering Flow and sustaining it on the walls you identified during Tracking. You are no longer scouting; you are weaving. Flow is the phase where rhythm takes over and her body begins to ride the pattern instead of only reacting. With a mesomorph frame and a shaft below five inches, your strength is steadiness and clarity, not reach. The way you keep her lit is by staying in the shallow eighty percent and building a groove that never blurs.
Start by selecting the wall that gave you the strongest cues in Tracking. If her breath deepened most on the right wall, build your Flow there first. Drop your hip on the inhale, exhale into the wall with Medium pressure, then return cleanly to baseline on the inhale. Do not rush the reset; the pause is part of the music. Let her register the consistency of the sweep. After five or six reps, you will feel her body start to sync with you—hips pressing back in time, a pelvic curl holding longer, or a subtle stillness that says she wants you to keep that rhythm. This is when you know Flow has taken hold.
Once the first wall is steady, you can expand into a two-wall pattern. Sweep from right into north, then back into right, always resetting with breath. Think of this as drawing a shallow arc across her canal, not pushing deep but painting the wall’s edge with precision. At this length, clarity is your superpower; each sweep should feel distinct to her. If you blur into multiple walls, the effect weakens. Medium pressure is the ceiling here. Hard pressure will not add intensity with your size—it will only shorten stamina and dull her response. Keep your weight spread evenly in plank so your shoulders and hips don’t fatigue too soon.
If mid-zone access feels available—she is lubricated, relaxed, and opening into the sweep—you can let your hip drop a touch further, entering the ten percent mid zone for a few cycles. With shorter length, this may mean only a half-inch deeper, but the contrast will feel big to her. Always enter mid on an exhale, and return shallow on an inhale. Watch closely for her cues: if her hips follow you, if her breath catches, or if she goes still and heavy, you’re in the pocket. If she shifts away or tightens, return shallow immediately. Flow depends on her body trusting your pattern, so protect that trust with precision.
A single journal line after a Flow set might read: “Right wall Flow, shallow with Medium, steady breath, hips pressed back at rep six.” That shorthand reminds you which wall and pressure carried her most. Over time, these notes build your map of how Flow works best with her. Your job is not to improvise wildly but to sustain what her body already told you works.

====================================================================================================


Module 6 for The Harrare focuses on carefully testing whether you can expand Flow into the mid or deep ten percent zones. This is never automatic—it depends on her lubrication, her trust, and how her body has responded to your shallow work so far. With a mesomorph frame and a shaft below five inches, the goal here is not brute penetration but clarity and contrast. Even a slight increase in depth feels big to her if it is deliberate and controlled.
Begin in your established Flow on the shallow wall that has been strongest. Keep your breath anchored—inhale as you prepare, exhale as you sweep. On the next cycle, let your hip angle drop a hair further, no more than the space of a fingertip. This slight change shifts you into the mid zone, about ten percent deeper. Because of your size, the difference will not come from length but from the new contact point along her wall. It should feel like painting just below the line you have already been tracing. She will often react with a deeper breath, a pelvic curl pressing up, or a stillness that says “stay.” If she arches away or breath shortens sharply, return to shallow immediately.
Pressure should remain Medium in this phase. Hard pressure is wasted with your length and will risk tiring your hips and shoulders. What amplifies her pleasure is not force but the steadiness of the compass contact. Think of it as pressing a thumb into the exact groove of her palm—you don’t need to push hard, you just need to be in the right spot. Stay in mid only for three to five cycles before returning shallow. This contrast is what lights her body: shallow safety, a brief deep accent, then shallow again.
Cervix safety is crucial here. Even though your length is shorter, angled entries during Rocking can bring you closer than you realize. Keep the angle downward and controlled, never driving north at full tilt. If you feel sudden resistance or she flinches, that is a wall telling you to retreat. Flow deep work is about whispering into that space, not crashing into it. With your body type, the risk is less about hitting cervix and more about burning stamina by overloading your frame, so keep your weight balanced in plank, forearms steady, hips moving as a single unit.
A journal line might read: “North wall, mid test at rep three, Medium pressure, pelvic curl confirmed, back shallow at rep five.” This keeps a clear record of what worked and how long you held it. Over time, you will build a pattern where shallow Flow is the base and mid pulses are accents, keeping her body awake and surprised without strain on you.

====================================================================================================


Module 7 for The Harrare is where you learn to pin her after orgasm and shape her body into repeat waves. The goal here is not to drive hard or fast but to notice how tiny adjustments in angle, pressure, or tempo can keep her arousal alive and push it back toward another peak. With a mesomorph build and a shaft below five inches, your advantage is control—you can make every contact point count without overwhelming her cervix or draining your stamina.
Start from the neutral plank and settle into shallow Flow. Once she reaches climax, resist the urge to pull out or collapse. Stay steady in plank and soften your hips so the motion is barely more than a rocking sway. This is your baseline pin. On the next breath, shift your hip angle just a fraction—drop your left hip slightly toward the canvas, exhaling as you let your shaft sweep right into the canal’s north corner. Hold it there for two to three cycles, Light pressure, then return baseline. Watch her cues: if she exhales sharply and goes still, that corner is sparking again. If her hips draw up or she curls toward you, keep feeding that angle. If her breath shortens or body pulls back, reset shallow and soften.
From baseline, you can test the opposite corner. Lower the right hip and sweep left into the north again. Because of your size, these shifts aren’t about depth but about catching a new ridge of sensation along her wall. Each sweep should stay in the shallow eighty percent, with pressure no higher than Medium. Think of it like turning a key slightly in a lock—you’re searching for the point where it clicks her open again. Never stay too long on one angle; three to five cycles before returning to shallow baseline keeps her from dulling to the stimulus.
Tempo is another tool in pinning. After orgasm, her nerves are raw. Slow sweeps with exhale through each cycle often bring more return than rushing. If she relaxes into you with a sigh, you can nudge tempo up slightly, but always be ready to dial back. Your frame should stay strong through forearms, shoulders, and core—do not sag hips or let your back arch, as that will drain stamina and blur your compass clarity. Pinning requires endurance of stillness more than bursts of energy. Protect your joints by keeping elbows stacked under shoulders and engaging core to support your plank.
A journal note might read: “North-east corner, shallow, Light pressure, held for three cycles, hips pressed in on second, back to baseline at five.” This one line captures the SSP loop of observe, tweak, and test. Over time, you’ll learn which corners reignite her most consistently and which require only a brush before moving on. The power of Module 7 is knowing you can hold her there, teasing the next crest without losing control of your frame.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for The Harrare with Body Type Mesomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches?


====================================================================================================


Module 8 for The Harrare brings everything together into a clear four-week training plan that lets you build skill layer by layer without overloading your body or dulling her responses. The focus is on weaving posture, keystroke clarity, compass awareness, and recovery into a sustainable rhythm you can practice alone and bring to her later with precision.
Begin each session by grounding in neutral plank for a few breaths, feeling the weight settle evenly through forearms and shoulders. Your mesomorph build gives you strength to hold the posture, but you must guard against tightening your lower back. Keep hips level and spine long, like a straight line from crown to tailbone. Because your shaft is below five inches, the practice emphasis is on shallow control and clean angling rather than depth, so never chase penetration force. Think of every stroke as training a musician’s finger work—small, exact, repeatable.
In the first week, dedicate sessions to single keystrokes only. Pick one compass wall per practice and commit to it for short sets of five to ten cycles, with exhale through the stroke and inhale as you return to baseline. This teaches your nervous system how each keystroke feels in your own body and how her cues show up at that angle. Protect stamina by resting every twenty cycles; set down to knees, roll shoulders, and reset wrists before re-entering plank. Journaling each set in a single line keeps progress tight and measurable.
In the second week, begin chaining two keystrokes together, always resetting at neutral before moving on. For example, train left-hip drop into right-hip sweep, return to baseline, breathe, then repeat. This is where rhythm logic begins to form. As your control sharpens, you will notice how much she reacts not just to the pressure itself but to the confidence of the return—the clean baseline tells her body you are in command.
By the third week, work short Flow phases of twenty to thirty seconds, linking three or more keystrokes and holding a steady breath rhythm. Stay in the shallow eighty percent zone, using Light to Medium pressure as your default. With your body type, stamina is supported by muscle balance, but avoid over-tightening your core, as that will shorten your sets. This phase is about letting the body run the sequence without overthinking, while still journaling one or two observations per session.
The fourth week introduces the beginnings of Pinning logic. After a Flow burst, hold one keystroke at a favored wall for a handful of breaths, noticing how the stillness and slight angle change her response. Then reset, rest, and return. This keeps your practice realistic for her arousal pattern while keeping your joints safe from fatigue. By week’s end, you will have trained both breadth—the whole rhythm—and depth—the ability to hold and tease.
A journal entry from this phase might read: “North wall sweep chained to south return, shallow, Medium, hips pressed in on third cycle, reset after five.” This tells you exactly where, how, and when, and is all you need to refine in the next session. Over time, the accumulation of these short notes becomes a map of your personal mastery.
The training plan is not about exhausting yourself but sharpening clarity, repetition, and recovery so you arrive at her body able to execute without strain. Your compact length allows you to focus precision where others rely on depth, and your mesomorph strength gives you stamina as long as you honor rest breaks. The legend of The Harrare is not built on force but on control, and this plan builds exactly that.
