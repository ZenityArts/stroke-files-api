Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m thrilled to work with you—a mesomorph built with balanced strength, agility, and power, and blessed with an extension above 7 inches. Your body, naturally honed with muscular definition and a perfect blend of speed and control, is ideally suited for dynamic, rhythmic movements that deliver cumulative stimulation. Today, we’re going to transform your raw athleticism into a well‑orchestrated performance that marries scientific precision with intimate artistry.
Imagine stepping into your training space—a quiet sanctuary where you can focus completely without distractions. Take a moment to relax your strong, defined shoulders and breathe deeply, letting go of tension as you prepare to channel your power. In our session today, we’re modifying the traditional missionary position to best showcase your mesomorph frame. Begin in a modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a solid, supportive surface. This foundational stance anchors your entire body, ensuring that every micro‑movement is executed with deliberate control and unwavering precision. Once you are stable, insert your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. This exact insertion angle becomes the blueprint for every movement that follows.
Your first move is a smooth, measured forward push. As you slowly move your entire body forward—heading north toward your partner’s head—the top shelf of your extended asset glides gracefully over her clitoral region while the head stays in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because you have an extension above 7 inches, it is crucial that you concentrate most of your force on the shallow vaginal zone, where sensitivity reigns. We accomplish this using the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring that about 80% of your applied force is focused on the first 1 to 3 inches, while the remaining 20% is split evenly between the mid‑depth and deep zones. This precise force distribution maximizes stimulation exactly where it matters most.
After the forward push, you enter the lateral phase—here’s where your natural mesomorph agility and strength come to the fore. You begin by slowly lowering your left hip toward the canvas. In doing so, the hilt of your penis applies steady, controlled pressure along the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening, and your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, creating friction and a gentle rocking massage along her right wall. Then, you raise your left hip back to center in a smooth, deliberate motion, resetting the pressure before immediately mirroring the same sequence on the right side. This dual‑phase (or “douplo”) process ensures that both sides of the vaginal canal receive balanced, cumulative stimulation in a rhythmic “W” pattern that is both powerful and precise. This introduction sets the stage for transforming your natural mesomorph strength and extended reach into a scientifically refined, cumulative performance that delivers intense, targeted stimulation with every move.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke In this module, we’re diving deep into the key principles that form the technical backbone of your training. It’s imperative that you understand these elements so that every movement in the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke is executed with flawless precision and cumulative effect.
First, the 80‑10‑10 principle. This is your guide to force distribution during stimulation. It tells you that about 80% of your applied force should be directed to the shallow vaginal zone—the first 1 to 3 inches from the entrance—where most of the nerve endings are located, making it the most sensitive area. The remaining 20% of your force is divided equally, giving 10% each to the mid‑depth (approximately 3–5 inches) and deep (beyond 5 inches) zones. For you, with an extended asset above 7 inches, this rule is critical. While your length allows you to reach deeper, the majority of stimulation must be concentrated in the shallow zone to create powerful, cumulative pleasure.
Next is the Sexual Scientific Process—a methodical, iterative approach that turns practice into progress. First, you clearly define your goal; you might decide that you want to maximize friction along the lateral walls during your hip drops, for example. Then, based on initial practice and feedback, you form a hypothesis about slight adjustments that might enhance the stimulation—perhaps altering the pace or angle of your lateral drop. Once you have a hypothesis, you track your performance by performing a high number of repetitions (ideally around 30 per vaginal “wall”), carefully noting both how your body feels (such as core engagement and pelvic floor activation) and your partner’s responses (her breathing, subtle movements, or verbal cues). When you’ve determined the optimal variation, you enter a state of flow—a rhythmic, automatic sequence where every micro‑movement connects seamlessly, and the 80‑10‑10 distribution is maintained effortlessly.
Tracking is simply the mindful gathering of feedback. It involves being acutely aware of every detail—how steady your forward push feels, whether your lateral drops produce the desired rocking effect, and how your partner’s body responds. By converting these subjective experiences into objective observations, tracking becomes the foundation for refining your technique.
Flow, on the other hand, is that state of perfect, unbroken rhythm where everything happens automatically. It’s the moment when you no longer have to think about each movement, because your practice has ingrained the precise pattern into your muscle memory. In flow, the 80‑10‑10 principle is naturally and consistently observed.
Lastly, we have the tap keystroke—an essential drill for perfecting your lateral control. In this exercise, you start in a steady position, such as a forearm plank, and shift laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface before returning smoothly to center. This minimal, controlled movement builds muscle memory and strengthens your pelvic floor, especially when it’s paired with deep, deliberate breathing (also known as stroke breathing) and kegeling exercises. Mastery of the tap keystroke ensures that every lateral movement during your stroke is executed with impeccable precision, which is absolutely necessary for cumulative, focused stimulation.
Taken together, these principles—the 80‑10‑10 force distribution, the structured Sexual Scientific Process with tracking and flow, and the mastery of the tap keystroke—form the technical foundation of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. With these concepts firmly in mind, you’re now ready to deconstruct the stroke into its fundamental components.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components Alright, brother, let’s break down the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into its core building blocks so you can master each segment before integrating them into a seamless performance. Remember, this stroke is dual-phased: first, you complete a full sequence on the left side; then you mirror the exact same sequence on the right side. As a mesomorph with an extension between 5 and 7 inches, your balanced, athletic frame allows you to deliver precise, dynamic movements, while your moderate extension means every micro‑movement must be carefully controlled to target that sensitive area.
Let’s start with the left side. First, you insert your penis at a precisely controlled downward diagonal angle, then execute a smooth forward push. As you move forward, the top shelf of your extension glides softly over her clitoral region, and the head of your penis maintains consistent, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” In this phase, about 80% of your force is focused on stimulating the shallow vaginal zone, as dictated by the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring the sensitive area receives the lion’s share of stimulation.
Immediately following the forward push, you enter the lateral phase on the left. Slowly and deliberately, you drop your left hip toward the canvas. As your hip lowers, the hilt of your penis applies targeted, steady pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right—producing friction and a gentle, upward rocking massage along her right wall. This action is executed using the tap keystroke, which guarantees that the movement is small and controlled, keeping the majority of your force in the shallow zone.
Once the lateral drop is completed, you smoothly raise your left hip back to center. This controlled raise shifts the applied pressure from the left side to a centered focus—the hilt now applies force from the western section upward to the northern section, while your penis reorients to point directly north, delivering a gentle upward massage from the northern wall toward the eastern wall. This integration is key to maintaining a rhythmic, cumulative flow.
You repeat the left‑side sequence several times—perhaps even incorporating variations in pace, such as a faster half-raise before a full drop—to dynamically modulate the friction and pressure. These controlled variations form a rhythmic “W” pattern on the left side that ensures every cycle adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with the majority of your force maintaining focus on the shallow zone.
After fully executing the left‑side sequence, you mirror the entire process on the right side. You begin again with a forward push—identical to the left‑side movement—to ensure that the top shelf glides over her clitoral region and the head stays in constant contact with her “south wall.” Then, initiate the right‑side lateral phase by slowly dropping your right hip. In this mirrored movement, the hilt applies consistent pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so its inner surface points to the left, generating a gentle rocking massage along her left wall. Immediately, raise your right hip back to center in a controlled manner, thereby resetting the cycle. Repeating this sequence builds balanced cumulative stimulation on both sides of the vaginal canal.
This detailed deconstruction of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke—left‑side sequence followed by right‑side mirror—is your roadmap for achieving a balanced, scientifically optimized performance that stays true to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Every micro‑movement is calibrated to ensure maximum stimulation of the shallow, most sensitive area while still engaging the deeper layers in a cumulative, rhythmic pattern.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention Now, brother, let’s drill each component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural and automatic as your own breath. With your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, precision and consistency are absolutely essential. In this module, we’ll focus on repetitive practice of each phase—the forward push, the lateral tap using the tap keystroke (first on the left side, then on the right), followed by controlled hip raising and the backward shuttle. Every repetition must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle so that your moderate extension effectively concentrates stimulation in the shallow zone.
Start by assuming your modified plank position with your knees firmly planted on a stable, supportive surface. Insert your penis at the carefully calibrated downward diagonal angle, and then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, focus on the sensation: feel the top shelf of your extension glide over her clitoral region and keep the head in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Since your extension is moderate in length, about 80% of your force should be directed to that shallow zone. Drill this forward push slowly and deliberately until each repetition is executed with smooth, controlled precision.
Next, drill the left‑side lateral tap using the tap keystroke. From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a small, controlled lateral movement until your hip gently taps the supporting surface. Visualize the hilt applying targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right—delivering a gentle rocking massage along her right wall. Synchronize each lateral tap with deep, controlled breathing: inhale deeply before you start the drop, and exhale slowly as you complete the tap. Incorporate kegeling during each tap to further refine your control. Repeat this left‑side tap drill for at least 30 deliberate repetitions until the movement becomes ingrained in your muscle memory.
Now, mirror this drill on the right side. From your forward position, carefully drop your right hip until it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to center. Visualize the hilt applying steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates to point to the left—producing a rhythmic rocking massage along her left wall. Synchronize this movement with deliberate breathing and integrate kegeling for added precision. Repeat for at least 30 repetitions until it is fully automatic.
Then, focus on the hip lowering and backward shuttle. After each lateral tap, slowly lower the dropped hip until it gently contacts the supporting surface. Feel your penis’s underbelly apply cumulative, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf stays in consistent contact with her upper wall. Finally, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle, retracting your body in a controlled manner so that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall as you reset without fully withdrawing. Repeat this complete sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times on both sides until every transition is seamless and every micro‑movement adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout your drilling, maintain deep, deliberate breathing. Each deep inhale should focus your mind and prime your body for the next precise movement, and each controlled exhale ensures smooth transitions between phases. With disciplined, consistent practice, your athletic mesomorph precision and balanced extension will merge into a series of flawlessly executed, cumulative movements that become second nature.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, fluid performance—the true art of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke. Return to your starting position in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your focus entirely on creating a fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this module, you will merge your forward push, left‑side lateral taps (executed via the tap keystroke), controlled left‑side hip raises, and the backward shuttle into one unified rhythmic cycle. Then, you will mirror that same sequence on the right side to complete the dual‑phase “W” pattern that defines the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke.
Start by initiating a forward push. Insert your penis at the ideal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward—moving steadily northward toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extension consistently glides over her clitoral region and that the head stays in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push lays the foundation for cumulative stimulation and must rigorously adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle by focusing about 80% of your force on the shallow zone.
Immediately, transition into the lateral phase on the left side. Execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip using the tap keystroke. As you perform each tap, focus intently on the sensation: feel the hilt delivering targeted, consistent pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, thus creating a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along her right wall. Once those left‑side taps are complete, smoothly raise your left hip back to center, resetting the pressure, then execute a deliberate backward shuttle that resets your position while ensuring your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall.
Without delay, mirror this sequence on the right side. From your starting position, perform a forward push (maintaining the same 80‑10‑10 force distribution) and then execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your right hip until it gently taps the surface. In this mirrored movement, the hilt applies steady pressure along the right side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the left, delivering a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along her left wall. After completing these right‑side taps, raise your right hip back to center and execute a controlled backward shuttle to reset your position.
This alternating “walking” motion—left‑side sequence followed by right‑side mirrored sequence—creates a rhythmic “W” pattern that distributes cumulative stimulation evenly across the entire vaginal canal. Every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle is executed in accordance with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated performance, let your deep, rhythmic breathing serve as your internal metronome. With every deep inhale, you prepare your body for the next movement, and with every controlled exhale, you ensure smooth transitions between phases. With every complete cycle, your athletic mesomorph precision and balanced extension come together in a continuous, fluid Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke that is both scientifically refined and intimately satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our focus is on fine‑tuning every micro‑adjustment of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal, cumulative stimulation. With your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, each micro‑movement must be executed with precise control in line with the 80‑10‑10 principle. Approximately 80% of your force must be concentrated on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone, with the remaining 20% evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep layers.
As you cycle through your integrated sequence, pay close attention to every nuance. During the forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides smoothly over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you execute your lateral taps using the tap keystroke on both sides, observe the subtle rocking motions produced by your carefully controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even the slightest variation in your lateral drop angle or pace can significantly alter cumulative stimulation. Experiment with minor adjustments—perhaps a one or two degree change in your hip drop or a slight modification in the speed of your push—and meticulously note how these variations affect the overall pressure and rocking effect. Use your partner’s feedback—her deep, rhythmic breathing, soft verbal cues, and subtle body movements—as essential data points for refining your technique.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout each cycle. Each deep inhale focuses your energy and prepares your body for the next micro‑movement, while every controlled exhale ensures seamless transitions. Over time, as you consistently track your internal sensations (such as core engagement and pelvic floor contractions) alongside your partner’s responses, you will reach a state of natural flow—where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity. When this state of flow is achieved, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will be a continuous, rhythmic expression of optimized cumulative stimulation, perfectly aligned with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Every tiny adjustment matters, brother. Your athletic mesomorph frame and moderate extension provide the ideal foundation for delivering intensely focused stimulation—provided that each micro‑movement is executed with consistency and precision. Continuously track your internal cues and your partner’s subtle feedback, and refine your technique until your stroke evolves into a naturally flowing performance that is both scientifically precise and intimately satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core Now, brother, it’s time to create your personalized practice routine—a disciplined training regimen designed specifically to reinforce every element of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke while strengthening your core and overall stability, which are absolutely vital for your athletic mesomorph build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your comprehensive roadmap for transforming your natural, well‑balanced power into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically optimized stimulation.
First, set up your dedicated training space—a quiet, private sanctuary where distractions are banished, and your focus is 100% on mastering your technique. Each training session should begin with an extensive warm‑up tailored specifically to your mesomorph physique. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back, as these muscle groups provide the critical support needed to execute every precise movement in the stroke. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the detailed work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for your training.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target each component of the stroke. Begin with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees securely planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your extension between 5 and 7 inches, each lateral movement must be performed with pinpoint accuracy. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface before returning smoothly to center. Synchronize these movements with deep, deliberate breathing—inhale deeply before initiating each shift and exhale slowly upon completion. To further enhance your precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each tap. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the movement becomes fully ingrained.
Once you’ve honed your lateral drills, integrate them with the vertical components. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head, immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and then a smooth, gradual backward shuttle—all while strictly adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle. Drill this full integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition flows naturally. To further boost your stability and control, supplement your stroke-specific drills with targeted core strengthening exercises—such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills—that are essential for maintaining balance and precise control. Finally, keep a detailed training journal where you record every session: document the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you experiment with, and your partner’s feedback. This journal is an indispensable part of the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to monitor progress and continuously refine your technique.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural mesomorph strength and balanced extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and profoundly satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements Finally, brother, we reach the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of your disciplined practice, where your athletic mesomorph build and your moderate extension come together into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface, core engaged, and your mind entirely tuned to precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extension glides effortlessly over her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward push must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with approximately 80% of your force directed to the shallow, sensitive zone, while the remaining force is carefully balanced to engage both the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately, transition into the lateral phase on one side by executing the tap keystroke with your right (or left) hip. Drop your hip in a small, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps, ensuring that the hilt applies targeted, consistent pressure along that side of her vaginal opening and that your penis rotates so that its inner surface delivers a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage along the opposite wall. If any lateral tap seems off—whether through uneven pressure or a misaligned angle—pause, isolate that movement, and drill it repeatedly until your internal feedback and your partner’s subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Then, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather accurate internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, focus on contracting your core and engaging your pelvic floor, and listen carefully for any subtle indicators from your partner, such as her steady, deep breathing or soft verbal affirmations. This troubleshooting phase is critical; if you notice that the cumulative stimulation isn’t optimal, make slight adjustments—perhaps a minor tweak in your lateral angle or a subtle change in the pace of your forward push—and meticulously track the outcomes using the Sexual Scientific Process.
Once you’re satisfied with your refinements, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as one unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the entire cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation throughout. Achieving a state of natural flow—where each movement occurs automatically with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you reach that state, your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke will stand as a testament to your disciplined practice, technical mastery, and intimate finesse—a continuous, fluid performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply satisfying.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated training into a true art form—a performance in which every forward push, every lateral tap, and every backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and balanced stimulation. Your natural mesomorph strength and balanced extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure with every move. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Douplo Bata Coxa Stroke bring you ever closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
