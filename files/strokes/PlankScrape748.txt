Module 1 of the Plank Scrape teaches how to establish a stable, aligned forearm-plank posture that keeps leverage, balance, and depth precision under full control. Begin by positioning your body on the canvas with knees slightly apart, toes relaxed, and forearms grounded directly under your shoulders. The line from crown to tailbone should form a smooth slope, with the pelvis hovering just high enough to let the penis angle downward toward her south wall. For an Ectomorph, whose long limbs and light frame can cause swayback or shoulder dip, the key is even distribution—press gently through both forearms to stabilize without tension, and draw the navel slightly upward to support the lower spine. The posture should feel suspended, not heavy. Breathe in to lengthen your spine; breathe out to settle into stillness, feeling your weight balanced between arms and knees.
Neutral baseline here means everything is quiet. There is no forward thrust, no pelvic roll, no lean—just the awareness of alignment and gravity. The penis should point naturally at a downward diagonal so that even a Light pressure maintains contact with her lower canal. For a penis below five inches, this shallow baseline keeps the glans anchored rather than slipping out during motion. Inhale and let the body lift microscopically as though decompressing the joints; exhale and allow the pelvis to hang from the spine’s center line. Think of it as balancing a broom handle upright in your palm: the aim is effortless stillness, not stiffness. This state of quiet alignment sets the foundation for all Rocking and Angling to come.
Once you feel stable, explore micro Rocking. On the exhale, shift the pelvis forward by one inch, and on the inhale, return to center. Keep pressure Light and movement small—no more than a finger’s width. The goal is to sense when the head of the penis brushes her entrance smoothly and when friction increases. This Rocking wakes up wall awareness and teaches how to maintain the shallow 80% zone without overshooting. For an Ectomorph, this also trains endurance through controlled muscular tone rather than weight. Watch her cues: a longer breath or hips softly pressing inward mean the connection is clean. If she exhales sharply or tightens, ease the angle and return to baseline.
Next, add gentle Angling to each Rocking phase. Let one hip sink slightly as the other rises, keeping shoulders level. When the left hip dips, the penis leans right and grazes her right wall; when the right hip dips, it presses left. These tiny leans prepare your body for the full Plank Scrape later, where vertical lift and lean combine into friction. For an Ectomorph, keep the lean compact to protect shoulder joints. Below five inches, this precision keeps the shaft fully seated even at light depth. Inhale to center, exhale through the lean, inhale to reset. The pattern becomes a slow wave through your body—balanced, rhythmic, patient.
Keep your breath steady throughout every repetition. Inhale to gather control, exhale to guide movement, inhale to recover. The breath acts as both rhythm anchor and pressure regulator. Each exhale sends subtle energy forward or downward; each inhale reclaims alignment. With practice, this breathing rhythm syncs with her nervous system—the sound of her breath deepening or her hips curling toward you signals your pacing is correct.
End each practice by releasing the plank into a kneeling rest, sitting back on your heels and shaking out the wrists. Journal the posture and sensation in one line: “Neutral plank, shallow 80%, Light pressure, hips steady through eight breaths.” This reflection locks in what proper alignment feels like and creates a baseline for comparison in later modules. Over time, these recorded cues sharpen your proprioception and make every motion in the stroke feel predictable and smooth.
The purpose of this module is to teach you how to build your plank position for the Plank Scrape stroke, protecting your joints while finding a stable angle that gives you full control of depth and rhythm.
Start by coming down into a forearm plank. Place your elbows directly under your shoulders, forearms flat, hands relaxed, and fingers pointing straight ahead. Your chest should hover just above her hips, keeping a soft triangle of space between your torso and hers. Let your pelvis hang low enough to feel a mild stretch across your abdomen, but not so low that your lower back caves. For an ectomorph, your long limbs mean you must be precise about leverage—keep your elbows tucked in tight and your knees slightly bent to absorb pressure without overloading the shoulders. Below five inches in length means your full contact must come from angle and wall tracing, not from thrust depth. Keep that in mind as your primary safety rule.
Breathe in to set your base, feeling your ribs expand against your abs. Exhale slowly and tighten your core just enough to lift your body weight slightly off your pelvis. This creates a floating suspension effect. From here, practice small Rocking motions—forward and back an inch at most—while maintaining the same forearm plank shape. The scrape sensation will eventually come from this Rocking rhythm combined with a shallow 80% entry depth. Think of it like dragging a coin’s edge along a smooth table: steady, even, and controlled by the whole arm, not by thrusting.
Stay in the shallow zone for now. Your below-average length keeps the deep 10% restricted until your rhythm precision is perfect. What she feels here is texture, not impact—the steady glide of your shaft tracing along the anterior wall at light to medium pressure. You’ll breathe in as you rock back and exhale through each forward glide, keeping your abs drawn in so your motion feels guided, not driven. Your goal is to make the pressure feel continuous and confident, never erratic.
When fatigue sets in—usually around the twentieth cycle—drop your knees gently to the bed and reset in neutral. Shake out your wrists and shoulders, roll your neck, and breathe deeply before returning to plank. For an ectomorph frame, rest hygiene is critical; small stabilizing muscles fatigue faster under static load. Reset every minute to maintain precision and avoid collapse.
Your internal focus is clarity of wall sensation. Feel the line of contact along the anterior wall with every glide. Don’t chase speed. Each repetition is a conversation between angle, breath, and resistance. As your awareness sharpens, you’ll begin to sense small differences in wall tone—the kind of feedback that becomes your navigation system later.
Finish the session by lying flat, breathing through the abdomen, and reflecting. Journal in shorthand what you noticed, like this: “Anterior/Light/80% → Rock@20.” That line tells you which wall, what pressure, what depth, and how many Rocking reps you completed. Over time, those entries become your map of improvement.

====================================================================================
This module teaches you the keystrokes that build the Plank Scrape stroke. Each one is a separate body movement that you’ll later chain together into a full rhythm. Think of them like letters in an alphabet—you learn to shape them clearly before writing a full word.
The first keystroke is the Forward Rock. From your forearm plank baseline, inhale through the nose and engage your abs. As you exhale, push gently from the toes so your hips glide forward about an inch. Keep your chest low and your spine straight. The movement feels like shifting your whole torso across a single, invisible rail. This Rocking quality means pressure builds gradually at the anterior wall—right under her pelvic arch. Because your length is below five inches, stay shallow at 80% depth to keep that gliding friction alive without bottoming out. Apply light to medium pressure. For ectomorphs, the long lever arms make this motion smooth but tiring, so perform ten slow reps, then reset in neutral plank and breathe before repeating.
The second keystroke is the Pullback Scrape. This one uses Angling instead of Rocking. Keep your hips slightly lower than your chest and tilt them back toward your heels as you inhale. The underside of your shaft drags lightly along her anterior wall on the exit. Think of scraping frosting from a bowl—steady, curved, clean. Stay in the shallow zone again, no deeper than 80%, using light pressure and exhaling through the motion. This is where texture becomes communication; what she feels is the fine-grained trace of your underside catching along sensitive folds.
The third keystroke is the Anchor Reset. It’s your neutral checkpoint between Rocking and Angling motions. Return to a centered plank, hips aligned, spine neutral, forearms still. Inhale fully and let the pressure ease off completely. For an ectomorph, this prevents muscle strain and recharges precision. Use these neutral beats every five to six cycles to maintain accuracy.
Now add one more keystroke, the Diagonal Glide. Start in neutral, shift your hips slightly toward your left forearm, then rock forward on a diagonal toward her right hip. This finds a fresh angle of the anterior wall—think northwest to southeast on the compass. The Rocking motion crosses the wall differently, pulling new nerve maps into play. Keep this at shallow depth with medium pressure, exhaling through the push. Repeat on the opposite diagonal to complete the compass sweep.
Across all these keystrokes, remember your frame: Ectomorph means long reach, low weight load, quick fatigue. Rest every twenty cycles. Below five inches means wall detail matters more than penetration depth. Always prioritize precision over force. Keep lubrication consistent so scraping stays smooth, not abrasive.
As you master each keystroke, you’re building muscle memory for wall awareness. The way she reacts—hips pressing back, breath pausing, subtle stillness—tells you which motion lands best. Record your results in one shorthand line like this: “Anterior/NW-SE/Med@20.” That tells you the wall, diagonal, pressure, and reps for that set.

====================================================================================
This module shows you how to build the full Plank Scrape stroke by chaining the keystrokes you just learned into a single, fluid rhythm. Your goal is to blend Rocking, Angling, and diagonal pressure into one continuous conversation with the anterior wall, always under control, always guided by breath.
Begin in your neutral forearm plank. Your elbows sit under your shoulders, chest hovering above her pelvis, spine long and steady. Inhale and firm your abs. On the exhale, glide forward using the Forward Rock—a slow, one-inch push from the toes that carries your body as a unit. Let the contact land softly against the anterior wall. Pause there for half a breath to feel the wall’s tone, then begin your Pullback Scrape by shifting the hips back and down slightly, exhaling through the drag. Keep your pressure light to medium. This single forward-and-back sequence is one full scrape cycle.
Now begin chaining. From your neutral Anchor Reset, glide forward again, but this time add a Diagonal Glide. Let your hips track slightly left as you move forward, then return to center on the pullback. On the next cycle, shift slightly right. This alternation recruits the full compass—north, northwest, northeast, each creating a slightly different wall sensation. You’re teaching your body to read wall feedback like Braille, not through force, but through variation. Stay in the shallow 80% zone throughout. Your length makes these lateral and diagonal variations more valuable than depth.
Breath keeps the rhythm honest. Inhale as you pull back, exhale as you glide forward. The exhale should be steady, not forced—think of pushing warmth into the space between you. Every four to five cycles, take a full breath in neutral plank to reset your posture and prevent shoulder fatigue. For ectomorph frames, rest hygiene is non-negotiable. Overextension kills sensitivity. The goal is accuracy, not endurance.
She feels this as a smooth, continuous texture—never stabbing or jerky. When your Rocking and Angling balance is right, her hips will shift forward slightly, her breath will catch, and her pelvic tilt will deepen. Those are confirmation cues that the stroke’s rhythm and wall contact are aligned. If she goes still, it means the glide pressure is perfect—don’t rush; sustain that stillness a few seconds longer.
Internally, you should feel the movement coming from your core, not your arms or glutes. Your abs should pulse softly with each Rocking cycle, your spine unmoving, your breath slow and deliberate. When the cycle begins to feel automatic, you’ve entered rhythm fluency. That’s when the Plank Scrape becomes a single mechanical loop, not separate moves.
End the set by dropping to your knees and breathing deeply through your stomach, keeping awareness on the anterior wall line you traced. Journal in shorthand what you found: “Anterior/NW-SE/Light@40 → Flow Felt.” This note marks the transition from mechanical chaining to intuitive flow.

====================================================================================
This module brings you into the Tracking Phase for the Plank Scrape, where you use the SSP loop—Define, Hypothesize, Track, Refine—to build precision inside the shallow 80% zone. Your focus now is not power, but awareness. You are teaching your nervous system to notice small differences in pressure, texture, and partner response while maintaining stability in plank form.
Start in your forearm plank baseline. Inhale fully, tighten your abs slightly, and exhale into a steady Forward Rock. Define your wall target—the anterior line that runs from her pubic arch to her midpoint. That’s the zone where your shallow glide will live. Hypothesize what type of contact she prefers: a lighter, textured drag or a firmer, flatter press. For now, begin light. Each scrape should feel like the underside of your shaft tracing a slow, even path across that same corridor, guided by the Rocking motion from the toes.
Run a mini set of ten cycles. Track what you feel through the underside of your shaft. Note any points where the texture tightens or where her hips change shape under you. Those are feedback markers. If she pulls in, your angle or pressure is correct. If she tilts away or breath quickens unevenly, pressure is too firm or rhythm too sharp. Pause, reset to Anchor, and adjust. The ectomorph advantage is precision through control—use your long lever arms to fine-tune angles while keeping pressure low.
Move to diagonal glides next. Keep depth shallow and switch between northwest and northeast directions every five cycles. Hypothesize which side gives more consistent resistance. Track her reactions with your breath: exhale forward, inhale back. If one diagonal feels smoother or elicits a stronger hip return, that’s your primary wall for this stroke. Mark it mentally. That’s where your future Flow Phase will anchor.
Always stay under medium pressure. Below five inches means every millimeter counts—wall awareness replaces depth as your main tool of impact. Avoid chasing sensation; instead, refine. Each small adjustment—slightly more Rocking, slightly less Angling—teaches you what line of contact sustains the glide without slipping off.
Between mini sets, drop to your knees and breathe. Rest hygiene protects your joints and resets sensitivity. Think of each reset as clearing the instrument before you play the next phrase. After three or four mini sets, stop and reflect. Which wall direction gave the best reaction? Which pressure made her still? Those data points are your hypothesis for next time.
Journal your results in shorthand: “Anterior/NW/Light@40 → HipCurl.” That entry captures the compass, pressure, rep count, and observable cue. Over time, those notations become your roadmap of what truly works for your anatomy and her response.

====================================================================================
This module guides you into the Flow Phase for the Plank Scrape. The purpose here is to sustain motion without mechanical thinking—to let your nervous system and breath run the rhythm while you keep awareness anchored in feel. You’ll stay in the shallow 80% and occasionally test the mid 10% only if her cues invite it. Flow is not faster; it’s smoother.
Start in forearm plank, spine straight, elbows under shoulders, hips level. Inhale deeply, exhale as you begin your Forward Rock. Let your motion roll from the toes through the pelvis, your body gliding as one solid line. The contact should feel like a steady hum along her anterior wall. The Plank Scrape’s power comes from the evenness of texture—the underside of your shaft pressing and dragging without interruption. Once the glide feels continuous, move into your diagonal alternations, left and right, every few breaths. The alternation keeps nerve engagement fresh and prevents numbing.
Breathe in rhythm: inhale back, exhale forward. Time your exhale so the forward glide finishes at the end of the breath. This timing keeps your abs engaged and your pressure stable. The pressure band stays between Light and Medium. At this stage, her reactions should feel rhythmic too—pelvic curls, small exhales, hips lifting subtly to meet you. Those are green lights to maintain the tempo. If she holds still and breathes slower, you’ve found her body’s receptive zone—stay there. Flow thrives in repetition, not escalation.
For ectomorphs, control fatigue by cycling through three or four continuous minutes, then rest on your knees for thirty seconds. Keep your arms parallel and forearms planted; avoid shoulder collapse. Flow depends on frame integrity. The less your upper body wobbles, the more her wall sensations stay consistent. The rhythm should feel like water running over stone—soft but persistent. That’s your one metaphor for this module.
Because your length is below five inches, depth is your constraint but precision is your advantage. Keep your glides shallow enough that the entire shaft stays in motion; don’t let the head bottom out. Each cycle should cover the anterior wall with uniform contact, giving her the feeling of fullness through consistency rather than reach. Adjust your angle slightly if the friction thins out—one or two degrees of hip tilt restores pressure without force.
End each Flow segment by slowing down rather than stopping. Pull back to neutral plank, breathe deeply, and feel the residual warmth in your abdomen and lower spine. That lingering hum means you maintained continuity. Journal your Flow notes in one clean line: “Anterior/NW-SE/Light@180 → Stillness Felt.”

====================================================================================
This module introduces the deep option for the Plank Scrape, teaching you how to explore the mid and deep 10% zones safely and intentionally. The goal is to expand your range without losing wall contact or control. Because you’re working with an ectomorph frame and below five inches in length, depth must never mean force—it means precision and breath-led pressure.
Start from your neutral forearm plank, elbows stacked under shoulders, hips aligned with spine. Inhale deeply, and on your exhale, glide forward into your usual shallow scrape. After a few smooth cycles, add a slow hip drop at the end of the exhale. This drop should come from your abs relaxing downward, not from pushing with your legs. The head of your shaft will reach slightly deeper, brushing the mid 10%. That’s all you need. Pause there, feel her breath change, then inhale and pull back to neutral. This small drop is the deep keystroke.
As you continue, alternate shallow and mid-depth cycles: two shallow, one deeper. Keep your breath pacing the motion. Exhale into the drop, inhale as you rise. The deep cycle’s pressure should stay Medium, never Hard. Depth exaggerates sensation on both sides, so reduce force proportionally. Think of depth like entering a pool—you don’t dive, you wade until the pressure equalizes. That’s your single metaphor.
For ectomorphs, maintain tight abdominal control so your frame doesn’t sag. Dropping hips too far risks shoulder fatigue or lumbar strain. Keep your forearms pressing evenly into the surface and your gaze slightly forward to hold the spine’s integrity. Shallow-to-mid alternations let you experience new contact layers on her anterior wall—the lower curve, the edge of the cervix zone—but you must never bottom out. Stop any instant you feel resistance beyond a soft cushion; that’s her cervix. Depth work is about surfing that threshold, not crossing it.
She’ll show you permission through small signals: a long exhale, hips curling up toward you, or her body staying perfectly still in deep contact. If she tenses, lifts her pelvis away, or holds breath, retreat to shallow 80% and reestablish rhythm. Deep exploration only works when her nervous system remains open. The Plank Scrape’s deep option exists to massage new textures, not to push limits.
Finish your deep practice by returning fully to shallow motion for a few cycles, letting your breath normalize. Feel how the anterior wall now feels warmer, looser, more reactive. Journal one line to capture your progress: “Anterior/Mid@Medium → HipCurl Held.” Over time, that note tells you when her mid-zone opens predictably and when to include it in Flow.

====================================================================================
This module guides you into the Pinning Phase of the Plank Scrape, where you learn to sustain pleasure after the first orgasm through small, precise adjustments. The SSP loop shifts now to Observe, Tweak, and Test. Instead of broad rhythm, you use micro-angle and tempo control to reignite her nerve response while maintaining your plank discipline. The mission is to extend intensity through awareness, not pressure.
Begin in your forearm plank baseline. After her first wave, hold still and breathe. Let your shaft stay inside, softening slightly. This pause is your reset point. Inhale to regain control of your abs and spine; exhale slowly to keep your frame steady. The ectomorph advantage here is lightness—your body can hover above her without collapsing weight. Observe her cues: breathing, pulse at the hips, slight internal pulsing. Those tell you how open she remains.
From that still point, start a subtle Rocking motion forward and back no more than an inch. Keep it shallow—80% zone only. Your goal is to stroke her anterior wall with minimal friction, letting nerve endings reawaken. If she exhales deeply or curls her hips upward, she’s ready for more. Tweak your angle by a few degrees left or right to refresh texture. Each small shift changes the drag line of the shaft’s underside, giving her a new sensation without breaking rhythm.
When she stabilizes in pleasure again, begin micro-cycles: two short strokes, one long, all under Light to Medium pressure. Inhale through the shorter strokes, exhale through the longer. The alternation keeps her body guessing and prevents overstimulation shutdown. Think of it as feathering a flame—not too close to burn, not too far to fade. That’s your single metaphor.
For ectomorphs, maintain stability through your shoulders and forearms. Because your lever arms are long, small movements at the hips magnify at the shaft tip; precision is key. Below five inches gives you another benefit—your shorter range keeps you inside the most sensitive region without losing alignment. Use that to your advantage: she will feel continuous connection rather than in-and-out loss.
Between bursts, freeze completely for one breath cycle. Let the stillness amplify the lingering pulse. Then test—start again with a slightly slower tempo or a slight angle change. Watch for stillness, breath lengthening, or subtle pelvic curls; those mean you’ve reignited her nerve loops. Each time you find that combination, you’ve pinned her arousal without breaking form.
End your session by resting in neutral plank and breathing deeply. Let your heart rate settle before withdrawing. Journal one line to capture the winning configuration: “Anterior/NW@Light → BreathHeld+Curl.” That shorthand records what combination reactivated her fastest, becoming your future reentry key.
