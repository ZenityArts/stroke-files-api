Module 1 for The Harrare is about building orientation, body setup, and posture discipline so the stroke can be trained safely and with clarity. The focus is on anchoring the forearm plank, managing load as an Endomorph, and creating a baseline that allows the above-7-inch length to be used with precision instead of strain.
Begin by lowering into a forearm plank with knees resting on the canvas. The shoulders stack directly over the elbows, wrists relaxed forward, chest lowered but not collapsed. For the Endomorph frame, the key is distributing weight through forearms and thighs so that the hips do not sag and the lower back does not bear extra load. This alignment protects joints while creating a stable platform where the pelvis can articulate without the whole body collapsing. Imagine the body as a bridge—firm in its beams but with hips as the movable hinge.
From this base, neutral must always be reclaimed before each movement chain. The penis sets on a downward diagonal with the tip guided shallow into the canal, not pushing deep. With above-7-inch length, this diagonal must be disciplined: keep most passes in the shallow 80%, brushing walls instead of driving into the cervix. The temptation is to let weight drop forward, but the safeguard is always an inhale to prepare, exhale as the hips begin the keystroke, then another inhale to reclaim baseline. Each reset gives the spine and shoulders a reprieve and keeps the stroke distinct rather than blurring into thrusts.
When hips first drop into either side, the Endomorph’s mass will magnify pressure. To counter this, consciously grade pressure down to Medium at most, even if the body naturally wants to lean heavy. What she feels at baseline is clarity: the head of the penis pressing into a wall rather than a blunt shove forward. Her cues will tell the truth—if her breath deepens, if her hips press up into the angle, you are aligned. If she stiffens, pulls back, or stills completely, it means range has crossed too deep or pressure has gone past her ceiling. That’s the feedback loop that makes posture and depth control more important than force.
Breath anchors become the rhythm’s guardrails. Inhale as neutral plank is reclaimed, exhale into each keystroke action, and hold awareness in the belly. For the Endomorph, this keeps the diaphragm engaged and prevents energy leaks from collapsing posture. Think of it like loading a spring: each inhale loads the system, each exhale releases force into the angle with control.
Journaling begins now even in posture work. A single clear line like, “Neutral plank, shallow diagonal, Medium pressure, hips steady through five breaths,” sets a baseline marker. These notes track stamina as much as wall contact and become a logbook of control rather than brute effort.
By the close of Module 1, orientation is not about building the figure-eight yet but about creating the plank posture, the breathing rhythm, and the depth discipline that make The Harrare safe and precise. Once this posture is instinctive, the keystrokes can be added without risking joint collapse or depth overrun.

Module 2 for The Harrare now shifts into the keystroke breakdown, turning posture into motion by isolating the building blocks of the stroke. Each keystroke must be trained as its own skill, returned to baseline, and repeated until it becomes distinct in the body. Only then can they be chained into rhythm without collapse.
The first keystroke is the left hip drop. From neutral plank, inhale to steady, then exhale as the left hip lowers toward the canvas. This is a Rocking motion that angles the penis head rightward into her canal. With length above seven inches, only the shallow 80% should be explored here, brushing along the right wall without letting the tip surge into mid-depth. For the Endomorph, the body mass naturally exaggerates pressure, so consciously grade it to Medium or even Light. What she feels is a pressure line sweeping the right wall; if her hips press into it or she exhales softly, it signals the depth and pressure are tuned. Reset with an inhale, hips back to neutral.
The second keystroke is the right hip follow-through. As the right hip joins the left near the canvas, the shaft sweeps left across her canal, tracing toward the north wall. This combines Rocking and Angling: the diagonal tilt plus the sweep. Depth must remain shallow with brief mid brushes only if she leans in. With an Endomorph frame, joint protection is vital—shoulders stacked over elbows, no torso sag. She feels this as a broad sweep across the top wall; cues of stillness or a held breath mean pressure should ease. Reset neutral before reloading.
The third keystroke is the right hip lift. From the lowered position, inhale to prepare, then exhale as the right hip rises while the left hip stays close to the canvas. This causes the penis to sweep back rightward from the north wall to the right wall. It is primarily Rocking, with diagonal angling toward east. The action should stay in the shallow 80%, with Medium pressure at most, because length above seven inches can easily graze cervix if unchecked. What she feels is a shift back across the canal, and her pelvic curl or thigh press is a green light. Reset into plank and inhale to steady.
The fourth keystroke completes the cycle by lifting the left hip back to baseline while the penis glides between her right wall and south wall. This restores the downward diagonal entry. It is Rocking with a southward angle, shallow entry, and Light-to-Medium pressure. She feels the sweep as a curve into her lower wall, and her exhale or hips tipping in are the cue it lands well. Neutral plank follows, locking posture before any repeat.
The mirrored half begins with the right hip drop. From neutral, inhale, then exhale as the right hip lowers, angling the penis head left into her canal. Rocking dominates here, brushing the left wall shallow. Endomorph leverage must stay light; Medium pressure ceiling. She feels it as left wall contact, and her hips will often shift to meet it if tuned right. Reset neutral.
Next is the left hip join. As the left hip drops to meet the right, the shaft sweeps right across her canal toward the north wall. Rocking and Angling combine, creating a diagonal sweep at shallow depth. She feels this as broad roof contact. Watch for deepening breath or hips pressing up. Reset neutral, inhale to reload.
The penultimate keystroke is the left hip lift while the right hip stays low. This sweeps left from the north wall back to the left wall. It’s a Rocking motion emphasizing east-to-west control. Shallow 80% must dominate with only brief mid brushes, as above-7-inch length can overload otherwise. She feels the lateral slide; her stilling or breath catch means ease off. Return to neutral, inhale to steady.
The final keystroke is the full lift of hips back to baseline, guiding the penis between the left wall and south wall to its downward diagonal reset. Rocking and Angling converge here, shallow depth, Light-to-Medium pressure. She feels a lower canal stroke; cues of hips tilting up or a sigh confirm alignment. Reset fully.
The training path is to isolate the hip drops first—left then right—until they can be executed without shoulder sag or depth overrun. Once drops are clean, add the follow-through joins and lifts, chaining them into paired sweeps. Each segment should return to neutral with conscious inhale before linking. This progression builds stroke clarity and stamina protection, giving the Endomorph frame clean angles and preventing drift into uncontrolled thrusts.
A journaling example would be: “Right hip drop, shallow, Light pressure, soft exhale at rep three.” This confirms angle, depth, and cue in one line.

=====================================================================================================




Module 3 for The Harrare is where the individual keystrokes begin to interlock into a full rhythm. The aim is not just to stack motions but to build a sequence where each action resets, breath anchors, and then flows into the next without collapse. Think of it as turning separate notes into music—each clear on its own, but joined to create something continuous.
Start by chaining the left hip drop into the right hip follow-through. From neutral, inhale, then exhale as the left hip lowers to brush the right wall shallow. Without pausing too long, inhale to steady at that low position, then exhale as the right hip joins, sweeping the shaft leftward across her canal into the north wall. What she feels is a smooth slide from side to roof, a pressure arc that should stay Light-to-Medium. As an Endomorph, you must guard against momentum; body mass can pull you deeper than intended, so keep forearms firm in plank and shoulders stacked over elbows to hold posture. Reset neutral fully before repeating.
Once this link feels stable, add the right hip lift. Inhale, then exhale as the right hip rises while the left stays low, sweeping the shaft back rightward across the north to the east wall. She experiences this as a return stroke, almost like a figure-eight curve. If her breath deepens or her hips press up, it’s a cue you’ve landed well. Reset into plank again, using an inhale to stabilize the spine. Then complete the cycle by lifting the left hip back up, guiding the shaft diagonally between right wall and south wall, returning to the downward diagonal baseline. This four-step chain is the first half of The Harrare in rhythm.
Mirror the same structure on the opposite side: right hip drop into left hip join, then left hip lift, then both hips up to baseline. Each time, reset fully at the top with neutral plank, steady breath, and shoulders stacked. This prevents fatigue from pulling depth uncontrolled, which is especially important with length above seven inches where mid or deep zones can overload quickly. The Endomorph body type offers natural pressure but must temper it by using breath anchors—inhale to prepare, exhale to move, pause to lighten.
The full stroke rhythm is built by joining these two halves into one cycle: left-dominant sweep into right-dominant sweep, each contained by neutral resets. Train slowly first, with each half-cycle taking at least two breaths: inhale for drop, exhale for sweep, inhale for lift, exhale for return. Over time, compress to single-breath cycles, but never skip the neutral pause. This pause is what gives your nervous system the clarity to chain fluidly without losing compass awareness.
She will feel The Harrare as a wave-like dance across her canal—right wall to roof to right wall to floor, then mirrored left wall to roof to left wall to floor. The alternating sweep creates a balanced stimulation, giving her cues like pelvic curls, stillness, or sighs that signal which half of the rhythm she favors. Your job is to track those cues, noting whether right-to-roof lands stronger than left-to-roof, and adjusting pressure or tempo accordingly. A journaling example would be: “Left cycle, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, hips pressed in on roof sweep.”
The reflection here is that chaining keystrokes builds neural pathways for rhythm. The Endomorph frame, when disciplined with resets, transforms body mass from risk into power, delivering steady arcs without collapse. Above-seven-inch length must always respect shallow dominance, grazing mid zones only if her body actively leans in. The Harrare, once chained, becomes less about thrust and more about sweeping her interior walls in alternating arcs, which is what gives it such unique effect.

=====================================================================================================






Module 4 for The Harrare is where you begin to test and refine the stroke in real time using the SSP method—defining, hypothesizing, tracking, and refining—while staying almost entirely in the shallow 80% depth zone. The purpose here is to develop precision, not power. Think of it as using a magnifying glass: you’re slowing down to see which parts of the arc ignite her the most.
Start by setting a clear baseline in plank, wrists stacked under shoulders, hips aligned, and the head of the penis angled on its downward diagonal. Inhale to prepare, then exhale as you drop into the first keystroke. Keep pressure Light to Medium so the shaft can glide without forcing depth. As an Endomorph with length above seven inches, this shallow discipline is critical; any slip deeper can crowd her cervix, cutting the session short. Instead, allow the sweep to graze the right wall into the roof and back, then pause to observe. Her cues will tell you everything: if her breath deepens or her hips press upward, you’ve touched a favored line. If her body stills or exhales softly, it’s another sign that wall contact is landing.
Run three to four slow cycles on one side, logging how she reacts. Journal a shorthand line like: “Right wall to roof, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, soft exhale on third rep.” Then reset fully into plank before testing the mirrored side. Keep each test in short mini-sets so fatigue doesn’t mask clarity. This also protects your joints from load creeping in through repetition. Inhale into neutral, exhale through the arc, then inhale again before the next cycle. Treat each repetition as a hypothesis: “Does she favor right-roof? Left-roof? Or the return sweep into the floor?”
If her responses are unclear, lighten pressure and slow tempo. Sometimes, clarity emerges only when the sweep is gentler, almost like drawing with a pencil instead of carving with a knife. Your mass as an Endomorph is an advantage when harnessed through breath and baseline stability, but it can overwhelm if you rush. Use your forearms and core to keep weight evenly spread, so hips glide without collapsing into hard contact.
Over time, patterns appear. You may find she consistently curls her pelvis when the shaft sweeps from wall into roof, or presses down when the return stroke hits the floor line. These observations refine your compass map. Once logged, you can build the stroke around her favored arcs while still keeping the full cycle intact for balance. The key in Module 4 is restraint—stay shallow, stay Light-to-Medium, and use SSP journaling to separate strong walls from weak ones.
The reflection is that tracking in this way trains your nervous system as much as it trains hers. You learn to notice tiny shifts in breath and body, which later allows you to adapt angles and pressure instantly without breaking rhythm. For her, this builds safety and intensity, as she feels you responding in real time. For you, it creates a disciplined foundation that prevents overstimulation of deep zones and ensures clarity of touch at every compass point.

=====================================================================================================


Module 5 for The Harrare is where you shift from tracking in isolated arcs to building flow across her favored compass walls. Flow means sustaining a rhythm that she can ride without interruption, while still keeping yourself grounded in plank and inside the 80–10–10 structure. The goal here is continuity: linking the keystrokes into a cycle that breath and body can repeat until her nervous system drops into immersion.
Begin by returning to your forearm plank baseline, hips aligned, shoulders braced, and weight spread evenly. Inhale to prepare, exhale as you slide into the first sweep. Choose the wall you discovered in Module 4 as her strongest response zone—whether it was right-roof, left-roof, or the return line into floor. Keep pressure Medium and stay in shallow 80% depth. Let the keystroke ripple from hip to shaft without rush, then immediately catch the rebound into the opposite arc. The reflection here is that flow is not about speed, but about smoothness; the transitions should feel like water folding back on itself.
As an Endomorph with above-average length, your task is restraint in depth and control in weight. Avoid collapsing hips downward, which can drive too deep. Instead, think of rocking side to side like a heavy pendulum, always resetting baseline before the next swing. Breath becomes the metronome: inhale at neutral, exhale through the stroke, then inhale again as you reset. At first, keep your cycle count to four or five, then rest in neutral so you don’t lose plank stability.
Her cues now matter even more. Flow shows itself in how her body starts to move without thought. If her hips press in time with you, or her pelvis curls up to meet the stroke, it means your rhythm has locked her nervous system. If she exhales sharply or grows still as you sustain the wall, keep the tempo and pressure there longer, letting her body melt into the repetition. Flow isn’t about variety; it’s about consistency that frees her from thinking.
You may test mid-zone entry only if she’s fully aroused and lubrication is clear. With a penis size above seven inches, mid-zone requires extra caution. Gently tilt angle upward on exhale, letting the head brush the roof without forcing depth. If her breath catches and hips rise, you’ve found a safe expansion. If she winces, stiffens, or pulls back, immediately return to shallow. These experiments should be rare and short; shallow 80% remains the base of flow.
The reflection is that Flow Phase teaches your body endurance and teaches hers surrender. Your weight distribution, breath pacing, and pressure discipline keep her safe while magnifying sensation. By keeping rhythm intact, you give her nervous system the chance to stack waves, leading toward longer climbs and multiple orgasms. Journal a short line after sets to track clarity, for example: “Left-roof sweep, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, hips rising by rep six.”
Ready to proceed to Module 6 for The Harrare with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


=====================================================================================================


Module 6 for The Harrare is where you cautiously test whether her body is ready to expand beyond shallow flow and explore the mid or deep ranges. With an endomorph frame and a penis above seven inches, the priority here is safety: your weight distribution must stay light, your depth tightly gated, and every expansion governed by her cues, not by your drive.
Start in your neutral plank baseline, hips steady and forearms rooted. Inhale deeply to anchor, then exhale into a controlled sweep along her preferred wall at shallow 80%. Only once her hips begin to rise on their own or her breath deepens into an open exhale should you consider adding depth. To do this, slightly angle the thrust so that the head tilts northward or southward, brushing toward mid-zone without letting your pelvis collapse forward. Think of it as leaning the pendulum slightly higher, not dropping it further down. This is Angling rather than Rocking, and the depth increase should be no more than one finger-width past your shallow rhythm.
She will tell you through her body if this is welcome. If her pelvis curls upward, her thighs tense then open, or she presses in, you can hold the mid-zone sweep for a breath or two before retreating to shallow. If her body stiffens, her hips pull back, or her breath catches in a guarded way, immediately exhale back to shallow 80% and reset. Never press deeper than mid unless lubrication is abundant, arousal is unmistakable, and her cues are actively calling for it. With a length above seven inches, deep-zone penetration risks striking the cervix harshly if you are not fully aligned, so treat deep 10% as a rare and sacred option rather than a routine move.
Your reflection during this phase is to let mid and deep zones act like seasoning, not the meal. Shallow flow is the base, and deeper pressure should only punctuate, not dominate. For an endomorph, protecting the shoulders and hips in plank means keeping the torso lifted and avoiding sagging weight. For above-average length, protecting her body means always checking that angle and tempo are soft enough to allow her tissues to open rather than resist.
In practice, aim for cycles where four to six shallow sweeps are followed by one cautious mid expansion, then a reset in neutral to protect your rhythm and her comfort. Journal lines should capture whether the body welcomed or resisted, such as: “North roof angle, mid-zone, Medium pressure, hips curled up by rep two.” This reflection trains you to spot patterns and refine your timing.
By respecting depth as an earned privilege, you make her feel safe while unlocking the intensity that only controlled expansion can bring. The deeper zones amplify pressure on nerve-dense regions, but only when her body has already surrendered. When you listen at this level, deep pressure becomes not just tolerable but transformative.

=====================================================================================================


Module 7 for The Harrare focuses on the pinning phase, when her body is already softened and sensitive from orgasm and you want to guide her into multiples through small, precise adjustments. With an endomorph build and a penis above seven inches, your advantage is stability and weight control, but your risk is pressing too hard or deep when her body is delicate. Pinning is not about force but about restraint and intelligent micro-variation.
Begin in your neutral forearm-plank baseline, hips stable and shoulders lifted to protect your joints. Exhale into a shallow sweep along her favored wall, letting the shaft rest more than drive. This is where you observe. If her breath steadies but doesn’t rise again, you need to tweak. A subtle Rocking motion, no more than a finger-width, along the right or left wall at shallow depth can restart the current. Keep pressure Light to Medium and let each adjustment ride on a soft exhale. Watch for her cues: a sudden pelvic curl, a new stillness, or a deeper intake of breath means you’ve touched the right chord.
When you find a responsive angle, test it with short controlled bursts—three to four measured cycles, then return to neutral. This preserves stamina and prevents overstimulation, which is critical given your length. Staying shallow keeps the stimulation on the nerve-rich outer canal where her body is most likely to ignite after orgasm. Resist the urge to chase deeper zones; at this stage, cervix contact will almost always shut her down rather than extend her pleasure.
Your reflection during pinning is to treat the stroke like a tuning fork. You touch, listen, adjust, and test again, never holding one pattern so long that it dulls the sensation. For an endomorph, your leverage allows you to hover and shift angles without losing control, but you must keep your chest lifted and shoulders stacked to prevent collapse under your own weight. For above-average length, the pinning phase is your discipline training: the head must remain shallow, the shaft angled so that only the sensitive ridges glide, not the full depth.
Journaling should capture these micro-moments in a single line, such as: “Left wall, shallow, Light pressure, pelvic curl after second burst.” This shorthand reinforces what works and reminds you that pinning is an art of subtle returns, not long drives. When done well, you will feel her hips press back into you involuntarily, her breath restart, and her body climb into another wave without you having to break rhythm.
Pinning is where control transforms into generosity. By holding restraint, you become the anchor she can trust, and that trust opens her body to lengths of pleasure that most men will never reach with her.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for The Harrare with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


=====================================================================================================




Module 8 for The Harrare brings everything together into a four-week training arc, designed for an endomorph body and a penis above seven inches. The goal here is not just to learn the mechanics, but to ingrain the rhythm until it becomes second nature. This module ties posture, keystroke practice, chaining, tracking, flow, and pinning into one integrated plan that sharpens execution while keeping your body safe and your partner’s pleasure at the center.
In the first week you should ground yourself in orientation and keystroke clarity. Spend your time returning to the neutral forearm-plank baseline, finding stability in your shoulders and hips, and practicing each keystroke in isolation. Keep pressure Light to Medium and work almost exclusively in the shallow 80%. For an endomorph frame, the focus is on not collapsing into your own weight; keep the chest lifted and the spine aligned. For above-average length, shallow control ensures you learn to angle the head without overshooting depth. Journal simple lines like: “Right wall, shallow, Medium pressure, smooth exhale through three reps.”
In the second week, begin chaining keystrokes into rhythm. Alternate sides of The Harrare sweep, first with half-sequences, then with full cycles. Each time, return to neutral before continuing. Exhale through the sweep, inhale to reset. Limit each set to short bursts of five or six reps, then pause to rest. The endurance management here is crucial: your endomorph build provides power, but if you push too long without resets, your lower back and shoulders will tighten. The long shaft length means you must keep hips slightly higher to avoid sliding too deep when chaining across diagonals.
In the third week, shift into Tracking and Flow phases. Now you start to test shallow sweeps against her cues. Watch for her hips pressing in, her breath deepening, or her pelvic tilt as feedback. When you see it, stay with that wall and keep rhythm until it fades, then reset. Flow can be extended across multiple walls, but always under shallow control first, and only venturing into mid-depth when lubrication and her body’s openness clearly invite it. Reflection here is key: each practice should end with a single journal line marking which wall and pressure triggered the clearest response.
In the fourth week, begin layering in Pinning strategy after her first orgasm. Short, controlled bursts on the sensitive outer walls will guide her body toward multiples. Use Light pressure, shallow depth, and quick reflection pauses between each burst. For above-average length, discipline is everything: never chase depth here, as it risks shutting her down. Your endurance advantage as an endomorph allows you to hover in plank and hold space, but you must keep shoulders stacked and forearms firm to prevent collapse. By the end of this week, you will be able to cycle through orientation, keystrokes, flow, and pinning smoothly without breaking rhythm or posture.
This integrated plan will sharpen you into a man whose control and precision mark him as irreplaceable. The repetition builds stamina and body memory, while the journal entries keep your adjustments clear and intentional. With each week you become not just practiced, but disciplined, able to offer her a depth of sensation most men never reach.
