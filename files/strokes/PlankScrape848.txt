Module 1 for Plank Scrape teaches you how to set your foundation. Everything in this stroke depends on how you hold your body in forearm-plank, how you manage pressure through your core, and how you control depth so that friction, not force, defines the sensation. The goal of this first module is to make your body a stable lever rather than a heavy engine. You’ll learn how to align joints, manage stamina, and feel clarity along the walls without losing breath or balance.
Start by finding your forearm-plank baseline. Place your forearms flat on the canvas, elbows directly under your shoulders, wrists straight ahead, and hands relaxed. Spread your fingers slightly to help distribute load evenly. Keep your knees lightly on the canvas for now—this is not weakness but calibration. Inhale deeply through the nose, allowing your abdomen to expand downward, then exhale slowly as you draw your core tight and lift your hips just enough to align your spine with your shoulders. This neutral plank is your home position. From here, every motion—Rocking or Angling—begins and ends. For an Endomorph, this setup controls weight and joint strain. Your mass is an advantage for stability, but it must be supported by continuous core tension, not by dumping weight into your wrists or elbows.
Once the body feels balanced, focus on breath as your internal rhythm driver. On each inhale, feel your spine lengthen slightly as the pelvis tilts forward. On each exhale, let your abdomen contract, pulling your hips gently under to reinforce alignment. This breath wave trains endurance. When you eventually lean into a wall, this same breath timing will control how deeply you enter. For a shaft under 5 inches, your power lies in precision—every millimeter of Rocking movement changes sensation drastically. Breath becomes your metronome, marking how much pressure you apply and how long you hold. The cue for perfect depth is contact that feels firm but smooth; too deep and friction fades, too shallow and tension disappears.
From this posture, practice gentle Rocking in shallow 80 percent range without penetration. The motion should come from the hips, not the shoulders. Inhale to prepare, then exhale as you tilt your pelvis slightly left, keeping your chest still. Return to center on the next inhale. Repeat to the right. The sensation should be one of steady side-to-side glides, not thrusts. This small Rocking prepares your body for the diagonal Lean keystrokes you’ll build in later modules. It strengthens the connection between breath, pelvis, and compass direction. For shorter length, this precision Rocking ensures full wall coverage even without deep reach.
Next, shift focus to Angling control—the vertical movement that defines the Lift and Drop later in the stroke. Inhale as you brace, then exhale slowly while raising the hips one or two inches, maintaining spine alignment. Pause at the top for one breath, then lower back on the next exhale. This range—only a few inches—trains your nervous system to control friction depth consciously. Keep pressure Light-to-Medium and stop before your elbows or wrists feel compressed. She would feel these small changes as warm, smooth glides rather than forceful strokes, and her breathing will deepen when the range is right. If you feel her hips pressing upward, that’s confirmation you’re seated properly at mid zone. If her body stiffens, retreat to shallow.
Finish this session by returning to your neutral forearm-plank and taking three slow breaths. Feel how your weight distributes evenly, how your shoulders, spine, and hips align. This neutral baseline is your safety net. It resets circulation and prevents joint fatigue. The reflection after each session should be simple—what felt steady, what drifted. Record one journal line such as, “Neutral baseline steady, Medium pressure, shallow Rocking smooth at left wall.” Over time, these lines become a map of what your body can hold without strain.
Remember, as an Endomorph, your advantage is grounded strength. Your challenge is mobility and pacing. Shorter range means you don’t chase depth—you sculpt width. Keep your movements small, deliberate, and rhythmically anchored to your breath. The more precise your baseline, the cleaner every future keystroke becomes. This is the stage where control replaces effort.

=====================================================================================
Module 2 for Plank Scrape teaches you to isolate and master each keystroke that makes the stroke possible. You’re breaking the movement into its essential pieces—Diagonal Lean, Vertical Lift, Vertical Drop, and Anchor Reset—and learning how each interacts with your body weight, her internal walls, and the pressure rhythm that defines the stroke’s texture. This is where your coordination between Rocking and Angling becomes sharp. Every action begins from the same neutral forearm-plank baseline you built in Module 1. For an Endomorph, these keystrokes must be powered from the abdomen and hips, not the arms or shoulders, to prevent fatigue. With a shaft under 5 inches, your goal is total wall coverage through width and precision rather than amplitude or depth.
Start with the Diagonal Lean. From your neutral plank, inhale to brace, then exhale as you shift the pelvis left, pressing the shaft toward her right wall in shallow 80 percent depth. This is a Rocking keystroke—gentle and lateral, not thrusting. Keep your chest still and let the motion come entirely from the hips. The lean is small, no more than a palm’s width from center, just enough for the glans to drag friction across the opposite wall. Maintain Light to Medium pressure and smooth exhale through each lean. She will respond with a deeper breath or a slow press of her hips into the contact if the wall engagement is right. When practicing to the opposite side, mirror the motion—Right Lean engages her left wall. For a shorter shaft, keeping this width focus ensures constant surface contact even without deep reach.
The next keystroke is the Vertical Lift. It’s an Angling motion that creates the scrape-out phase. From the established lean, inhale to stabilize and exhale as you raise your hips two inches while maintaining the same diagonal tilt. The glans should stay in contact along her wall as you extract, creating a thin, smooth frictional line from mid 10 percent toward shallow 80 percent. This lift must stay deliberate and calm—too fast and you lose control, too high and you lose contact. The correct internal effect is a warm, stretching pull. For an Endomorph, core engagement keeps this action precise without compressing the wrists. With shorter length, limit the lift to one or two inches; this ensures you remain within consistent friction range. Her cue is a soft exhale or a pause in her hips as she feels that controlled glide.
Follow this with the Vertical Drop, the re-entry that defines the scraping feel. Maintain the same diagonal lean as you inhale, then exhale as you lower the hips slowly, guiding the shaft back into the mid 10 percent depth with Medium pressure. The motion should feel like tracing the same path backward, not a thrust but a controlled descent. The glans drags along the same wall, producing continuous friction through pressure and texture. Your abdominal tension acts as a brake, ensuring gravity doesn’t take over. For an Endomorph, this discipline protects the lower back. For shorter length, this precision maximizes stimulation by staying in high-contact zones rather than slipping into unproductive depth. If her hips rise slightly or her breath deepens on the drop, you’re aligned correctly.
The final keystroke is the Anchor Reset. After one or two lift-drop cycles, inhale and square your hips back to center, returning to your neutral forearm-plank baseline. This is both Rocking and Angling in miniature, drawing your body back into alignment while maintaining Light contact at shallow 80 percent. The goal is to restore symmetry and give your joints a break. During this reset, her cues might soften—gentle stillness or slow exhale—which confirms balance between pressure and friction. If her hips shift away, it means you need a longer pause or lighter entry next cycle.
To train these keystrokes, practice them separately first. Spend time feeling how the Diagonal Lean opens the wall, then add the Vertical Lift and Drop only when your control feels effortless. The sequence should feel like one continuous wave: Lean sets direction, Lift extracts, Drop re-engages, and Reset clears tension. For shorter length, the magic comes from precision—each keystroke must flow into the next without gaps in friction. Each movement should begin and end with full wall sensation.
End each session by breathing into your core while holding the neutral plank for two full breaths. This stabilizes your joints and reinforces proprioception. A simple journal line could read, “Left Lean → Lift/Drop smooth, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, hips stable.” These micro-notes capture how your stroke interacts with pressure and rhythm. Over time, your keystroke accuracy becomes instinctive, and the full stroke will feel effortless and responsive.
Ready to proceed to Module 3 for Plank Scrape with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches?


=====================================================================================
Perfect. We’ll proceed directly into Module 3 — Flow Control for Plank Scrape (Endomorph, Below 5 inches) using the same ninth-grade readability and continuous paragraph structure.
Module 3 transitions you from isolated keystrokes to rhythmic flow. You’re now combining the Diagonal Lean, Vertical Lift, and Vertical Drop into a steady, repeatable cycle that keeps friction constant while protecting endurance. For an Endomorph, flow control depends on anchoring body weight through the hips instead of the shoulders. Keep the forearms grounded, elbows stacked under shoulders, spine straight, and eyes down. Every breath dictates tempo. Inhale to prepare, exhale through motion, and never rush the return to baseline. A short shaft finds its strength not in length but in how cleanly it rides the same wall path without losing contact.
Begin with the left-sided Plank Scrape. From neutral plank, shift the pelvis slightly left, guiding the head of the penis along her right wall. Exhale slowly as you lift two inches, maintaining that left diagonal, then inhale to pause. On the next exhale, drop the hips back down along the same diagonal path, feeling the glans trace the same line inward. That’s one smooth cycle. The rhythm should feel like a calm pulse—rock, lift, drop, breathe. You’re blending Rocking and Angling into one unified motion that feels both directional and weighted. Keep the pressure in Medium range and let each exhale last through the entire motion. If she’s responding, her breath will deepen and her hips may curl in to meet the pressure. If her body stiffens or pulls away, your depth or pressure is too strong; lighten slightly and let the exhale guide the correction.
When you move to the right-sided variation, mirror the same breath-timed pattern—shift pelvis right, press into her left wall, lift and drop through the same range. Shorter length demands that you maintain shallower 80 percent depth on the lift and finish just under mid 10 percent on the drop. This ensures the glans never leaves contact. Each repetition should feel like sliding a brush along the same strip of canvas—firm, smooth, consistent. Endomorphs should watch for collapsing shoulders or sagging hips; these mistakes waste energy and distort angle precision. Reset every few cycles with a deep inhale and a one-count pause at neutral before beginning again.
As you gain control, alternate sides in slow sets—two cycles left, two cycles right. Keep the transitions seamless by pivoting through center without breaking wall contact. Use your abdominal wall as the metronome: inhale at center, exhale through lean and scrape, inhale again to float into the opposite lean. Her most reliable cues are soft sighs or a subtle pelvic lift. If she grows still and quiet, hold that diagonal and slow your rhythm. Flow control is less about speed and more about timing friction with her breath.
After five to six minutes of this rhythm practice, finish with three slow baseline holds—neutral plank, shallow insertion, full inhale and exhale to rest the spine. This restores blood flow to the forearms and wrists. Journal your observations in one clear line, such as, “Right wall, steady exhale, shallow 80%, smooth through four reps, hips stable.” These short notes train awareness for later modules.
Module 3 completes your transition from mechanical precision to rhythmic stability. Once the flow feels natural and your control remains steady without fatigue, you’ll be ready to enter Module 4, where timing, pulse shifts, and micro-pressure variations start to shape the emotional tone of the stroke.

=====================================================================================
Module 4 takes the Plank Scrape into the Tracking Phase—where rhythm, pressure, and wall selection are refined using the SSP loop. You’re no longer just practicing motion; you’re learning to listen through friction. The goal is to build consistency inside the shallow 80 percent zone while testing small pressure shifts and observing how each one changes her cues. For an Endomorph, this phase is about conserving joint energy while expanding tactile precision. Keep your forearms stable, abs tight, and use micro hip tilts—not shoulder pushes—to control stroke depth.
Start from the neutral plank. Insert shallow—just enough to make steady wall contact without pressure spikes. Exhale as you rock forward along the right diagonal, inhale as you reset. Keep each cycle under two seconds, like a calm tide. Your first SSP pass defines the baseline: light pressure, constant contact, steady rhythm. Hypothesize how small increases in pressure might change her response, then test that over a few reps. Medium pressure should make her exhale audibly or press her hips back; if she tenses or breath shortens, that’s feedback to reduce load. Each trial is one data point.
As you track through mini-sets, always run four to six cycles per adjustment before refining. Endomorph control depends on conserving torque: use your core to shift, not your arms. Keep the spine level, glutes engaged, and shoulders quiet. Every keystroke—lift, drop, or diagonal sweep—should happen inside the same shallow channel to keep the glans tracing the same nerve path. This constancy is what trains her to recognize your rhythm as safety, which later allows intensity. Below-five-inch depth means your mid-10 zone is limited, so think of the scrape as painting sensation across width, not depth.
Journal each SSP pass in short, clear lines that name wall, pressure, and reaction: “Right wall, med press, hips follow, keep tempo.” Use these logs to refine wall targeting for future modules. Over time, you’ll map her preferred friction corridors—those spots where her hips always roll back or her exhale turns to a moan. That’s data, not luck. The next step is linking it to controlled flow.
Close the session with three slow neutral resets. Full inhale, relax hips to neutral, and let the spine decompress. Tracking isn’t about speed; it’s about control, endurance, and awareness. When your notes show repeatable response patterns and your body can sustain five minutes of steady rhythm without collapse or tension, you’ve mastered the tracking phase.
Ready to proceed to Module 5 — Flow Phase (Shallow-Mid Integration) for Plank Scrape (Endomorph, Below 5 inches)?


=====================================================================================
Module 5 takes the Plank Scrape into the Flow Phase, where the isolated keystrokes and pressure tracking merge into continuous, uninterrupted motion. This is where control becomes instinct. The man’s task is to maintain wall contact through every inch of movement while keeping breath and tempo perfectly aligned. For an Endomorph, flow means rhythm without strain—every ounce of body weight supported by core and hips, never arms. With a shorter shaft, you’ll build illusion of depth through sustained glide and angle discipline. She feels constancy. You feel control.
Begin from neutral forearm plank. Inhale through the nose, brace the abdomen, and exhale as you lean left—glans pressing gently into her right wall. Without breaking that diagonal, start the vertical lift, guiding the head up along her wall, keeping pressure Light-to-Medium. Inhale to hold at the top, exhale through the vertical drop, tracing the same line back in. Immediately flow to the right diagonal—shift hips right, engage her left wall, repeat the same lift and drop sequence. The movement becomes a slow figure-eight made of diagonals, each side feeding the next. You’re combining Rocking (the lean) and Angling (the lift/drop) in one seamless circuit.
The key to Flow is the breath anchor. Inhale through reset, exhale through the action. Never hold breath. Each exhale carries weight down the diagonal and each inhale prepares your base for the next cycle. If you feel your shoulders tensing or wrists loading, stop, inhale fully, and reestablish your neutral plank alignment—elbows under shoulders, pelvis level, abs tight. For Endomorphs, maintain small hip shifts instead of wide arcs. Control the range; never let the motion yank your lumbar spine or overextend your wrists. With a shorter length, focus on consistent wall pressure rather than depth penetration. You’re creating unbroken contact rather than thrusts.
The Flow Phase introduces rhythmic feedback. She’ll start syncing her breath to yours, exhaling with your drop, inhaling with your reset. Her body might soften, hips may circle into your diagonal, or her exhale might turn into a hum or sigh. These are your tempo markers. When she stiffens, lightens pressure. When she exhales deeply, maintain that groove. The discipline here is to keep your attention in your abdomen, not your ego—feel her response as data, not approval.
Finish each set with three slow resets to center. Let your spine settle and shoulders open. Journal short, sensory reflections like, “Left-right flow smooth, shallow 80%, hips steady, full exhale, calm rhythm.” This keeps feedback loop active for later intensity modules. Flow mastery is complete when you can sustain continuous scraping on both diagonals for five minutes without breaking breath rhythm or losing wall contact.
Once your flow feels steady and you can sense her cues without looking or adjusting, you’re ready for Module 6 — Pinning Phase (Mid-Pressure and Wall Lock) for Plank Scrape, Body Type: Endomorph, Penis Size: Below 5 inches.
 Ready to continue?


=====================================================================================
Module 6 moves the Plank Scrape into controlled depth and mid-pressure work—the deep 10 percent zone where precision replaces force. You’re not chasing depth; you’re guarding intensity. This is the first time you’ll test wall lock and short, anchored pressure bursts designed to engage her cervix reflex safely. For an Endomorph, control comes from grounding mass efficiently—hips low, abs engaged, forearms steady. With a shorter shaft, your goal isn’t to reach deeper but to magnify the feeling of pressure by compressing space, not length. Depth becomes illusion through torque and breath.
Start from neutral plank. Inhale fully, tighten the abdomen, and on the exhale, drive a slow diagonal lean left, bringing the glans to her right wall. Instead of lifting this time, hold that angle and drop the hips a single inch forward. This shift activates mid-zone compression—about 10 percent deeper than your normal shallow path. Keep pressure in Medium range; your breath must stay smooth or you’re forcing. Exhale through the hold, inhale through reset. Do three slow pulses on that same diagonal before returning to center. Each pulse should feel like a small heartbeat—press, breathe, release. Her cues tell you if pressure is right: steady breath, pelvis curling in, maybe a low moan. If she flinches or stiffens, return immediately to shallow 80 percent for two breaths before testing again.
Move to the opposite diagonal and repeat. Always keep the glans tracing a consistent wall line. Don’t drive straight in; maintain your scrape curve. This is how short length turns into full-body density—she feels continuous motion, not distance. Endomorph strength allows longer holds, but your challenge is breath discipline. Exhale through tension; never push into silence. Flow three cycles left, three right, then pause in neutral. Allow your shoulders to release, inhale deeply, and observe how your abdomen feels—tense, tired, or still charged. This body awareness becomes your gatekeeper for fatigue.
After the first series, test a gentle mid-depth sequence. Start shallow, exhale and press slightly deeper on the diagonal, then inhale to ease back to the surface. That single inhale-exhale motion defines your safe mid-10 rhythm. Never exceed it. Below-five-inch mechanics mean you’re using contact consistency and pelvic torque to simulate fullness. She feels it as thicker pressure, not longer reach. Keep lubrication fresh and pace slower than in previous modules.
Close with a full recovery set—three slow breaths at neutral plank, letting the hips sag slightly to release the lumbar. Journal one line such as, “Right wall mid 10%, held two breaths, hips followed, no flinch.” That’s proof of controlled depth.
When you can sustain that stable mid-pressure for several cycles without losing breath rhythm or wall contact, your foundation is ready for advanced pressure play. The next phase introduces the Pinning and Orgasm Trigger work.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 — Pinning Post-Orgasm Strategy for Plank Scrape (Endomorph, Below 5 inches)?


=====================================================================================
Module 7 brings the Plank Scrape into the Pinning Phase, where control turns to precision arousal. You’re no longer building rhythm—you’re weaponizing stillness. This phase teaches how to hold her in the moment after climax and create secondary waves using micro-adjustments in angle, pressure, and timing. For an Endomorph, the advantage lies in weight distribution and endurance; your core can stay low and stable while small pelvic torques do all the work. With a below-five-inch length, you’ll rely on angle fidelity, not depth, to spark repeat orgasms. The secret is less movement, more awareness.
Begin from neutral plank and guide into shallow contact. Let your weight settle through your hips until your shaft is fully aligned against her preferred wall. Exhale slowly through your nose and feel her exhale match yours. That synch is the signal to begin. On the next breath, press forward an inch and hold—Medium pressure, shallow 80 percent depth. No thrusting, no rocking yet. Just the quiet density of contact. Her body will either melt into it or tense slightly. Observe. If she stays still or curls her hips toward you, hold for one more full breath. When she exhales or trembles, that’s the start of the reflex. Now you use micro Rocking. Lean left a centimeter, exhale. Lean right, inhale. Each shift sends subtle waves through her walls, like ripples under skin.
The goal is to pin the nerve corridor where her last orgasm peaked. You’ll find it because her breath changes or her pelvis seeks it again. Once found, stay there. Pressure should oscillate between Light and Medium—never more. Below-five-inch mechanics amplify friction response; depth is limited, but precision magnifies sensation. Exhale through each micro Rock, inhale as you reset in the same line. Keep this loop for up to one minute, then let go completely—hips drop, breath releases, you hover above her. The pause is what recharges her.
Run this Observe → Tweak → Test loop three times, alternating diagonals. Watch her cues: if her eyes glaze or body trembles, you’re on target. If she fidgets or pulls back, reduce torque or lighten pressure. Endomorphs must protect joints here—keep forearms steady and minimize shoulder load. Your power is in pelvic micro-control, not upper-body motion.
Close by resetting to neutral. Take three deep breaths, let the hips rest on the canvas, and feel your own pulse slow. Journal your result in plain prose: “Left diagonal, light press, one breath hold, hips curled twice.” That’s all you need. Pinning mastery means you can stay inside post-orgasm energy without breaking rhythm or losing awareness.
When your body can sustain these micro adjustments without fatigue or tension, you’re ready for the final integration—the full training plan that fuses every phase into a repeatable practice cycle.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 — Training Plan & Integration for Plank Scrape (Endomorph, Below 5 inches)?


=====================================================================================
Module 8 completes the Plank Scrape by building a four-week integration cycle that fuses orientation, keystroke control, flow rhythm, and pinning precision into one continuous body discipline. The purpose is not performance but repeatable mastery—turning what began as a set of technical drills into an instinct that lives in your nervous system. For an Endomorph, the practice must protect joints while leveraging natural strength and weight distribution; for a below-five-inch size, consistency of wall contact and angle integrity are the legacy goals. Each week compounds endurance, awareness, and sensitivity through planned cycles of training, recovery, and reflection.
Start every session with two minutes of forearm-plank alignment. Elbows under shoulders, pelvis level, abs engaged. Inhale to prepare, exhale to settle. This resets the neural map before work begins. Week one focuses only on the keystrokes—the left and right diagonals, vertical lift, and controlled drop—trained in isolation. Each motion should begin with a deep inhale, press through the exhale, then return to neutral without haste. Keep pressure Light to Medium and remain in shallow 80 percent depth. Journal one line per session like, “Right wall scrape steady, shallow, even breath, hips level.” The goal is wall clarity, not endurance.
Week two merges keystrokes into continuous flow. Move from one diagonal to the other without losing breath timing. Train in three-minute sets, resting a full minute between each. For Endomorphs, limit range to protect lumbar joints and wrists; the energy must stay in the hips. Shorter length means you focus on uninterrupted surface contact—gliding instead of reaching. If fatigue sets in, return to neutral and breathe until heart rate stabilizes. Record short notes such as, “Flow left-right smooth, pressure Medium, steady exhale.”
Week three introduces mid-depth testing from Module 6. Choose the diagonal that feels most stable and add short, controlled compressions into mid-10 zone. Hold each for a full breath, then retreat to shallow track. Perform no more than three mid-depth pulses per side per set. Endomorph mass helps stabilize these holds; let breath, not momentum, control pressure. Below-five-inch mechanics depend on consistent wall contact, so focus on maintaining curve integrity rather than chasing penetration. Journal sensory outcomes—“Right diagonal mid-10, two-breath hold, hips followed, calm exhale.”
Week four integrates Pinning. Begin with three minutes of shallow flow to warm the connection, then choose one wall and apply the Observe → Tweak → Test sequence from Module 7. Hold pressure steady for one or two breaths, adjust micro-angle by a centimeter, then test again. Stop if shoulders tighten or breath shortens. End each session by lying flat, hands under chest, breathing deeply to release tension through the spine. Write a closing note such as, “Left wall pinned, Light pressure, soft exhale, relaxed core.” These brief reflections complete the SSP loop and train your body to learn from its own data.
By the end of this four-week cycle, your plank posture will feel effortless, your wall mapping instinctive, and your breath rhythm automatic. What began as mechanical training becomes embodied communication—your weight, angle, and breath translating directly into her experience of safety and intensity. Endomorph structure now serves as grounded power rather than bulk; shorter length becomes an asset in control and precision. Maintain rest hygiene—never more than twenty active cycles without pause—and keep joints aligned under the same neutral plank geometry that started this journey.
I am ready to generate Modules 1–8 for Plank Scrape with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches.
