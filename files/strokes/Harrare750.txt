Module 1 for the Harrare is about setting your body up so the stroke can be trained safely, with clarity in how it feels for both you and her. The base position is a forearm plank, where your elbows stay directly under your shoulders and your forearms run forward. This setup prevents shoulder collapse and keeps your core engaged so your hips can rock and angle without dumping pressure into your lower back. From this neutral baseline, your shaft begins angled slightly downward into her canal. That diagonal entry gives you a clear reference point to build each keystroke. Breathing is the anchor here: inhale to prepare, exhale to drop or sweep, then inhale again as you return to baseline. Every cycle begins and ends at this plank neutral, where your body resets before the next motion.
Because your frame is ectomorph, meaning long and lean, you have leverage but also more strain risk in the joints. The plank position solves this by distributing weight evenly through your shoulders and core, so your hips don’t sag and pull you deeper than planned. With a shaft longer than seven inches, depth control is not optional—it is your guardrail. The 80–10–10 rule keeps most of your work in shallow zones, which means the top eighty percent of her canal. Only the mid ten percent is touched when her body clearly allows it, and the deep ten percent is avoided unless cued. This zoning protects her cervix while making sure your length is used to stimulate walls and ridges instead of forcing depth.
From here, the focus is on joint load management. Your shoulders stay stacked, your spine long, your hips floating rather than collapsing. Think of your body like a suspension bridge: strong through the middle so each sway of the hips is controlled. If you let your hips sag, the long levers of an ectomorph frame magnify that error and make the stroke sloppy or unsafe. Instead, each keystroke will feel sharper because the base posture gives it stability. Pressure is capped at Medium for this body type and size, since Hard pressure risks collapse and shortens your stamina window.
The other part of orientation is breath. Every move has a breath pair: inhale to gather, exhale to press or sweep, inhale again to restore. This keeps rhythm clean and prevents holding tension in your shoulders or jaw. For her, that breath anchor in you becomes an unspoken signal. She will often mirror it—her breath deepening or hips pressing in when your exhale carries into a wall stroke. That is why posture and breath are the foundation. Without them, the keystrokes blur and cues become hard to read. With them, each wall touch is distinct and her feedback is easy to track.
Journal this first practice in a single sentence like, “Baseline plank steady, shallow diagonal entry, Medium pressure capped.” That reminder sets the tone for every later session.

Module 2 for the Harrare is about breaking down the stroke into its keystrokes so you can train each one as a building block. Every keystroke begins from the same neutral forearm-plank baseline you set in Module 1, and each one has a clear body motion, a Rocking or Angling quality, a compass wall target, a depth zone, and a pressure band anchored to breath. Because you are ectomorph with a shaft above seven inches, every move must respect leverage and depth gating: more shallow, more precise, and always capped at Medium pressure unless her body clearly invites more.
The first keystroke is the left hip drop. From neutral plank you inhale, then as you exhale you let your left hip sink toward the canvas. This angles your shaft across her canal so the head presses into her right wall. The motion is primarily Rocking, though there is a subtle Angling effect from the diagonal tilt. The touch lands shallow in the top eighty percent, and the pressure should be Light to Medium. With your longer length, shallow angle keeps her comfortable while still giving her a broad massage along the wall. Her cue here may be a deeper inhale or her hips tilting slightly into the pressure. If she stiffens, you ease back to Light.
The second keystroke is the right hip follow. From the end of the left hip drop, you continue exhaling and allow your right hip to join the left near the canvas. This draws the head of your shaft across from right wall to the north wall, sweeping upward inside her. This is a pure Angling move, changing the direction of your tip rather than just rocking the shaft. Depth stays shallow, with a possible brush into mid if her pelvis rolls open, but you should treat it as eighty percent unless invited. The cue to look for is her pelvic curl or a soft exhale—signals that she is opening to the stroke. You inhale as you reset to baseline, keeping your core tight to protect your ectomorph joints.
The third keystroke is the right hip lift back to start. From the low hip position you exhale and raise your right hip back up while keeping the left low. This sweeps your shaft across from the north wall back to the right wall. It is both Rocking and Angling, since the shaft pivots as your body twists. The zone is shallow again, pressure Light to Medium, and rhythmically this keystroke sets you up for Flow. Her cue will often be a stilling of her body or a deeper breath, which means the sweep is hitting sensitive ridges. Adjust tempo to slower if she stills, faster only if she presses in.
The fourth keystroke completes the cycle. You lift both hips back to neutral, which draws your shaft down toward the south wall at a downward diagonal. This is a Rocking reset stroke, shallow by default, and pressure should be Light so the return is smooth. She may respond with a small hip press, letting you know she feels the return as connective rather than empty. This brings you back to the clean baseline plank where the next cycle begins.
The mirrored half of the Harrare repeats the same logic but led with the right hip drop first. From neutral, inhale and exhale into the right hip lowering toward the canvas, pressing your shaft into her left wall. The Angling here is clear, with shallow touch on the left. Then you let the left hip join, sweeping upward across to the north wall. Next, you lift the left hip back while the right stays low, sweeping back across to the left wall. Finally, you lift back to neutral, returning through the south wall diagonal. Each half mirrors the other, giving you a figure-eight pattern inside her canal.
For ectomorph frames, the key safeguard is to keep every drop controlled and never slam hips into the canvas. Your length above seven inches means you must actively gate depth—staying shallow and only brushing mid zones when her cues are clear. Medium pressure is your ceiling, with Light as the safe default. Each keystroke should last a breath cycle: inhale to prepare, exhale through the action, inhale back to neutral. Journal this practice in one line as, “Left hip drop, shallow right wall, Medium pressure, her breath deepened at rep three.”

===================================================================================


Module 3 for the Harrare is where the stroke comes together. The focus now is chaining the keystrokes you’ve learned into one smooth rhythm that your body can repeat without conscious thought. Think of it like learning a dance: first you drilled each step, now you start linking them into a flowing pattern. The key is pacing, breath control, and never skipping the return to neutral so your joints and depth stay safe.
From baseline plank, inhale, then exhale into the first hip drop. Let that roll into the sweep across the wall, then ride your breath into the counter-lift and reset diagonal. Each keystroke should still feel distinct in your body, but the transitions are now softened so the shaft feels like it is tracing one continuous loop inside her. Rocking and Angling blend here—your hips dropping and rising create Rocking weight, while the diagonal sweeps cut angles across her canal. The compass logic is right wall to north to right wall to south, then mirrored on the left, forming a figure-eight pattern. Keep the action shallow in the eighty percent zone unless her cues—pelvic curl, hips pressing in, or a stilling of her breath—tell you mid is welcome.
Pacing is critical for ectomorph frames. Do not rush the sequence. One full figure-eight cycle should take four to six breaths. That slower tempo keeps your core engaged and spares your shoulders and hips from overload. With a shaft above seven inches, your main guardrail is depth. Stay Light to Medium in pressure, never Hard unless she opens fully and her breath deepens in invitation. If you ignore these cues, you risk hitting too deep and breaking her rhythm, which will also fatigue you faster.
As you chain, use the SSP loop in miniature. Define the stroke as a figure-eight, hypothesize her preferred wall response, track her cues during each loop, and refine by emphasizing the sweep where she responds. If her breath deepens more on the right wall sweep, give that part a touch more time. If she curls her hips on the north wall brush, slow there. Journaling after practice helps you capture this: “Right wall sweep at shallow, Medium, pelvic curl at rep five.”
Your reflection after each practice set is to notice not only her cues but also your own load. If your wrists ache, widen your plank stance. If your hips tire, reset more often at neutral. For ectomorphs, overtraining leads to burnout fast. Three to four figure-eight cycles followed by a pause at neutral is ideal for building muscle memory while protecting joints. Over time, the chaining becomes neural plasticity—your nervous system wires the sequence together so it feels natural.

===================================================================================


Module 4 for the Harrare is where you sharpen the stroke through Tracking. The focus now is running structured SSP in the shallow eighty percent zone, forming clear hypotheses, testing in short sets, observing her cues, and refining your compass navigation. The work here is not about flow but about data. Each loop becomes a chance to measure which wall she responds to most clearly.
Begin from baseline forearm plank, inhale, then exhale into your first right-side figure-eight sweep. Keep the pressure Light to Medium and stay strictly in the shallow band. This preserves safety for a shaft above seven inches and ensures clarity of feedback without overwhelming her. Define your hypothesis at the start of a set: for example, “She will respond more on the right wall sweep.” Run four to six reps, tracking her breathing, the small curls of her hips, and any stillness that signals a rise in arousal. If cues match, note it mentally and journal after. If they do not, refine the next set toward another wall.
Ectomorph frames must treat this as technical training. Do not overload your shoulders or hips by chasing long sets. Three or four loops are enough to gather data. Reset fully to neutral plank, breathe, and then start again. Keep your elbows under shoulders and your spine long to avoid collapse. Your leverage is naturally light, so let that work in your favor—her canal will read the walls clearly without excess pressure. A single metaphor can help: think of this like dipping a paintbrush into different parts of the canvas to see which color draws her eye. You are sampling, not committing to a final piece.
Her cues will guide refinement. A deeper exhale may confirm your target. A subtle pelvic curl or hips pressing in often shows desire for more time on that wall. If she goes still, it may mean the contact is on point and she is riding the sensation. Adjust tempo by slowing the sweep slightly, or angle by dropping the hip deeper. Pressure remains Light to Medium—avoid Hard until Flow and only if her cues demand it. Journal each set in one clean line, such as, “North wall, shallow, Medium, hips pressed in at rep three.” Over time, these notes build your wall map for her body.
The outcome of this module is clarity. You finish with a tested sense of her favored compass points and your body’s reliable ability to reset baseline without strain. That prepares you for Module 5, where Flow begins.

===================================================================================


Module 5 for the Harrare shifts you from testing to sustaining Flow. You now take the strongest compass cues discovered in Tracking and ride them in rhythm, holding her in the shallow eighty percent with the option to edge toward the mid ten if her body allows.
Begin in neutral plank, inhale to settle your core, then exhale into the chosen keystroke sweep—whether right, left, or north wall is less important than staying consistent. Let the motion turn into a repeating cycle, pressure set to Light for warm entry, then rising toward Medium as her breath deepens or her hips start to press in. Flow is not about experimenting every rep but about building trust in rhythm. For an ectomorph with a shaft above seven inches, this means relying on leverage, not force. Keep shoulders stacked and hips steady; your frame is naturally light, so avoid collapsing into her. Let the length carry contact across walls while you manage depth with restraint.
Her responses will tell you when the Flow is correct. A steady deepening breath, a soft exhale on your down sweep, or the body going quiet as she rides the internal sensation—all are signs to hold the compass you are on. If she curls her pelvis upward, it is usually an invitation for a touch more pressure or a slower tempo. With longer length, guard against drifting into the deep ten unless she pulls you in. Even mid-zone entry must be cued by her. Think of Flow like staying in a groove of music: once you find the beat, you stay on it rather than improvising.
Sustain for three to five cycles, then return to baseline. Resetting protects your ectomorph frame and gives her a chance to breathe into the afterglow. Journal each set in one simple line, such as, “Right wall, shallow, Medium pressure, Flow held for four cycles, hips pressed in.” Over time, these notes will show which walls consistently hold her in rhythm.
Your aim in this module is to engrain the feeling of Flow—how to sustain contact without breaking baseline or overloading your joints. With this foundation, you can step into Module 6 where controlled deep options are introduced.

===================================================================================


Module 6 for the Harrare is where you carefully explore controlled expansion into the mid and deep zones. Up to now, most of your training has been in the shallow eighty percent, where stamina protection and rhythm clarity are safest. With a shaft above seven inches, you already carry more natural depth, so your job here is not to force deeper, but to test whether her body actively receives it.
Start in a clean plank, inhale to stabilize, then exhale as you let the pelvis drop a little more on a selected keystroke. The motion blends Rocking and Angling, and instead of sweeping only across the shallow compass walls, you now allow the head to track a longer arc into the mid ten. Think of it like dipping a brush just slightly deeper into paint—you want the contact, but not the splatter. This should always be done with Medium pressure at most, never Hard, and only if she shows readiness with an upward pelvic curl, hips pulling you in, or a sound that signals release. If she stills or her breath shortens, you return to shallow immediately.
With an ectomorph frame, the risk is leaning too far into shoulders or wrists while testing depth. Keep the forearms strong and spine long, and avoid collapsing your hips straight down. Use the natural length to graze north wall at mid-depth without pressing cervix. For Flow into deep ten, you will need full lubrication, a slow tempo, and constant breath anchors—inhale on baseline reset, exhale through depth. Treat the deep zone like a room you only enter when invited. The most common mistake with above-average length is mistaking silence for permission; stay tuned for cues like her hips pressing back or a long exhale through the nose.
Reflection after each depth probe is essential. Return to shallow, let her body settle, and note what happened. Journal one sentence, for example, “North wall, mid depth, Medium pressure, hips curled in on rep two, pulled back after rep three.” Over time, these notes show which walls tolerate depth and which must remain shallow.
Your purpose in this module is not to turn deep access into routine, but to earn it by matching her body’s feedback. If you treat shallow as the canvas and deep as the accent, you will never overstay in a zone that risks discomfort. This balance lets you keep Flow alive while adding depth only where it amplifies sensation.

===================================================================================


Module 7 for the Harrare is centered on Pinning strategy, where the aim is to hold her in the afterglow of orgasm and spark additional waves through precise adjustments.
When she has reached climax, her canal often contracts, breath shifts into a softer rhythm, and her hips may still or curl inward. From your neutral forearm plank, keep the base load light through shoulders and wrists so that your hips can make micro-angle changes without strain. With a body type like ectomorph, conserving joint energy is key—keep the plank tight but not locked, letting your spine carry some of the load so you don’t over-fatigue arms. With above-seven-inch length, depth must be carefully gated; you’ll hover in the shallow and mid zones unless her body invites deeper entry through pelvic draw-in or a sigh that relaxes the canal.
The keystrokes of the Harrare become shorter and more deliberate now. Instead of sweeping wide diagonals, focus on narrowing them, almost like holding her between two compass points and rocking within that band. For example, if her cues showed the right wall as sensitive during Flow, you would rock hips lightly to keep the glans brushing that ridge, keeping pressure Medium and synced to an exhale. When her breath deepens or a pelvic curl pulls you in, you test slightly harder pressure on the same wall and observe whether the cue strengthens or weakens. This is the SSP loop in Pinning: observe the response, tweak angle or tempo, and test again without breaking rhythm.
Your penis size here amplifies sensation even with shallow entries, so you do not need to drive deep to trigger intensity. Think of it as fanning a flame rather than striking a spark—your job is to sustain what is already alive. A simple metaphor is holding her against the rail of a boat in gentle waves; the movement is not large, but the repetition on one point becomes overwhelming. She will likely show this by pressing her hips up, stilling her breath, or giving soft vocal release. Those are cues to keep the angle steady and maybe quicken tempo slightly.
To practice, run short sets of five to ten reps focusing on one compass wall, then reset fully to baseline before trying another. Journal in simple one-line shorthand, for example: “North-east shallow, Medium pressure, hips pressed back at rep six.” This lets you track which angles carry her further into multiples. For an ectomorph, remember to drop to knees between sets if forearm plank becomes too taxing, so you protect shoulders and wrists for longevity.

===================================================================================
Module 8 for the Harrare is about putting everything together into a four-week integration plan that makes the stroke second nature and safely sustainable for your body type.
Begin with orientation each session. For an ectomorph, always set the neutral forearm plank first, keeping elbows stacked under shoulders, wrists flat on the canvas, and hips aligned with spine. Because of longer limbs, fatigue can set in faster if joints are overextended. Spend the opening minutes simply holding plank, breathing in through the nose for four counts and exhaling through the mouth for six. This not only engrains posture but also builds stamina in the smaller stabilizers that keep your stroke clean. With above-seven-inch length, remind yourself here that depth must be chosen, not assumed. Your baseline is shallow eighty percent until her cues open the gate.
From there, your practice follows the keystroke map you already broke down. In week one, isolate the keystrokes in sets of ten reps, alternating hips with full resets. Journal simple one-line notes each set, for example: “Right wall, shallow, Medium, hips pressed back at rep seven.” These notes create feedback loops that train you to see how small angle and pressure shifts change her responses. Week two, begin chaining keystrokes into the full Harrare sequence, staying mostly in the shallow zone, no longer than five minutes at a time. For ectomorph recovery, rest two minutes between sets in a kneeling position to unload shoulders.
Week three is where Flow begins. Choose the wall that has given the clearest cues—perhaps a deeper exhale or pelvic curl—and run sustained chains of twenty to thirty reps. Use breath as your anchor: inhale on baseline, exhale through sweep. This phase is about endurance and keeping rhythm steady even as your body fatigues. Avoid rushing; your longer frame makes jerky strokes more likely if you lose tension in your plank. Reset whenever form drifts. By now, she should be consistently responding with stilling, hip draw-in, or soft vocalization when you hit the right compass line.
Week four introduces controlled depth testing. With your size, deep entry is never default. Instead, wait until her pelvis tilts or relaxes and test one rep at the mid-ten percent. If she receives it—through breath deepening, body softening, or hips staying open—stay for a short set of three reps before pulling back to shallow. If she resists, return fully to shallow without hesitation. This builds trust in your judgment and prevents overloading her cervix. Integration at this stage is about knowing when not to force. You are teaching your body to pair discipline with intensity, holding back until her cues open the door.
The overall plan is cumulative. Each week you build not just strength and clarity of stroke but also reliability of reading cues. The journaling shorthand stays the same, always one line per set, marking wall, angle, depth, pressure, and cue observed. By the end, you will have a written ledger of how her body speaks to this stroke and how your adjustments meet her.
