This module teaches how to set up your body to perform the Zig Zag stroke safely and powerfully. The focus is on grounding your forearms, controlling depth, and using breath to keep your rhythm steady. Begin in forearm plank, hips level with your shoulders, elbows under your chest. For an Endomorph body, spread your knees slightly wider to reduce lower back compression. Because your frame carries more mass, balance weight through your forearms and thighs rather than the spine. Let your abdomen hang relaxed so breath can move fully from diaphragm to pelvis. Keep your neck long, eyes down, jaw unclenched. The purpose of this setup is to build a stable baseline where each keystroke later lands cleanly without torque on the hips.
When your penis size is above seven inches, your depth potential can exceed most women’s comfortable range. The goal is not to prove reach but to manage it. In this neutral plank, your hips are the hinge, not your back. A forward press from this hinge determines depth. Train yourself to stop one finger-width before the full base enters. This limit keeps the shallow 80% zone as your home territory, preventing over-penetration and keeping sensation alive across her full canal. Think of this as docking a boat—approach until contact is firm, not forceful. Breath guides the throttle. Inhale to gather, exhale as you move forward, then pause to feel resistance.
The Rocking vs. Angling quality matters here. The Zig Zag stroke later relies on Angling, but for setup you must Rock first. Rocking is a straight front-to-back hinge where both hip points move in parallel lines toward her. This creates clean entry alignment. When Angling comes in later, one hip leads and the other follows, making the diagonal. For now, keep both hips even, pressing straight to test wall contact. Map this baseline at shallow 80%, mid 10%, and deep 10% zones through controlled entry. A slow three-count forward and backward keeps rhythm teachable. If her breath deepens or her hips pull in, you’ve found a comfortable wall to build on.
Pressure should always feel alive but safe. For Endomorphs, start with Light-to-Medium pressure because the body weight itself increases load. Your heavier frame translates into stronger thrust momentum even at low effort, so focus on finesse rather than force. Watch for her pelvis adjusting or a soft exhale; these are signals of relaxation and readiness. When pressure feels smooth, pause one full inhale in neutral before the next cycle. This neutral reset is not rest—it’s calibration. Use it to feel how your hips float, how your spine decompresses, and how her body receives your presence.
Depth control for an Above 7-inch size demands precision. Gate your reach by marking the shaft with a tactile cue—a ring of lube residue or a mental note of the stretch at comfortable mid-depth. Stay just shy of this point in training. Over time, the tissue around her cervix adapts, but the safety margin must remain. Inhale through the draw-back phase; exhale through the forward. Keep your abs softly braced to avoid belly collapse, which can drag your centerline off angle. If her breath halts or she tightens, pull back to mid and reset baseline.
Reflection after each short set is how you condition your nervous system. Rest your hips down, keep forearms planted, and feel how your breath moves through the whole length of your body. Journal one line such as, “Front Rock / Shallow / Light Pressure → Smooth@10.” This record anchors your sensory map for future refinement. Remember, your goal in this orientation phase is not to perform the Zig Zag yet but to become fluent in body setup and depth awareness so the stroke can later travel diagonally with no risk.

=============================================================================================


This module teaches you how to isolate and train the keystrokes that make up the Zig Zag stroke. Each keystroke is a specific body action that can be practiced alone before combining them into full rhythm. The Zig Zag relies on angled hip movement, alternating diagonals, and tight control of wall pressure, so your focus here is on separating the lateral and diagonal motions that form the pattern. Begin again in the forearm-plank baseline from Module 1—elbows under shoulders, hips aligned, breath steady. For an Endomorph body, widen your knee base slightly to reduce joint compression and distribute mass evenly. Your penis length means you’ll use smaller range motions to stay within shallow and mid zones safely.
The first keystroke is the Lateral Drag. It starts at the shallow 80% zone and moves side to side across the inner walls without advancing depth. The action is a small Rocking motion with a subtle Angling of the hips. Lead with your right hip diagonally forward while your left hip subtly retracts, creating a crosswise sweep from right anterior wall to left posterior wall. The motion should feel like wiping a curved surface gently, not sawing. Inhale as you start the shift, exhale through the drag, then inhale again as you return to center. Her cues for success are small pelvic twitches, deepened breathing, or soft internal suction. Maintain Light pressure for the first few cycles, Medium once her hips start to answer.
The second keystroke is the Diagonal Pushout. This begins from neutral at mid-depth and angles one hip forward to drive diagonally toward the upper-left wall, then back toward the lower-right wall. Unlike the Drag, the Pushout uses slightly more hip torque. For your heavier Endomorph frame, keep core engaged to protect your lower back and move from hips, not spine. Because your length exceeds average, limit forward travel to nine-tenths of full insertion. Inhale to coil back, exhale to press diagonally forward, and hold a micro-pause at the point of wall contact to feel the push feedback. She may curl her pelvis or whisper a low hum when you hit a receptive line—these are accurate cues that you’ve aligned to her internal spiral.
The third keystroke is the Anchor Reset. It returns your body to baseline after lateral or diagonal motion. From the end of any push or drag, flex your glutes slightly, draw the hips back until you feel a drop in pressure, and hold neutral for one full inhale. This reset prevents your rhythm from collapsing and clears sensory noise. The temptation for an Endomorph is to skip this reset due to momentum, but it’s essential for training stamina and clarity. Think of it as re-centering the compass before changing direction. Keep your abs gently tight, shoulders low, and feel how the pressure dissipates evenly.
The fourth keystroke is the Tilt Shift. It’s a micro-angling action where one hip lowers while the other rises. The Tilt Shift prepares your body for the crossing motion that defines the Zig Zag. Practice it by lowering your right hip slightly as the left rises, then reversing on the next breath. Stay shallow at 80% to avoid cervical contact. This keystroke teaches pelvic independence—each side moves freely without losing full-body control. When she exhales with a soft sigh or her inner muscles flutter, you’ve matched her body rhythm.
Cycle each keystroke for five to six breaths, then rest one full inhale at neutral baseline. This keeps your muscles fresh and your proprioception sharp. For your body type, avoid forcing deeper angles when fatigue builds; joint load rises quickly with mass. Let breath and timing carry the movement instead of muscle power. Over time, these isolated keystrokes build memory for the pattern’s diagonal travel. After training, record one journal line such as “Lateral Drag / Shallow / Medium Pressure → Steady@12.” This captures progress and precision.

=============================================================================================




This module teaches you how to assemble the Zig Zag stroke by chaining the keystrokes into one continuous rhythm. You’re no longer isolating movements but linking them in a precise flow. Start in the forearm-plank baseline with your spine long, hips level, and shoulders relaxed. The logic of the Zig Zag is built on alternating diagonals—each motion crosses the internal compass of her canal while maintaining constant wall contact. Think of it as tracing an invisible lightning path from one upper corner to the opposite lower one, then reversing in rhythm. This stroke creates deep stimulation on the north and northeast walls while sweeping sensation across her full inner terrain.
Begin with a single Lateral Drag from right to left, keeping the head of your penis gliding just under the surface of the north wall. Inhale to prepare, then exhale through the side shift. As you reach the far edge, transition directly into a Diagonal Pushout—drive your right hip diagonally forward toward her upper-left quadrant while maintaining contact on the north wall. The motion combines Rocking from the core with Angling from the hips, staying in the shallow 80% zone for the first few sets. Keep pressure Medium to Light to allow smooth directional change. When her breath hitches or her hips begin to follow your angle, you’re in sync.
Next, return through the opposing diagonal. Draw the hips back and slightly down as if sketching the reverse lightning path. You’ll feel a subtle twisting of your abdomen; keep it controlled, not forceful. The Anchor Reset comes at the end of every two diagonals. Pull back gently to neutral, inhale, hold one second, and sense how the pressure clears before beginning the next sequence. The Tilt Shift naturally enters here—one hip lowers as the other rises, setting the angle for the next Lateral Drag. This alternating rhythm—Drag, Pushout, Reset, Tilt—is the beating heart of the Zig Zag. Each motion overlaps the next so the pattern feels fluid to her body but distinct to your muscles.
For your Endomorph frame, focus on precision over range. Use the weight of your hips rather than thrust power. Your mass gives natural compression; use it sparingly to prevent fatigue. Because your penis length exceeds seven inches, gate your forward travel to just under full insertion. Keep your energy in the middle 10% zone only when her cues clearly show readiness—a long exhale, a pelvic curl, or a deep pull of her hips toward you. Return to shallow rhythm the moment tension spikes. The Zig Zag rewards endurance and finesse more than depth.
Breathe through each full crossing cycle—inhale during the Drag, exhale during the Pushout, inhale again at Reset. This pacing keeps your nervous system calm and your pelvic floor relaxed. As rhythm improves, the motion will feel like a pendulum tracing diagonals through water—continuous, suspended, and directed. The SSP mindset applies here: Define your wall target, Hypothesize your best angle, Track her body’s response, and Refine each repetition. After a session, record a journal note in simple shorthand such as “Zig Zag / North wall / Medium pressure → hips follow@8.” This will mark where her engagement peaked.

=============================================================================================


This module teaches you how to run the Zig Zag stroke through its first tracking phase, where every motion is measured and refined in the shallow 80% zone. You’re no longer just building the stroke—you’re testing it. Think of this as the scientist’s phase of sex training: define your hypothesis, observe her reactions, refine your adjustments. Begin in the forearm-plank baseline, hips aligned, weight balanced between forearms and thighs. For an Endomorph, widen the knee stance slightly again to reduce knee torque and let your abdominal mass hang freely for breath expansion. Keep your pelvis neutral until movement begins, then let the diagonal patterns from Module 3 emerge slowly, like a slow scan across her walls.
Start your first test set at shallow depth, about four-fifths of your full length, using Light pressure to let her canal dictate shape. Run a slow Zig Zag—right-up to left-down, left-up to right-down—at half your normal pace for ten breaths. Keep Rocking steady from your hips, not your spine, and let Angling happen naturally as one hip leads the cross. The purpose here is to track feedback: feel which wall grips, which wall releases, and how her pelvis answers. When her breathing quickens or she lets a quiet hum slip, that’s your data confirming alignment. If she stiffens or draws away, mark that diagonal as too deep or steep.
Pause after each short test series to Anchor Reset. Pull back until the pressure drops to zero, hold one breath, then journal mentally: “North wall smooth@6” or “Left drag too sharp@4.” Each note helps you map her internal topography. For your body type, endurance matters more than speed—each adjustment should be small enough to repeat without strain. Your heavier frame builds pressure quickly, so stay in Light-to-Medium intensity and rest your hips down every twenty cycles to protect joint load. Because your penis length is above seven inches, never exceed the shallow band during tracking; this protects her cervix while you learn her angles.
The SSP loop governs your process here: Define a wall or diagonal target, Hypothesize the right pressure and angle, Track her cues for five to six repetitions, and Refine by adjusting either wall direction or tempo. Her visible cues are your test results: a deeper pelvic roll signals pleasure alignment, while stillness or breath-holding shows overload. Your job isn’t to force response but to read it. Think of each diagonal like tuning a string instrument—tiny twists, subtle pressure changes, listening for resonance. Over time, you’ll learn her body’s unique diagonal preference—the exact angle that draws her into rhythm without resistance.
Keep breathing through every cycle: inhale as you draw back, exhale as you cross forward. This breath anchors your nervous system so your perception sharpens instead of dulls with arousal. The shallow tracking stage also strengthens your pelvic control, as each small correction teaches fine motor stability. After about ten minutes of practice, shift to neutral, rest your forearms, and take a long exhale. Let your mind register what felt smooth, what felt blocked, and what surprised you. Journal one clear line: “Zig Zag / Shallow / North-East diagonal / Medium pressure → pelvic curl@9.” That note becomes your calibration point for future sessions.

=============================================================================================




This module teaches you how to enter and sustain the Flow phase of the Zig Zag—where the movement becomes continuous, breath-matched, and self-correcting. Flow is the state between awareness and instinct. You’ve tracked angles and walls; now your goal is to let rhythm merge with her body’s timing while maintaining perfect control. Begin in forearm-plank baseline, spine long, chest hovering just above hers, your weight balanced through your core. For an Endomorph, maintain the wide knee stance from earlier modules to stabilize mass and protect your hips. Your frame gives you power—Flow demands you soften that power into precision.
Start shallow at 80%, tracing the same diagonal pattern you discovered during tracking. This first minute is entry tempo—slow, even Rocking from the hips with gentle Angling as one side of your pelvis dips forward and the other retracts. Think of the movement like sweeping a paintbrush across a curved wall—smooth, unbroken, always in contact. Inhale to gather, exhale through the cross, inhale to return. As rhythm stabilizes, your nervous system syncs to her cadence. Watch for the first signs of Flow ignition: her breathing evens out with yours, her hips begin to echo your diagonals instead of resisting, and her inner walls start to draw you in without your thrust.
Stay primarily in the shallow 80% zone for the first several minutes. With your above-average length, this keeps stimulation broad and safe. Let Medium pressure dominate with brief Light phases at the start of each directional change. When her body starts to pull inward, that’s your signal to increase depth slightly—no more than the mid 10%. The transition from shallow to mid happens not by pushing but by allowing her pelvic curl to invite you. Inhale during the backward glide, exhale into the mid zone, and sustain pressure only for a heartbeat before gliding out. Flow is continuous; any pause should feel like suspension, not stop.
Because of your Endomorph leverage, focus on controlling descent rather than acceleration. Let your hips float just above the canvas at full extension to preserve joint load. The feeling should be weightless even as pressure builds. When her hips rise to meet you or her breath deepens into a moan, you’ve matched her neurological rhythm—she’s riding the same wave you’re tracing. Maintain this pattern for a few breath cycles, then pull back to shallow and reset pressure to Light. This pulsing between zones—shallow, mid, shallow—is what keeps Flow alive and prevents sensory fatigue.
Flow phase is where trust and control meet. Your task is to hold tempo steady while allowing micro-variations to evolve naturally. The SSP loop stays alive even in Flow: Observe her reactions, Tweak your angle by a few degrees, Test by sustaining the shift for four to five breaths. If her body opens further, stay there; if she tightens, return to the previous diagonal. Think of yourself as conducting her internal rhythm, adjusting volume without breaking the song. The perfect Flow feels like breathing together inside motion—her inner walls ripple, her exhale aligns with your stroke, and the world narrows to pulse and sound.
When the session ends, always Anchor Reset: pull back until pressure drops, breathe twice at baseline, and let sensation drain out of your hips before resting on your knees. Record one clean journal line such as “Zig Zag / Flow / Shallow→Mid / Medium pressure → hips mirror@7.” This becomes your signature metric for Flow mastery and the foundation for deeper phases later.

=============================================================================================




This module teaches you how to safely explore the deep 10% zone of the Zig Zag stroke—the phase where Flow expands into depth without collapse. Deep work is not about penetration for its own sake; it’s about precision under pressure. Begin in the same forearm-plank baseline, with your spine long and hips just suspended above the canvas. For an Endomorph, let your knees stay slightly wider than your hips to free your abdomen and prevent lumbar compression. Because your penis length is above seven inches, this phase demands absolute depth control. Every descent must be guided by breath and awareness, not force.
Start from shallow rhythm in the 80% zone, Light pressure, steady Rocking. As she begins to open—hips drawing inward, exhale softening—initiate your descent. The action is not a thrust but a controlled glide down the north diagonal, guided by your core. Inhale to prepare, then exhale as you extend, keeping the top shelf of your shaft grazing the north wall. The moment you feel cervix contact or pelvic resistance, freeze pressure. That’s your boundary marker. Never chase past it. Instead, tilt your hips a few degrees southward to redirect stimulation into the upper northeast wall. This Angling transfers depth intensity into lateral texture, maintaining pleasure without blunt impact.
Sustain Medium pressure during descent, then drop to Light as you reverse the diagonal and extract. The combination of Rocking and Angling keeps stimulation broad even at depth. The key is rhythm containment: two breaths down, one breath up, full reset after every third cycle. Her body will tell you everything—if she sighs, curls her pelvis, or tightens her thighs around you, you’re aligned. If she stiffens or holds her breath, that’s your signal to return to mid or shallow. Deep work is only successful when she remains fluid under it. The moment resistance appears, back off and reestablish the shallow pattern.
Your Endomorph leverage amplifies pressure at depth, so use your core rather than your hips to control entry. Imagine your pelvis as an elevator platform descending one floor, not a piston. The muscles around your navel guide the motion while your glutes stabilize. This allows you to ride depth without driving it. Keep your shoulders relaxed and wrists planted evenly; if your weight tilts forward, it will force unintentional depth and strain your partner’s cervix. Think of it as sculpting with weightless clay—your strength is containment, not impact.
The SSP loop in this stage operates as Observe → Tweak → Test. Observe her breath and pelvic rhythm, Tweak your angle by two to five degrees, Test with three controlled cycles. The purpose is to find the deepest sustainable wall where pressure feels enveloping but not sharp. Because your length can fill her completely, you must learn to hold intensity steady instead of increasing it. Sustained medium pressure at depth often produces spontaneous contractions or involuntary pelvic curls—these are your “yes” cues. If her body goes still or trembles, that’s saturation; pull out to shallow and start a recovery rhythm.
Throughout the deep exploration, lubrication must be actively maintained. Pause after every ten cycles, Anchor Reset, and let your penis rest at shallow depth while you both breathe. This restores sensitivity and blood flow, preventing numbness or irritation. Your breath remains the guide: inhale on withdrawal, exhale gently through descent, staying connected to her body’s micro-adjustments. Endomorph mass gives natural stability—use it to float above pressure rather than driving into it. Your endurance is your precision.
At the end of this module, return to baseline and rest your hips fully on the canvas. Take two long breaths, release tension from shoulders to thighs, and let awareness sink back into your body. Record one line: “Zig Zag / Deep / North diagonal / Medium pressure → pelvic curl@5.” That shorthand confirms your sustainable depth for future sessions and keeps safety built into your rhythm memory.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for Zig Zag with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


=============================================================================================


This module teaches you how to use the Zig Zag stroke as a post-orgasm ignition system—Pinning. Here you enter the SSP loop in its most delicate form: Observe, Tweak, and Test micro-changes to reawaken sensitivity and trigger multiple waves. It’s not about speed or thrusting; it’s about wielding stillness with precision. Begin from forearm-plank baseline, both bodies pressed and aligned, her hips relaxed under your weight. Your breathing must be slow and intentional—inhale through your nose, exhale through your mouth, grounding your nervous system so your body stays sensitive rather than collapsing after climax.
As you resume motion, start at shallow 80%, Light pressure, running the same diagonal path as in Flow but reduced to half amplitude. Each Zig Zag sweep should feel like tracing her inner walls with a fingertip rather than a stroke. The Rocking motion becomes smaller, almost invisible; Angling becomes your main driver. Tilt your pelvis along each diagonal, letting the top surface of your shaft glide from northeast to southwest, then reverse. The goal is to maintain friction and contact while reducing forward thrust to almost zero. This creates rhythmic stimulation without overwhelming her overstimulated nerves.
In the Pinning phase, breath and timing replace power. On the inhale, pause at the shallow apex, letting your shaft rest just inside. On the exhale, let your pelvis tilt down five degrees, spreading pressure evenly across her north wall. This subtle rocking keeps her body engaged and your erection stable. Watch for her cues: a quivering thigh, a sudden breath release, or a drawn-out exhale. These signs mean her sensitivity has reignited and you can gently increase amplitude to mid 10%. Never exceed Medium pressure here; your length will amplify every micro-shift. Deep re-entry after climax can overwhelm her nervous system—stay shallow and rhythmic instead.
As sensation builds again, use the SSP loop consciously. Observe her breath and pelvic micro-movements, Tweak by adjusting angle or tempo slightly, and Test for two or three breath cycles. If her hips rise to meet you, maintain that variation; if she holds her breath or flinches, reset to your baseline diagonal. Endomorph stability gives you an advantage here—you can hover above her without collapsing, using body weight to maintain gentle contact without strain. Your mass becomes anchorage, not pressure. Think of your hips as a metronome swinging in smaller and smaller arcs until you’re pulsing rather than thrusting.
When she begins to tremble or exhale sharply, sustain your motion for two more breaths, then hold—no movement, just presence. This is the Pin. Your stillness, combined with her contractions, creates the second release. Keep your breath matched to hers, exhaling as she does. Afterward, pull out slowly to shallow depth, rest, and let both bodies go slack. Record one clear journal note: “Zig Zag / Pinning / Shallow diagonal / Light pressure → tremor@8.” This confirms the cue sequence that sparked her second climax and trains your nervous system to recognize it.

=============================================================================================
This module integrates everything you’ve learned about the Zig Zag stroke into a sustainable four-week practice plan. The purpose now is mastery through repetition, precision, and rest. By this stage, your body already understands the mechanics—your goal is consistency under different levels of arousal and fatigue. Training is about nervous-system conditioning, not chasing intensity. Each session starts in the same neutral forearm-plank position you’ve refined: spine long, core engaged, wrists under shoulders, hips balanced. For an Endomorph, continue using the wide-knee stance to offload weight from your lower back and maintain freedom of motion. Because your penis length is above seven inches, depth control remains your top safeguard—stay within shallow to mid most days, saving deep exploration for recovery weeks.
Across week one, your practice centers on perfecting baseline and shallow rhythm at 80%. Keep every stroke light to medium pressure, two breaths per cycle, twenty cycles per set. Focus on breathing and posture, not performance. She may feel this as a teasing rhythm—a continuous wave that builds arousal without saturation. Watch for subtle cues: hips following your diagonals, a softening belly, her exhale syncing with yours. When these appear, stay steady rather than pushing further. End each set with an Anchor Reset—hips drop, shoulders release, two full breaths before restarting. Journal simple cues like “Shallow / north wall / medium pressure → breath sync@6.” These entries train your pattern recognition and help refine future sessions.
Week two shifts toward mid-zone Flow. Here you alternate shallow and mid-depth sequences—five shallow cycles followed by one mid insertion. The aim is to learn modulation, how to carry rhythm across depth without breaking tempo. Because of your size, limit mid-depth to Medium pressure and reduce cycle length if her breath sharpens. The Endomorph advantage is endurance—use your weight as stabilizing ballast, gliding rather than pushing. Her body will start to anticipate your diagonals; Flow occurs when her hips lead and yours follow for a few cycles before you reassert direction. When that happens, slow tempo slightly and ride it. Record each night’s best rhythm with a one-line tag to lock the feel into muscle memory.
Week three introduces deep-zone precision. You’ll only access the deep 10% for short test sequences—no more than five cycles per session. Warm up with shallow-mid Flow until you sense her readiness through pelvic curl and exhale release. Enter on the breath, maintain Medium pressure, and retreat cleanly when her body tightens. This week teaches you cervix awareness, not dominance. Deep work sharpens your proprioception; her subtle contractions and warmth shifts become your compass. Each descent is a data point. Note sensations such as “Deep / NE diagonal / light-medium pressure → pelvic curl@3.” This trains your SSP decision-making for future precision at depth.
Week four consolidates everything through Flow-to-Pinning transitions. Begin each session with a five-minute Flow sequence in the shallow-mid range, then reduce amplitude and slide into Pinning rhythm—small, angled glides with controlled breath. You’re learning to maintain energy after climax, transforming stamina into mastery. Keep rest hygiene strict: after every thirty cycles, rest hips on the canvas, inhale deeply twice, exhale tension through your arms. This resets circulation and prevents joint overload. As an Endomorph, hydration and stretching between sessions are vital; tension gathers quickly in hips and lower back if neglected.
Across all weeks, the essential habit is reflection. After each session, write one sentence of observation and one of intention. The pattern could read, “Mid-flow steadier tonight → keep lighter angle tomorrow.” These short reflections build awareness loops stronger than repetition alone. Remember, mastery grows during rest as much as practice. The Zig Zag rewards patience—the rhythm teaches control, and control becomes presence. When your body learns to shift pressure and depth with unconscious precision, every stroke feels deliberate and effortless at once. That is the moment Flow turns to art.
