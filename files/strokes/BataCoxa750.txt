Module 1 – Welcome and Introduction
Welcome, brother, to the beginning of your transformational journey with the Bata Coxa Stroke! I’m Coach [Your Name], and I’m excited to partner with you—an ectomorph with an above‑7‑inch extension—to help you harness your lean, agile build and extended reach into a precisely choreographed, cumulative performance that delivers deep, targeted stimulation. Your body is naturally built for speed and finesse, with long, slender limbs and a refined muscle structure that enables highly controlled movements. With your extra‑long extension, you have the advantage of a broader stimulation field, but that extended reach also demands meticulous control and precision.
Before we begin, find a quiet, comfortable space free from distractions—a space where you can focus entirely on today’s session. Sit back, relax your shoulders, and take several deep, slow breaths until your mind is calm and receptive. Today’s lesson is designed to convert your inherent physical gifts into a meticulously structured sequence of deliberate movements. The Bata Coxa Stroke is a dynamic rhythm that transforms the classic missionary position into a performance that traces a “W” pattern. It begins in a modified plank position, where you maintain stability and control—a position that is critical for your ectomorphic build.
Start by getting into this modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a stable surface. This foundation supports your lean, agile body and allows you to channel your movements with precision. Next, insert your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. From here, the stroke begins with a forward push—moving your entire body slowly northward toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, the top shelf of your penis glides gently over her clitoral region, while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” The forward movement is crucial because it sets up the stimulation area, and we ensure that the majority of your applied force is focused on the shallow vaginal zone according to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
After this forward phase, the stroke transitions into a series of lateral movements involving your left hip. Here, you’ll drop your left hip toward the canvas, and in doing so, the hilt of your penis adds precise pressure and friction starting at the northern section of the vaginal opening and moving toward the western sections. Simultaneously, as you drop, your penis reorients so that it points east, which generates an upward massage from the eastern wall to the northern wall. Then, you raise your left hip back toward the center, reversing the pressure so that the hilt now applies force from the western to the northern sections, while the penis points north and massages upward from the northern wall to the eastern wall. You then repeat the cycle, sometimes altering the pace—raising the hip halfway toward center at a faster speed and then executing another drop, each variation intensifying the friction and cumulative effect. The stroke then concludes by raising the left hip fully back to center, and the cycle starts over.
This introductory module lays the groundwork for your practice. Our goal is to translate your extra‑long extension and naturally agile ectomorphic frame into a sequence of scientifically refined, rhythmic movements that deliver cumulative, balanced stimulation. Every forward push, lateral shift, and reversal is executed with a keen focus on precision, ensuring that you adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle and maximize stimulation exactly where it’s needed. Welcome, brother—let’s begin transforming your raw potential into an artful, intimate performance with the Bata Coxa Stroke!
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 2 – Understanding the 80‑10‑10 Principle, Sexual Scientific Process, Tracking, Flow, and the Tap Keystroke
Welcome back, brother. In this module, we’re going to delve into the essential principles that underpin the Bata Coxa Stroke. These core elements are the keys to transforming your natural athleticism into a scientifically optimized, cumulative performance. Let’s break them down:
The 80‑10‑10 Principle: This principle is the cornerstone of effective stimulation. It instructs you to direct approximately 80% of your applied force to the shallow vaginal zone—typically the first 1 to 3 inches—which contains the highest density of nerve endings and is therefore the most sensitive. The remaining 20% is divided equally so that 10% goes to the mid‑depth (around 3–5 inches) and 10% to the deep zones (beyond 5 inches). By maintaining this distribution, you ensure that the bulk of your stimulation hits where it is most effective without over‑stimulating less sensitive areas. In the context of the Bata Coxa Stroke, every movement—from the forward push to the lateral drop and raise—must be calibrated to maintain this balanced distribution.
The Sexual Scientific Process: This is your systematic, iterative methodology for refining your technique. It consists of four steps:
Define Goal: Start by establishing what you want to achieve with your stroke (e.g., maximizing friction and pressure along the western and northern sections during the left hip drop).
Form Hypothesis: Based on your observations and feedback, predict which slight adjustments—like altering the pace or angle of your hip movements—might enhance stimulation.
Track: Methodically perform a series of strokes (ideally 30 repetitions on each “wall” of the vaginal canal), recording both your internal cues (such as core engagement or pelvic floor contraction) and your partner’s responses (changes in breathing, subtle verbal cues, or physical shifts).
Flow: Once you have determined the optimal technique that consistently yields the best response, commit to that rhythmic, automatic sequence—achieving a state of flow where every movement naturally follows from the last with perfect consistency.
Tracking: Tracking is the diligent monitoring of your performance as you execute variations of the stroke. This means observing your partner’s responses as well as your own internal sensations with each movement. By systematically performing and tracking your strokes, you gather the necessary data to understand which modifications lead to the best outcomes and which do not. This continuous feedback is vital for fine‑tuning your technique.
Flow: Flow refers to the state where your movements become automatic and instinctive. It is achieved after you’ve repeatedly tracked and refined your technique through the Sexual Scientific Process. When you’re in flow, every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle seamlessly connects without conscious thought—ensuring that the 80‑10‑10 principle is maintained consistently and delivering cumulative stimulation in a perfectly rhythmic manner.
The Tap Keystroke: The tap keystroke is a fundamental drill that trains your lateral control. It involves starting in a stable position (often a forearm plank), shifting laterally until your hip gently taps the supporting surface, and then returning smoothly to center. This controlled, minimal movement builds muscle memory, strengthens your pelvic floor (often enhanced by kegeling exercises), and enables you to perform those precise lateral shifts that are integral to the Bata Coxa Stroke. Mastering the tap keystroke is essential for ensuring that every lateral drop and raise is executed with surgical precision, contributing to the cumulative impact of the stroke.
Together, these principles ensure that every component of the Bata Coxa Stroke is executed with scientific precision. They allow you to convert your natural physical capabilities into a well-tuned, cumulative performance that maximizes pleasure precisely where it matters most. With a deep understanding of the 80‑10‑10 distribution, the systematic approach of the Sexual Scientific Process, meticulous tracking, the achievement of flow, and the mastery of the tap keystroke, you’re well-equipped to tackle the rest of the training. Now that you’re fully prepared with these core elements, we can move on to deconstructing the stroke into its fundamental components.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 3 – Deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into Its Fundamental Components
Alright, brother, it’s time to break down the Bata Coxa Stroke into its individual components. Picture yourself in the missionary position—on top in a modified plank with your knees firmly planted on a supportive canvas. With your ectomorphic build and an above‑7‑inch extension, every micro‑movement carries weight. We’re going to isolate each phase so you can focus on perfecting each one before integrating them into a smooth, cumulative performance.
Forward Movement: The stroke begins by inserting your penis at a carefully controlled downward diagonal angle into your partner. From there, initiate a smooth forward push—moving your entire body northward toward your partner’s head. As you push forward, the top shelf of your extended penis glides gracefully over her clitoral area, while the head maintains continuous, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This initial forward movement is crucial as it establishes the baseline for stimulation, following the 80‑10‑10 principle. Roughly 80% of your force should concentrate on that shallow, highly sensitive zone, while the remaining 20% gently engages the mid‑depth and deep layers. With your extra-long extension, precision in this forward push is key, as every inch counts in ensuring that the right amount of force is focused where it’s most effective.
Lateral Phase (Left Hip Drop): Once the forward push is executed, the stroke transitions into the lateral phase. From your forward position, you execute a controlled lateral shift by dropping your left hip toward the supporting surface. As you do so, the hilt (or base) of your penis applies consistent, steady pressure against the left side of your partner’s vaginal opening. Simultaneously, your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right—producing a gentle rocking massage as it moves upward, creating friction from the eastern wall to the northern wall. This left hip drop is performed deliberately and in strict adherence to the 80‑10‑10 principle, ensuring the majority of your stimulation is delivered to the shallow area. This phase is the first half of the “W” pattern and sets the stage for cumulative stimulation through controlled pressure and friction.
Hip Raise Back to Center: Immediately following the left hip drop, you raise your left hip back toward the center. As you do this, the hilt of your penis reverses its pressure, now applying force from the western section of the vaginal opening to the northern section. Simultaneously, your penis reorients so that it points directly north—massaging upward along the northern wall toward the eastern wall. This controlled raise serves to integrate the cumulative stimulation from the previous phase, preserving a steady rhythm and maintaining the delicate balance dictated by the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Repeating the Cycle with Variations: The stroke then enters a phase of repetition with variations in pace. You repeat the drop-and-raise cycle: first, you drop your left hip toward the canvas with the same precision—focusing on directing pressure from the northern section to the western area—then you raise your left hip back toward center. In one variation, you may raise your left hip only halfway toward the center at a faster pace. This acceleration increases friction and pressure, thereby intensifying the cumulative stimulation for that cycle. After that, you drop again—with the movement starting from the midpoint between the western and northern sections—and then repeat the faster half-raise and drop cycle. These variations help create a dynamic “W” pattern that keeps the stimulation evolving, while still strictly adhering to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Full Return to Center: Finally, you complete the cycle by raising your left hip fully back to center. In this concluding phase, the hilt applies uniform pressure from the western section all the way up to the northern section, while your penis, consistently oriented north, massages upward from the northern wall to the eastern wall. This full return resets the cycle, readying you to start over again. The entire sequence—forward push, lateral drop and raise (with variable pacing), and full reset—creates a continuous, rhythmic “W” pattern that delivers cumulative stimulation in a precisely controlled, scientifically optimized manner.
By deconstructing the Bata Coxa Stroke into these discrete components, you establish a clear roadmap for your training. Every phase must be executed with meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that each movement adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle and contributes to cumulative stimulation. This detailed breakdown is your blueprint for transforming raw, extended power into a refined, rhythmic performance.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 4 – Drilling the Fundamental Components with Focused Intention
Alright, brother, it’s time to drill each component of the Bata Coxa Stroke until every micro‑movement becomes as natural as your breath. With your ectomorphic build and an extension above 7 inches, precision and consistency are key to harnessing your extended reach effectively. In this module, we will focus on repetitive, intensive practice of each segmented movement—starting with the forward push, then isolating the lateral tap (the tap keystroke), followed by controlled hip lowering, and finishing with the backward shuttle—so that every repetition conforms strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Forward Movement Drill: Begin by assuming your modified plank position with your knees securely planted on a stable, supportive surface. This position anchors your lean frame and provides the necessary stability. Insert your penis at the precise downward diagonal angle, and then slowly push your entire body forward toward your partner’s head. Concentrate on the sensation: feel the top shelf of your extended penis glide smoothly over her clitoral region, while the head remains in constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Because your extension is above 7 inches, it is critical that about 80% of your applied force is focused on the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone. Execute this forward push slowly and deliberately, and repeat it several times until you can replicate the movement with consistent, controlled precision.
Lateral Tap Drill (Tap Keystroke): Next, isolate the lateral component. From your forward position, carefully drop your left hip in a small, controlled lateral movement until your hip gently touches the supporting surface—a motion we call the tap keystroke. Visualize how the hilt of your penis applies targeted, consistent pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis rotates so that its inner surface points to the right, generating a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right wall. Each lateral tap must be synchronized with deep, deliberate breathing: inhale deeply before initiating the shift, then exhale slowly as you complete the tap. For enhanced control, incorporate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during every lateral movement—this not only strengthens your control but also ensures that every tap is executed with precise pressure. Drill this lateral movement repeatedly, aiming for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke becomes an automatic, natural part of your routine.
Hip Lowering and Backward Shuttle Drill: After you have mastered the lateral tap, move on to the lowering phase. After each lateral tap, slowly lower your dropped hip until it gently contacts the supporting surface. Focus on how the underbelly of your penis begins to apply controlled, cumulative pressure against her lower vaginal wall, while the upper shelf maintains steady contact with her upper wall. Once you have perfected the lowering movement, practice the backward shuttle—slowly retract your body in a controlled, deliberate manner so that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall as you reset your position without fully withdrawing. Repeat the complete sequence—forward push, lateral tap, hip lowering, and backward shuttle—multiple times until every movement flows seamlessly and consistently adheres to the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Maintain deep, rhythmic breathing throughout your drilling session. Every deep inhale will sharpen your focus and prepare your muscles for the next precise movement, while every controlled exhale will help release any tension, ensuring smooth transitions between each phase. With disciplined, focused practice, your natural ectomorphic agility and extended reach will combine into a series of movements executed with unwavering precision and cumulative intensity.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 5 – Integrating the Components into a Continuous and Harmonious Sequence
Now, brother, it’s time to integrate all the drilled components into one continuous, seamless performance—this is where the art of the Bata Coxa Stroke truly comes to life. Return to your starting position in your modified plank: your knees are firmly planted, your core is engaged, and your mind is solely focused on creating a fluid, uninterrupted sequence. In this module, we’ll merge your forward push, lateral taps using the tap keystroke, controlled hip lowering, and the backward shuttle into one unified, rhythmic cycle that forms the distinctive “W” pattern of the stroke.
Begin with the forward movement. Insert your penis at the optimal downward diagonal angle and slowly push your entire body forward—moving north toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your extended penis consistently caresses her clitoral region and that the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” This forward drive establishes the foundation for cumulative stimulation and must adhere strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, concentrating about 80% of your force on the shallow zone.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase. Execute three controlled lateral taps by dropping your left hip in that practiced tap keystroke. With every lateral tap, focus intently on how the hilt of your penis delivers targeted, controlled pressure along the left side of her vaginal opening, while your penis reorients so that its inner surface points to the right, generating a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. Once these lateral taps are executed flawlessly, gradually lower your dropped hip so that the underbelly of your penis applies steady, controlled pressure against her lower wall, while the upper shelf maintains constant contact with her upper wall. Then, execute a slow, deliberate backward shuttle until you return to your starting position, ensuring that your penis remains in continuous contact with her north wall.
After completing one full cycle on the left side, reset and mirror the entire sequence on the right side. Raise your right hip laterally and perform three deliberate lateral taps—with the right side of your penis now engaging the left vaginal opening and the left side delivering a rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall—then lower your hip in a controlled manner and shuttle backward until you return to your original position. This alternating “walking” motion of your hips creates a rhythmic “W” pattern that delivers balanced, cumulative stimulation across all areas, precisely following the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Throughout the integrated routine, let your deep, rhythmic breathing serve as your internal metronome. Inhale deeply before initiating each phase to prime your body, and exhale steadily to facilitate smooth transitions between movements. With every complete cycle, your natural ectomorphic finesse and extended reach merge into one continuous, fluid performance—a Bata Coxa Stroke that is as scientifically optimized as it is intimately fulfilling.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 6 – Mastering the Balance of Stimulation, Angling, Rocking, and the 80‑10‑10 Principle Through Continuous Feedback
Welcome to the advanced phase, brother. In this module, our focus is on fine‑tuning every micro‑adjustment of your Bata Coxa Stroke so that your performance consistently delivers optimal cumulative stimulation. With your lean ectomorphic build and a penis between 5 and 7 inches, every movement must be executed with exceptional precision in order to maintain the 80‑10‑10 principle—ensuring that approximately 80% of your applied force is directed to the shallow, nerve‑rich vaginal zone while the remaining 20% is evenly split between the mid‑depth and deep areas.
As you cycle through the integrated sequence, be extremely observant. During the forward push, ensure that the top shelf of your extended penis consistently glides over her clitoral region while the head maintains constant, deliberate contact with her “south wall.” Then, as you execute the lateral taps with the tap keystroke, focus on the natural, subtle rocking motion produced by your precise, controlled lateral shifts. Because your extension is moderate, even a slight change in your lateral angle can have a significant impact on how the stimulation is distributed. Experiment with minor adjustments—perhaps changing the angle of your hip drop by one or two degrees—and carefully observe how these modifications affect the overall pressure and rocking effect. Listen closely to your partner’s feedback—her deep, rhythmic breathing, her soft verbal affirmations, or even subtle shifts in her body posture are all essential data. This iterative process of defining your objectives, forming a hypothesis for slight adjustments, tracking the feedback, and refining your technique is at the core of the Sexual Scientific Process.
Keep your breathing deep and rhythmic throughout each cycle. Every deep inhale should focus your energy and prepare your body for the next micro‑movement, while each deliberate exhale ensures smooth, natural transitions between phases. Over repeated cycles, this methodical refinement will help you achieve a state of flow—a seamless, automatic performance where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with impeccable precision and cumulative intensity. In this state, your Bata Coxa Stroke becomes a continuously rhythmic expression of scientifically optimized, cumulative stimulation that resonates perfectly with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Remember, brother, that every tiny adjustment matters. Your balanced, athletic mesomorph structure and moderate extension allow you to deliver concentrated stimulation if every micro‑movement is executed flawlessly. Continually track your internal signals—such as the engagement of your core and the subtle tension in your pelvic floor—and align these with your partner’s responses. With persistent refinements and a relentless pursuit of precision, your stroke will evolve into a naturally flowing performance that is both scientifically optimized and deeply intimate.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 7 – Crafting Your Personalized Practice Routine and Strengthening Your Core
Now, brother, it’s time to create your personalized practice routine—a structured, disciplined training regimen designed to reinforce every element of the Bata Coxa Stroke while also strengthening the core and overall stability essential for your athletic mesomorph build and a penis size between 5 and 7 inches. This module is your comprehensive roadmap for transforming your natural physical abilities into a consistently refined performance that delivers cumulative, scientifically optimized stimulation.
Begin by establishing your own dedicated training space—a quiet, private area where distractions are minimized and your focus is solely on perfecting your technique. Every training session should start with an extensive warm‑up tailored to your athletic mesomorph physique. Engage in dynamic stretching routines that target your core, hips, and lower back—these are the critical foundations that support every precise micro‑movement in the Bata Coxa Stroke. Visualize each stretch as igniting your internal engine, preparing every muscle and joint for the intricate work ahead. Take several deep, focused breaths to center your mind and set a clear, positive intention for your session.
Next, dive into specialized drills that target each individual component of the stroke. Begin with the tap keystroke drill. From your modified plank position—with your knees securely planted—practice small, controlled lateral taps. With your penis size between 5 and 7 inches, each lateral movement must be performed with pinpoint accuracy. Focus on raising your right hip just enough so that it gently taps the surface, then return smoothly to the center. Synchronize every movement with deliberate breathing—inhaling deeply before initiating the lateral shift and exhaling slowly as you complete the tap. To build precision, integrate kegeling exercises by contracting your pelvic floor during each lateral tap, which helps lock in the exact pressure. Aim for at least 30 deliberate repetitions on each side until the tap keystroke becomes naturally ingrained in your muscle memory.
Once you’ve mastered the lateral tap, integrate it with vertical movements. Practice a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head immediately followed by a series of lateral taps and a smooth, gradual backward shuttle. Ensure that every full cycle adheres strictly to the 80‑10‑10 principle, with about 80% of your force directed to the shallow zone while the mid‑depth and deep layers are gently engaged. Drill the full integrated sequence repeatedly on both sides until every transition flows seamlessly. Supplement these stroke-specific drills with targeted core‑strengthening exercises such as planks, abdominal crunches, and dynamic stability drills; a strong core is essential to maintaining both balance and precise control throughout the Bata Coxa Stroke. Finally, keep a detailed training journal where you record every session’s data—the number of repetitions, any slight adjustments you experiment with, and feedback from your partner. This journal is an indispensable tool in the Sexual Scientific Process, enabling you to track your progress, identify effective tweaks, and continuously refine your performance.
Your personalized practice routine is your roadmap to mastery, brother. With disciplined, consistent training, you’ll transform your natural mesomorph strength and moderate extension into a performance that is fluid, scientifically refined, and deeply satisfying.
──────────────────────────────────────── Module 8 – Advanced Integration, Troubleshooting, and Final Refinements
Finally, brother, we arrive at the advanced integration phase—a stage dedicated to merging every drilled component of the Bata Coxa Stroke into one seamless, continuous performance and troubleshooting any imperfections until your technique is flawless. This final module is the culmination of your dedicated training, where your athletic mesomorph build and your penis size between 5 and 7 inches converge into a rhythmic, cumulative expression of intimate mastery.
Begin your advanced session by settling into your training space with complete, undivided focus. Assume your starting position confidently—in your modified plank with your knees firmly planted, core engaged, and your mind solely focused on precision. Start by executing a slow, controlled forward push toward your partner’s head. As you move forward, ensure that the top shelf of your penis consistently caresses her clitoral region and that the head maintains deliberate, steady contact with her “south wall.” This forward drive must strictly adhere to the 80‑10‑10 principle—approximately 80% of your force should be focused on the shallow, nerve‑rich zone, while the remaining 20% is meticulously balanced to engage the mid‑depth and deep layers.
Immediately transition into the lateral phase by executing the tap keystroke with your right hip. Raise your hip in a small, deliberate lateral shift and perform three precise lateral taps. With every tap, focus intently on ensuring that the hilt of your penis applies targeted, controlled pressure against the left side of her vaginal opening, while the inner surface of your shaft produces a gentle, rhythmic rocking massage on her right internal wall. If any lateral tap seems inconsistent—whether due to uneven pressure or a misaligned lateral angle—pause and isolate that particular movement. Drill that segment repeatedly until both your internal feedback and your partner’s subtle cues confirm that the stimulation is perfectly balanced in line with the 80‑10‑10 principle.
Next, perform a controlled vertical pushout—a slow, deliberate upward extension that resets your position while allowing you to gather precise internal feedback. As you execute the pushout, pay close attention to the contraction of your core and the engagement of your pelvic floor, and listen for any subtle verbal or nonverbal cues from your partner. This troubleshooting phase is essential: if you find that the cumulative stimulation isn’t optimized, make small adjustments—perhaps a slight tweak in your lateral angle or a minor variation in the pace of your forward push—until your technique is refined. Utilize the iterative cycle of the Sexual Scientific Process: define your objective for that cycle, form a hypothesis about a minor improvement, track the outcome meticulously, and refine your technique accordingly.
Once you’re satisfied with your adjustments, repeat the entire integrated cycle continuously—forward push, lateral taps, vertical pushout, and backward shuttle—until every micro‑movement flows seamlessly as a unified, rhythmic performance. Then, mirror the cycle on the opposite side to ensure balanced stimulation throughout the entire vaginal canal. Achieving a state of natural flow—where every movement is executed automatically, with flawless precision and cumulative intensity—is the ultimate goal of your training. When you reach that state, your Bata Coxa Stroke will stand as a testament to your disciplined practice and technical mastery—a continuous, fluid performance that is both scientifically refined and deeply intimate.
Celebrate your progress, brother. Advanced integration, troubleshooting, and final refinements transform your dedicated training into an art form—a performance where every forward push, lateral tap, and backward shuttle is executed with cumulative precision and deeply balanced stimulation. Your athletic mesomorph strength and moderate extension have been honed into a seamless, rhythmic stroke that delivers optimal pleasure in every move. Happy training, brother—continue to track, refine, and evolve your technique, and let every flawless cycle of your Bata Coxa Stroke bring you closer to ultimate intimate mastery.
