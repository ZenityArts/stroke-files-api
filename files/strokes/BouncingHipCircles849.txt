Module 1 for The Bouncing Hip Circles teaches you how to build the base of the stroke—how to position your body so every orbit you make is smooth, balanced, and repeatable. Start in a forearm plank with your elbows directly below your shoulders and your fists softly closed. Your knees should be wide enough that your hips can move freely without strain, and your toes point slightly outward to keep your lower back relaxed. For an endomorphic build, your core strength and weight distribution give you natural grounding, but you must guard against collapsing into your joints. Keep a gentle lift in your abdomen, feel your pelvis as the pivot, and let your shoulders stay soft. Your penis length between five and seven inches gives you natural access to shallow and mid zones without forcing; the goal here is to master angle, not reach.
Breathe in slowly through your nose and let your spine lengthen. On the exhale, rock your hips forward just enough to feel the pelvis tilt and the shaft align toward the shallow 80% zone of her inner compass. Do not push or chase depth—this first movement is about sensing where neutral ends and engagement begins. As you inhale, bring the hips back to baseline, keeping the line of the spine steady. Think of this as calibrating your internal compass. Each exhale draws a Light pressure forward; each inhale resets you. Practice this until the movement feels like one slow breath that has a front and back instead of two separate parts.
As you warm up, begin exploring the lateral edges of your orbit. From baseline, roll your hips slightly right, tracing the right inner wall, then left, tracing the opposite. These Rocking motions show you the horizontal spread of your circle. Keep them inside the shallow zone; your five-to-seven-inch length will feel full without bottoming out. Light pressure stays best here—it lets you map sensation without fatigue. Inhale to prepare, exhale through the roll. If you notice your shoulders tightening, reset to baseline and widen your knee stance a few inches to offload joint pressure.
Once your lateral range feels clear, shift into Angling practice. From baseline, tuck your pelvis forward at a slight diagonal—imagine pointing the tip toward her left collarbone—then draw it back to center. Repeat toward her right collarbone. These small diagonals create the vertical lift component that defines the Bouncing Hip Circles later. Work these diagonals under Medium pressure for short breaths, never more than two or three before resetting. You’ll feel your abdominals engage as stabilizers; that tension is what protects your lower spine. Endomorphic builds should focus on maintaining that engagement rather than forcing amplitude.
Every few minutes, return to complete stillness. Forearms flat, hips hovering, breath steady. This is your neutral baseline. It’s where you feel the load path—how your weight moves through elbows, core, and knees. The better you sense this line, the easier it will be to control rhythm later. Your reflection focus is noticing stability: when the hips move, nothing else should. Shoulders, neck, and arms remain quiet while the pelvis writes the motion. A simple journal tag after each session can be “Neutral hold steady @12 breaths.”
By the end of this orientation work, your body should know where balance lives and how Light and Medium pressure differ in feel, not thought. You will have built the physical vocabulary that all keystrokes use later. When posture, breath, and control align, circular rhythm becomes effortless instead of forced.

============================================================================================
Module 2 for The Bouncing Hip Circles teaches you the individual keystrokes that make up the stroke’s rhythm. These are the building blocks you’ll later chain into continuous orbit. Each keystroke has a purpose: to teach your hips how to move independently from your upper body, to teach your core how to stabilize rotation, and to train your breath to match pressure. Because your body type is endomorphic, your leverage comes from weight and groundedness, not speed. You will use that natural stability to carve smooth, deliberate orbits that stay consistent even under fatigue. With a penis length between five and seven inches, you can safely explore both the shallow and mid zones of depth, but never push beyond the comfortable glide of Medium pressure.
The first keystroke is the Forward Rock. Start in your forearm plank baseline with your pelvis neutral and spine straight. Inhale to prepare; exhale as you press your hips forward just enough to feel contact along the shallow 80%. Your movement should come from the lower abdomen, not the shoulders. This Rocking motion trains the horizontal axis of the circle. The goal is consistency—same tempo, same Light pressure—until your body can repeat it without sway or collapse. Reset to neutral every five to six breaths. The internal effect is teaching your nervous system where your maximum forward extension ends. You’ll feel the front of your hips warm as they control the stop. Record your first successful set with a shorthand note like “Fwd rock stable@6”.
The second keystroke is the Lateral Sweep. From baseline, exhale and slide your hips right, feeling the right inner wall, then inhale back to center. Repeat to the left. This motion defines your compass control—the ability to stay in contact while circling without losing alignment. It’s a Rocking pattern along the horizontal plane. Keep the sweep small at first, no more than a palm-width from center. For an endomorphic build, control trumps reach; let your glutes and thighs do the steering, not your back. Use Light pressure for mapping, Medium only once the line feels smooth. You’ll sense a pull on one side more than the other; note which feels tighter—it will guide future tracking.
The third keystroke is the Diagonal Tilt. This begins to shift you into the Angling dimension of the stroke. From neutral, imagine pointing your tip toward her left collarbone; that’s the upper-left diagonal. On the exhale, tilt your pelvis slightly in that direction, then return on the inhale. Alternate sides. This movement engages the obliques and lower abs, building rotational endurance. Your size range allows just enough penetration depth to feel the diagonal path without strain, but avoid the temptation to push—keep within mid 10% only. This keystroke lays the foundation for the bouncing sensation later, when you’ll combine tilt and rock into an orbit.
The final keystroke is the Back Draw. From full forward Rock, inhale and draw your hips back to baseline under control. This is more than a return; it trains your posterior chain to decelerate the circle smoothly. Endomorphs benefit from emphasizing the draw because it balances forward power with controlled retreat, protecting joints and spine. Use Light pressure, full breath cycles, and stop at neutral before repeating. You’ll feel your hamstrings tighten slightly at the end of each draw—that tension is correct; it anchors your range.
Each keystroke builds awareness of one direction of motion: forward, lateral, diagonal, and back. Together they create the map your hips will later orbit through in rhythm. End each practice with two minutes of still plank breathing, feeling the residual heat in your core as proof of activation. Write one simple line in your journal such as “All four keys mapped, L diag smoother@10.” That note locks in both the physical and cognitive recall. These keystrokes are your alphabet; the stroke itself will soon become your language.

============================================================================================
Module 3 for The Bouncing Hip Circles shows you how to build the full rhythm from the keystrokes you’ve already trained. You are now combining the Forward Rock, Lateral Sweep, Diagonal Tilt, and Back Draw into one continuous motion that feels like orbiting from the core. This is where movement begins to feel circular rather than linear. Start from your neutral forearm-plank baseline, shoulders stacked, spine long, pelvis hovering level with your elbows. Take a deep inhale and let your breath drop low into your abdomen. On the exhale, begin your Forward Rock toward the shallow 80%, slide right into the Lateral Sweep, pivot through the Diagonal Tilt, and finish with the Back Draw into neutral. The motion should form a looping pattern, not a square. Each link must feel rounded at the transitions, never jerky or segmented. Think of the pelvis tracing a small circle no larger than a saucer. The internal goal is to teach the hips to flow without loss of pressure or compass awareness.
For your build, rhythm depends on grounding. Keep your knees slightly wide to distribute your weight. Your heavier frame will stabilize your plank and let you move slower without wobbling. Let your breath time the orbit—inhale as you draw back, exhale through the forward and side phases. This breath rhythm keeps your diaphragm engaged, protecting your spine and helping stamina. Your 5–7 inch depth gives you enough reach to feel mid-wall friction at the peak of each diagonal without over-penetrating; stay within Medium pressure. If your chest starts dropping or your shoulders slide forward, reset completely to neutral and rebuild the circle. This is a baseline safeguard that protects the wrist, shoulder, and lumbar line.
As you loop the orbit, imagine your hips stirring water in a bowl rather than thrusting. This grounded metaphor helps maintain flow. Each pass around the circle alternates Rocking and Angling—forward and lateral are Rocking motions, while the diagonals add Angling torque. Together they train control of both planes. Her cues will tell you when the circle finds its natural groove: a quiet inhale, a stilling of her hips, or a slow pelvic curl toward you. These signs confirm the rhythm is landing. When that happens, stay with that exact pressure and tempo for five full breaths before resetting. Journal it in one short note like “Full orbit smooth@5 breaths, center-left favored.”
If you notice uneven friction or loss of clarity on one side, return to that single keystroke and remap it before chaining again. This is your SSP loop—observe, tweak, retest. Endomorphic frames sometimes fatigue in the lower back during longer sets; counter this by shortening the circle to half-size for recovery while keeping tempo steady. This maintains rhythm without overloading your joints. Over time, these orbits will feel autonomous, like the hips know where to go without command. That is the goal: unconscious flow driven by breath, not effort.

============================================================================================
Module 4 for The Bouncing Hip Circles begins the Tracking Phase—the science of precision. You now use SSP logic to test, observe, and refine how your circular motion interacts with the shallow 80% zone of her compass. This phase is about clarity, not power. Begin in your forearm plank baseline, spine long, elbows firm, hips hovering. Take two slow breaths to stabilize. On your exhale, ease into the full circular orbit you built in Module 3, but shrink the diameter by half. Keep Light pressure, never breaking that shallow plane. The circle should feel like a fingertip tracing glass. Your job is to form hypotheses about what creates the cleanest, most friction-rich contact: smaller or wider arcs, slower or faster pace, slightly higher or lower pelvic height. Track one variable per mini-set—no guessing, no mixing.
For endomorphic builds, your natural stability can make feedback subtle; you’ll need to exaggerate focus. Feel where the warmth gathers first—right wall, top diagonal, or front crest—and mark it mentally. That’s your current friction bias. Your 5–7 inch depth gives you safe room to glide over the sensitive walls without pressing into the mid zone, so stay in Light-to-Medium pressure bands. If your hips start sinking or your breath becomes shallow, return to neutral for one full inhale reset before continuing. This baseline reset is your internal calibration; skipping it blurs data and increases fatigue.
Cycle through short tracking sets: five to seven rotations on one wall, pause, observe her subtle cues. If her breath deepens or her hips lift slightly into you, that confirms your angle is on track. If her body quiets or tension rises, lighten pressure and test again. These are observable cues—not imagination. Your goal is to refine the circle so it matches her body’s natural pull. The SSP loop here is Define → Hypothesize → Track → Refine. Define what you’re testing (“Does smaller right orbit hold pressure longer?”), run a five-rotation test, then refine based on what you felt. Keep each test isolated and short.
Endomorph builds need to protect lumbar and wrist joints during long tracking. Keep your elbows directly under shoulders, tighten the belly during each orbit, and never let your hips sag past elbow line. You may feel heat in the core and thighs—that’s your stabilizers working correctly. Use Light pressure for half of each set, then Medium for the final two cycles to sense transition friction. If you lose wall contact or rhythm breaks, reset completely, breathe, and start from the most successful angle you found.
Close each session with a full neutral hold—hips steady, forearms grounded—for five breaths. Feel the afterglow of warmth across your lower abdomen and thighs; that’s your nervous system locking in feedback. Write one short note such as “Small right orbit, Light pressure@7 reps = strongest cue.” Tracking mastery means nothing is random. Each rotation teaches you exactly how to listen with motion.

============================================================================================
Module 5 for The Bouncing Hip Circles brings you into the Flow Phase—the point where rhythm, breath, and contact merge into one seamless loop. Flow is the first stage of real mastery. You are no longer testing angles; you are sustaining the best one you discovered during Tracking. Start in your forearm-plank baseline, shoulders steady, chest open, and pelvis hovering with the spine in one long line. Inhale to prepare. On the exhale, enter your circle at the shallow 80% where friction felt clearest. Let the orbit build gradually, small and confident. The circle should feel like a pendulum with no edges, moving through both Rocking and Angling in balance. Each rotation becomes one long breath: exhale through the forward and side arcs, inhale as you draw back.
For an endomorphic build, the Flow rhythm thrives on steadiness over speed. Your weight naturally anchors the motion, giving each orbit a heavy, hypnotic gravity. Use this advantage. Keep Medium pressure as your ceiling—enough for presence, never force. Your 5–7 inch depth gives perfect clearance to work the shallow and occasionally the upper-mid 10% zones without losing wall sensitivity. If you feel your hips begin to bounce too high, shorten the vertical range and let the circle widen horizontally instead. This keeps strain off the lower back while preserving connection. Flow should feel like your hips are suspended in warm water, every movement smooth and reversible.
Her cues will be unmistakable when Flow stabilizes: a slower breathing rhythm, her pelvis curling upward, a soft moan that comes unforced, or the moment her body stops chasing and simply receives. These cues confirm the orbit has synchronized with her nervous system. When you sense that, hold your tempo steady for at least six full breaths. Let each exhale be an offering of stability, not drive. The goal is to maintain a rhythm she can dissolve into. If you sense her breath stutter or tension rise, lighten the next two cycles and shorten the circle by half until her body softens again.
Internally, you’ll feel a mild heat behind your navel and a pulsing weight at the base of your pelvis. That’s Flow in your own body—your nervous system relaxing into rhythm. Maintain plank discipline: wrists relaxed, elbows stacked, core tight enough to prevent sag. For endomorphic hips, fatigue shows first as shoulder slump; correct it immediately by pressing forearms down and re-lengthening the spine. Never sacrifice posture for speed. Flow is endurance, not explosion.
As you close practice, fade the orbit down to stillness across two or three breaths. Return to neutral and rest with your pelvis heavy, noticing the warmth in your abdomen and the steadiness of your breath. That calm pulse is your sign of Flow integration. Write one clean journal note like “Steady orbit@6 breaths, Medium pressure, her hips curved in.” This line captures your current best rhythm—your first trace of mastery on the wall map.
Ready to proceed to Module 6 for The Bouncing Hip Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


============================================================================================
Module 6 for The Bouncing Hip Circles teaches controlled expansion into the deeper 10%—the Flow Deep Option. This is where restraint defines strength. You are not chasing depth; you are testing if the deeper orbit can hold the same smooth pressure as the shallow one without breaking rhythm. Begin in your forearm-plank baseline. Take two slow breaths to center the spine. Inhale, then on your exhale, allow the hips to drop slightly lower as the circle widens forward. The head of the penis travels a touch deeper along the same compass path, shifting from the shallow 80% into the mid and then deep 10% only for a moment. Think of it as tracing the lower rim of the same circle, not pushing farther in. The motion remains Rocking and Angling at once, a balanced orbit that presses gently into the back wall while still sweeping across her right and left arcs.
For endomorphic frames, this requires fine control. Use your body weight as ballast—let gravity provide the pressure instead of muscle thrust. Keep the circle smaller and slower than before, emphasizing steadiness over size. The heavier build gives you leverage, but it also magnifies pressure quickly, so stay in the Medium band and touch Hard only for a single exhale when testing depth response. Your 5–7 inch range sits perfectly for this calibration; it allows deep contact without triggering cervix compression. If you sense internal resistance—her hips pulling away, breath holding, or sudden stillness—retreat immediately to shallow orbit and reestablish flow. Deep work succeeds only when her body opens naturally.
As the circle finds its deep rhythm, the sensation will shift from surface friction to internal warmth, a kind of suction at the lower walls. Her cues will slow down—her breath may deepen into her belly, or her thighs might draw in slightly to guide you. These are signs that the deeper orbit is welcome. Stay within that zone for no more than five rotations at a time, then return to shallow for two to recover. This oscillation trains sensitivity while keeping the nervous system calm. Think of it like dipping the orbit under water and resurfacing each breath.
Biomechanically, maintain your neutral line from shoulder to knee; do not let the chest collapse forward or the lower back sway. For an endomorph, joint load control is key: your hips must remain buoyant even during deeper arcs. The spine should feel suspended, not pressed. Use the exhale as a release valve; it keeps pressure steady and prevents overreach. If you feel any strain, abort depth and reset to baseline immediately. Rest hygiene protects stamina and keeps your coordination precise.
End the session by fully withdrawing to the shallow 80%, holding Light pressure and circling for two calm breaths before stilling completely. Feel the echo of deep contact settle into warmth across your abdomen. Write a simple note like “Deep test, 5 reps@Medium, hips pulled in.” This confirms successful depth gating. You are now fluent in both surface and depth flow—a dual mastery that sets up the precision work ahead.
Ready to proceed to Module 7 for The Bouncing Hip Circles with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


============================================================================================
Module 7 for The Bouncing Hip Circles introduces the Pinning Phase—where you learn to control post-orgasmic energy through micro-adjustments instead of momentum. This is where mastery becomes finesse. Begin in the same forearm-plank baseline you used for Flow, but lower your body slightly so your pelvis rests heavier into her hips. Inhale slowly, and as you exhale, restart the orbit in its smallest form—just enough to feel the right and left walls. This time the circles are no larger than a thumb’s width. The purpose is to test responsiveness after a peak, not to rebuild it. Use Light pressure only, shifting toward Medium when you feel her body reawaken under you. The rhythm now belongs to the SSP loop of Observe → Tweak → Test. You watch how her breath, pulse, and muscle tone change with every micro-angle and adapt instantly.
Your endomorphic leverage is your ally in Pinning because your mass creates a natural steadiness. Let gravity hold you in place while your hips draw slow, controlled circles, almost invisible. This anchors her body after release and invites her into new waves without shocking her system. Keep your depth limited to the shallow 80%, where sensitivity is highest. With a 5–7 inch range, the shallow position gives full wall contact without overreaching. The goal is not to drive but to cradle. When her breath catches, or when her hips tilt upward again, that’s the moment to subtly change the circle—perhaps a half-inch shift to the right, or a slower roll along the south wall. These tiny tests reveal where residual pleasure still lives.
Internally, Pinning feels like holding a tremor still. You may sense her heartbeat pulsing through the base of your shaft, or a faint suction as her muscles contract again. Keep breathing through this, steady and calm. Each exhale guides her nervous system to match yours. The moment she exhales deeply or releases a low sound, stay on that precise orbit for three more breaths—it means you’ve found the next ignition point. Avoid chasing sensation. Pinning is about patience, not performance.
If fatigue builds in your shoulders or wrists, pause in neutral baseline for one full breath, keeping insertion light. Re-engage only when you feel your core active again. For endomorphic builds, joint safety matters—micro-movements should come from pelvic rotation, not upper-body push. Picture the motion like a slow gyroscope: steady center, smooth edges. When she stills completely and her breath evens out, that’s your cue to withdraw slowly and hold stillness over her hips. Let both bodies calm before you move again.
End with a five-breath rest in neutral, hips hovering, breathing through the residual heat in your abdomen. Feel how quiet and heavy your body becomes—this is the calm strength of a controlled finisher. Record a simple note like “Pin@Light, small orbit right side, breath sync at 3rd exhale.” These notes capture precision that will evolve into instinct later. You have now reached the level where control equals connection, and every small motion carries intent.

============================================================================================
Module 8 for The Bouncing Hip Circles is your integration and training plan. This phase takes all the posture, keystrokes, rhythm control, and sensory tracking you’ve built and translates them into a four-week training rhythm that builds endurance, wall clarity, and neural fluency. The focus now is consistency—moving from conscious execution to instinctive mastery. Every session begins the same way: one full minute in neutral forearm-plank, breathing deeply, aligning wrists under shoulders, and letting the hips hang in suspension. This posture centers the spine and quiets excess tension before movement starts. The first breaths are slow, like lowering your system’s noise floor. You are teaching your nervous system that every stroke begins from stillness.
For the first week, keep sessions short—three rounds of shallow Flow practice lasting five minutes each, with two-minute rests in between. During these rounds, stay entirely in the shallow 80%, circling on either the right or left wall depending on what your tracking notes showed as most responsive. Endomorphic builds fatigue slower in the hips but faster in the shoulders, so use the rest window to reset posture rather than collapse completely. Your Medium pressure ceiling remains your safety line; do not exceed it, even if stamina feels high. The 5–7 inch range keeps you within perfect control of depth, so focus on maintaining precise orbit shape instead of chasing penetration force.
Weeks two and three move into endurance sets—extend each Flow round to eight minutes, alternating between walls every two minutes. Begin to include the deep Flow option you trained in Module 6, but only for five rotations at a time before returning to shallow orbit. This oscillation conditions depth sensitivity and refines your internal feedback. When fatigue appears, breathe down into your abdomen instead of tensing your shoulders; this restores stability through the core rather than the arms. Each session should end with two minutes of Pinning-style micro-circles, as if you were finishing an actual encounter. This teaches your body to transition smoothly between phases without thought.
The fourth week integrates everything into one continuous twenty-minute cycle: one minute neutral baseline, four minutes shallow Flow, two minutes deep Flow test, three minutes back to shallow, one minute of Pinning, and one final neutral close. Repeat this twice with five-minute rest between sets. Journal after each session in one clean line—“Right wall@Medium, 12-min Flow, steady breath, hips opened at minute 8.” This record becomes your mirror. Patterns will appear. Some days the orbit will feel effortless; other days stiff. Both are useful data under the SSP method. The goal is never perfection—it’s continuous refinement through observation and return.
For safety and longevity, always respect joint recovery. Endomorphic frames benefit from shoulder mobility work and hip stretches post-practice. Never overtrain consecutive days without at least one rest period. The stroke’s strength lies in rhythm and feel, not brute force. Over time, you’ll notice that the circle becomes automatic; your body finds the wall before thought. When that happens, your nervous system has accepted the stroke as part of its language. That’s the true sign of mastery—when you no longer perform it, you live it.
