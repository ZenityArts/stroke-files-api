Module 1 for The Harrare is about setting your orientation, body posture, and depth control so that every keystroke later has a safe and powerful base. You begin in a clean forearm-plank, with your elbows directly under your shoulders and your spine in one straight line from the crown of your head to the base of your hips. Your knees stay wide on the canvas so you are stable but not locked. For an ectomorph frame, the challenge is managing joint load—your shoulders and wrists are more vulnerable to fatigue, so you need to spread weight evenly through forearms and engage your core to protect your back. This neutral baseline is the anchor position you must return to after every movement cycle so your angles stay repeatable and your depth control doesn’t drift.
From this baseline, you learn how to settle depth before adding angle. With a penis length of five to seven inches, the canal presents clear shallow and mid options but little margin for deep thrusting. The 80–10–10 rule sets your rhythm: eighty percent of reps in the shallow front, ten percent in mid, and no more than ten percent in deep zones. This means you must train yourself to feel the shallow glide as the main terrain, letting the mid zone serve as accent and the deep zone as a rare emphasis. To achieve this, you set pressure ceilings. Light pressure pairs with shallow compass glides where the head traces walls without pressing in; medium pressure marks mid-zone entries where contact is firmer and usually linked to her pelvic curl; hard pressure is rarely needed here, but if you reach the deep ten percent, you use it with care only when her hips pull in or her breath stills. Inhale to prepare at neutral, exhale through the action into her body, and inhale again as you reset. The breath anchors the whole cycle.
Think of your neutral baseline as the mat in a boxing ring: every move you make is thrown and then returned to center. The reflection point after each keystroke is where you notice what her body gave back—was it a deeper exhale, did her hips press forward, did she hold still in a way that meant she wanted you to stay? As an ectomorph, you will often feel fatigue earlier in the shoulders and lower back, so your reflection includes checking whether you are sagging your hips or letting elbows slide too far forward. A clean baseline protects your stamina, lets you sustain longer sets, and gives her consistent wall clarity because you are not wobbling into zones by accident.
The internal effect of this first module is twofold. Physically, you learn to hold a posture that stabilizes your depth and angle; mentally, you learn to discipline yourself to always return to a neutral reset rather than rushing into the next stroke. With a five to seven inch size, this habit magnifies your clarity because she feels precise wall contact rather than scattered pressure. Your journal entry for this session might read in one line: “South-east diagonal, shallow, light pressure, exhale steady at rep six.” That single line captures compass, depth, pressure, and breath timing without clutter.

===============================================================================


Module 2 for The Harrare is about breaking down the keystrokes that form the full stroke so you can train them one at a time with clarity. Each movement starts from a stable forearm-plank baseline, and each keystroke works like a distinct lever you can isolate before chaining them into rhythm. For an ectomorph body type with a penis length of five to seven inches, the goal is to keep leverage clean, pressure controlled, and depth gated so the contact lands with precision on the intended wall.
The first keystroke is the left hip drop. From neutral plank, you exhale as your left hip lowers toward the canvas, tilting your shaft so the head angles across and presses into her right wall. This is primarily an angling action rather than a rocking one. Depth stays shallow under the 80% rule, with light to medium pressure depending on how she meets you. With five to seven inches, this keeps you from overshooting deeper zones and protects your stamina. Her cue is often a soft sigh or a pelvic curl as that right wall pressure sharpens, and your reflection is to note whether you can sustain light pressure without collapsing your plank.
The next keystroke is the right hip follow-down. From the left hip drop, you let your right hip lower so both hips hover near the canvas. This creates a sweep across her canal as your shaft angles from the right wall toward the north wall. Here the motion combines angling and a slight rocking quality. You are grazing mid-zone entry as you cross toward the north wall, but with a five to seven inch size you stay closer to shallow and mid rather than deep. Medium pressure works best, timed with an exhale, and the rhythm phase here leans toward flow. Her cue might be her hips pressing in or her breath pausing at the crest of contact, and you can reflect on whether your sweep feels like a glide rather than a shove.
The third keystroke is the right hip lift back to its starting position while the left hip remains low. This makes your shaft sweep from the north wall back toward the right wall, a lateral angling action. The depth zone is shallow again, light to medium pressure, and this keystroke is best for tracking because it teaches you what part of the right wall she responds to. Her cues may include a deeper breath or slight stilling of the body if the angle feels right. For an ectomorph, the reflection is about whether your shoulder and core alignment holds, since fatigue can make your hip lift uneven.
The final keystroke in the sequence is lifting both hips back to neutral plank, which resets your shaft to the diagonal starting line between the right wall and south wall. This is a pure baseline reset rather than a pressure stroke, but she still feels the transition as the head traces back along her lower canal. The depth is shallow, the pressure is light, and the rhythm phase is flow to pinning depending on whether she presses back into you. The reflection here is simple: did you return to a clean neutral or did fatigue pull your hips forward?
A mirror sequence repeats these keystrokes on the opposite side, starting with the right hip drop to stimulate her left wall. The same angling logic applies, just mirrored across compass directions. For both sides, the journaling tag might read: “Right wall, shallow, medium pressure, exhale steady at rep eight.” This one sentence captures the compass, depth, pressure, and breath cycle so you can refine later.

===============================================================================


Module 3 for The Harrare focuses on chaining the keystrokes into a full rhythm so the stroke becomes fluid and sustainable. You already know each keystroke as an isolated lever, now the goal is to sequence them with breath, pacing, and clean resets so the logic of the stroke forms in your body. Always begin from the neutral forearm plank, wrists stacked under shoulders, spine long, hips steady above the canvas. From this baseline, the stroke grows through one hip lowering, the opposite hip following, the sweep across her canal, and then the lift back to neutral.
Start with the left-side chain. You exhale as the left hip drops, angling the head into her right wall. Without pausing, inhale lightly, then exhale again as the right hip follows down, sweeping across into her north wall. You hold steady for a beat, noticing if she presses in, then inhale as you prepare to lift the right hip while the left hip stays low. This makes your shaft sweep back from the north wall to the right wall. Finally, both hips lift smoothly together into the neutral baseline, the shaft tracing diagonally from the right toward the south wall. That reset completes one full arc. Reflection here is about whether your breath is consistent with the hip sequence or whether you’re rushing through without syncing air to motion.
The mirrored chain begins with the right hip drop to the left wall, the left hip following into the north wall sweep, then the left hip lift pulling back across, and finally the reset to neutral. Each side carries the same sequence logic, just mirrored across compass. With a five to seven inch length, you stay safely within shallow to mid depth, making each sweep feel precise rather than blunt. For an ectomorph frame, the key is pacing—avoid long holds that burn your core too quickly. Keep the cycle time short and steady, like drawing slow diagonal X’s across her canal, never jerking or stalling.
Neuroplastic progression comes by running these cycles slowly at first, emphasizing the reset each time so your nervous system learns the clean baseline. Think of it like practicing scales on a piano before attempting a song—you are teaching your body the pattern until it feels automatic. Once you can cycle four full arcs per side without losing form or breath, you let rhythm smooth them together, sliding seamlessly from left chain to right chain. Reflection is whether the transitions feel like a glide through water or like separate steps stitched together. She will tell you with her cues: hips curling in if you are on pace, stillness or withdrawal if you break flow.

===============================================================================


Module 4 for The Harrare is where you step into the Tracking phase and run the SSP loop inside the shallow 80%. The goal now is no longer just to string keystrokes together, but to test how each compass wall receives them. You are not pushing for flow or climax yet—you are observing, logging, and refining. Begin in the neutral forearm plank, weight spread evenly, wrists stacked, shoulders set, hips steady. From here, choose one side of the stroke and run a mini-set of four cycles, keeping the action in the shallow zone only. Each sweep across the canal should be paired with a steady exhale, each reset with a quiet inhale. The ectomorph build means your muscles will fatigue quickly if you overload pressure, so cap yourself at Medium pressure during these runs and return to baseline often to protect stamina.
In practice, you lower the hip to engage the wall, sweep across, reset, and hold for a brief beat, watching for her cues. A soft exhale from her, a pelvic curl, or the way her hips press up tell you the angle is landing. If instead she goes still or shifts away, you know the wall contact is too blunt, too shallow, or the tempo broke rhythm. Your task is to form a hypothesis—such as “north sweep with left hip first gives her a deeper breath”—and then test it with three more cycles. Afterward, you log a quick reflection in plain words, something as simple as, “North sweep, shallow, Medium pressure, pelvic curl at rep two.” The SSP cycle means you are not just moving, you are tracking her feedback like data, refining the stroke angle and tempo against what her body gives back.
When switching walls, reset fully in plank before beginning again. This neutral hold not only saves your joints but also clears your nervous system for the next test. Think of it as a tuning fork returning to silence before sounding again. The 80–10–10 principle means you keep almost all of this testing in shallow play, dipping into mid only when her cues show she is craving more pressure or depth. With a five to seven inch shaft, mid zone is accessible without overreaching, but only if her hips curl in or her breath deepens—never force it. By journaling each wall separately and staying strict with baseline resets, you teach your body to feel the difference between east, west, and north rather than letting the motion blur together.
Reflection at this stage is about clarity, not mastery. You are finding which keystroke sequence produces consistent partner cues, and which need adjusting. Over time, your nervous system learns to link wall angle, pressure, and her response into a map you can trust later during Flow. For now, every cue is information, every reset is a chance to refine, and every cycle logged becomes part of the stroke’s growing intelligence inside your body.

===============================================================================


Module 5 for The Harrare is where you begin sustaining flow rather than just testing walls in isolation. Your aim now is to hold a consistent rhythm in the shallow 80% while letting the stroke build a natural groove. Start again from a strong neutral plank, hips square, wrists and shoulders balanced. From here, chain two to three keystrokes together without breaking back to baseline on every pass. Each cycle should ride a steady inhale–exhale loop: inhale to prepare as you reset, exhale to press and sweep across her wall. This breath anchoring keeps your ectomorph frame from over-tensing, which preserves stamina over longer sets.
Focus on keeping pressure at Light to Medium in shallow range, allowing her body to guide you before adding intensity. With a shaft length in the five to seven inch range, shallow and mid walls are both accessible, but you must avoid slipping into hard depth by accident. Think of it like circling the rim of a glass with your finger—you are drawing out resonance through consistency, not banging for volume. When her hips curl or her breath deepens, you can slide briefly into mid zone on a diagonal sweep, but always return to shallow quickly so the canal does not tighten against you. Flow here is about expansion and return, not escalation.
Your partner’s body will show you when the rhythm is correct. If she presses her hips upward, sighs into the tempo, or holds still against you, she is inside the stroke. If she fidgets or exhales sharply, you broke rhythm or angle. Correct by softening pressure, widening your hip arc, or slowing your exhale to reset her nervous system. The ectomorph build means your joints must not carry jerky loads—so keep Rocking motions smooth, with the Angling shifts subtle and finger-width at most. By staying smooth and light, you preserve joint safety and deliver her more predictable contact on each wall.
Flow is successful when you no longer have to think about every keystroke and can ride the sequence as one coherent rhythm. Journal short reflections immediately after a set, something as plain as, “West sweep, shallow, Light pressure, hips pressed in on rep five.” Over time, these entries become a map of which flow sequences trigger her deeper responses.

===============================================================================


Module 6 for The Harrare is where you carefully test whether mid and deep zones can be added without breaking the flow or causing discomfort. Because you are working with an ectomorph frame and a shaft length in the five to seven inch range, your leverage allows access to mid depth safely, but you must be precise with gating and pressure ceilings. Always begin in a neutral forearm-plank with your hips square and weight balanced. From that baseline, inhale to prepare, then on the exhale let one hip sink an inch lower to angle the head toward mid zone. Think of it as dipping just past the rim of the glass you circled before, adding richness to the vibration without flooding it.
Mid depth should only take up about ten percent of your cycles. Stay Light to Medium with pressure—never Hard—because deeper thrusts amplify force against her cervix. Use breath as your safety governor: exhale as you enter, inhale as you reset to shallow. If she curls her pelvis under, holds still with intention, or releases a long sigh, that’s her body inviting depth. If she tenses, arches away, or exhales sharply, you’ve gone too far—back off and return to shallow. Your ectomorph joints are protected when you treat the deeper pass as a glide rather than a drop. Avoid letting your hips collapse, and keep your spine long so shoulders don’t bear excess strain.
Occasionally, when lubrication is high and her hips draw you in, you may graze the deep 10%. For this body type and size, that means a cervix tap, not a sustained push. The key is using it as a contrast—like the bass note under a melody—rather than a constant line. Journal it as a momentary event: “North wall, mid, Medium pressure, pelvic curl at rep six.” These records will show you exactly which angles and pressures she welcomes deeper.
Over time, integrating shallow 80%, mid 10%, and rare deep 10% creates a richer stroke vocabulary. The woman experiences both safety and surprise, while you expand your control and legacy as a one-of-one specialist. Flowing depth wisely protects your frame and her body at the same time, and the discipline of depth gating will separate your stroke from the forgettable men she has known before.

===============================================================================


Module 7 for The Harrare is where you learn to use pinning as a precise post-orgasm strategy. Instead of chasing speed or force, you slow the rhythm into short, controlled bursts that lock her body into deeper waves. Begin in your neutral forearm-plank baseline, inhale to prepare, then on the exhale guide your hip tilt so the head pins lightly into the chosen wall—right, left, or north—staying in the shallow 80% but with steadier pressure. Think of it as holding a note on a string instrument: the tone is sustained, not struck.
During pinning, pressure shifts into Medium, rarely Hard, because what she feels is the focused weight of angle and stillness rather than depth. Rocking is reduced while angling becomes the main driver, using tiny shifts in hip line to keep contact alive. When you see her hips pressing back, her breath growing slow, or her body stilled as if waiting, those are cues that the pin has locked in. If instead she arches away or her breath turns sharp, release immediately back to shallow rocking and reset.
Apply the SSP loop here with Observe, Tweak, and Test. Observe her cues with each micro-hold, tweak the compass angle or pressure slightly, then test for response. A soft exhale or pelvic curl confirms success; no change means the adjustment isn’t hitting. Journal it in simple shorthand like “Right wall, shallow, Medium pin, pelvic curl at rep three.” These notes will guide you to recreate the exact sequence that sparks multiples.
With an ectomorph frame and five to seven inch shaft, your safety adaptation is clear: keep joint load light by never collapsing your hips, and avoid over-pressing into mid or deep zones since your leverage is already precise in shallow. Short bursts of pinning preserve stamina and prevent shoulder fatigue, and your range is ideal for making her walls feel continuously engaged. In practice, rotate between pinning sets and full resets in plank, always using the exhale to sink into stillness and the inhale to float back to neutral.

===============================================================================
Module 8 for The Harrare is your integration plan, where everything practiced across the earlier modules comes together in a structured rhythm cycle. Think of this as a four-week training arc where you slowly move from posture mastery toward repeatable flow. Begin every session by re-establishing your neutral forearm-plank baseline, wrists stacked, shoulders lifted, hips aligned, and breath anchored. For ectomorphs, posture is your safety net: you need to keep your long frame lifted so that fatigue does not collapse your hips or strain your shoulders. Enter each set by inhaling to steady the core and exhaling through the first keystroke, always returning to baseline before chaining.
In the first week, spend most of your time with isolated keystrokes at shallow depth, focusing on clarity of contact along the right, left, and north walls. Shallow 80% is where your size and leverage are most effective, so here is where the bulk of your practice should live. By the second week, start chaining two keystrokes together with three to four reps before resetting, watching for cues like a deeper breath or her hips pulling you in. Journal these sequences in one-line shorthand, such as “Left wall sweep, shallow, Medium pressure, hips pressed in at rep five.” These records will become the map of your adjustments.
Week three is where you enter sustained Flow. Instead of only chaining two keystrokes, extend to full sequences, always guided by breath anchors. Inhale to lift back to neutral, exhale to drive through the wall contact, repeat with steady tempo. Keep pressure Medium for stamina and clarity, using Light when her body goes still and you want to tease her back into motion. Stamina is your biggest guardrail as an ectomorph: rotate between thirty to forty second flow sets and full plank resets, letting the shoulders shake out before re-entering.
By week four, add Pinning bursts at the end of each flow set. After a short sequence, drop into one or two controlled pin holds, angling into a chosen wall with a steady exhale, watching for pelvic curl or hips pressing back as confirmation. This is how you layer multiples without breaking rhythm. Limit each pinning burst to no more than three breaths before resetting, which protects your joints and preserves leverage.
Across all weeks, respect depth gating. With five to seven inches, your edge of effectiveness remains in the shallow and mid zones, and pushing toward the deep 10% risks losing wall contact. Instead, use angles and diagonals to amplify stimulation without needing depth. The compass is your friend here—move across walls rather than chasing forward distance. End every session by journaling one clear observation, such as “North wall sweep, shallow, Medium, pelvic curl at rep four.” These notes close the feedback loop and prepare you for the next practice.
