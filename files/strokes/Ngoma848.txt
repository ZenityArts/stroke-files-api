Module 1 for The Ngoma focuses on setting up orientation and body posture so that every keystroke in later modules has a safe and stable base. In missionary, with your weight supported in forearm plank, you are not just lying on top of her—you are building a stable bridge that keeps your spine straight, shoulders stacked, wrists free from strain, and hips square. For an endomorph body type, this means paying close attention to joint load, since extra mass through the shoulders and hips can cause fatigue or compression. Dropping the forearms wide on the canvas spreads your weight so your chest floats rather than presses, and pulling the shoulder blades gently together keeps the line of your upper body strong and prevents collapse into your neck. From this foundation, the pelvis has the clearance to Rock and Angle without dumping weight forward, which is critical when the penis is shorter than average because wall contact must be precise and repeatable.
When you first enter her body, think of the neutral plank as your home base. The shaft rests along the downward diagonal into the shallow 80% zone, with pressure in Light to Medium range, and the baseline angle is your compass anchor. Inhale to settle, exhale to connect. Every keystroke you will learn later starts from here, and every return to baseline resets clarity for the next stroke. If you lose neutral, you lose the accuracy that makes the stroke work. For the endomorph, holding the core gently engaged keeps belly weight from sagging onto her, which not only preserves her breathing space but also gives your hips more freedom to tilt and grind without strain. For below-average length, staying in shallow depth with consistent angle is what gives her clear wall contact instead of losing sensation in floating thrusts.
The reflection part of this orientation is noticing what she does in response to your neutral base. A deep inhale as you rest inside her means her body feels the clarity of your stillness. A pelvic curl or hips pressing up is her body aligning with you, asking you to build from that anchor. You must learn to read these small cues before adding pressure or angle. This prevents you from overcompensating with hard drive when in reality she needs repeatable accuracy. The metaphor is simple: think of the plank like the floor of a drum—tight, stretched, resonant. If it sags, the rhythm is dull. If it holds its line, every strike vibrates clear.
Depth control matters even more with a below 5 inch shaft. Full extraction or careless rocking risks losing contact entirely, which forces her body to reset and breaks rhythm. Keeping hips close and pressure forward lets you use girth and angle rather than length to give stimulation. Light to Medium force paired with an exhale makes each connection clear, while Hard pressure should be reserved for brief grind moments where her cues show she can absorb it. Joint hygiene also matters here: for an endomorph, keep knees cushioned and wide so hips have room to tilt without stressing lower back or overloading wrists. Reset every few cycles by inhaling in baseline, pulling belly up slightly, and feeling shoulders square again.
In this orientation module, the training is not about performing a fancy move but about holding the posture that allows precision. Every wall contact you will make in later modules will depend on the spine staying straight, hips lifting with breath, and shoulders spreading load instead of dumping it. A simple journal entry could read, “Baseline steady, shallow diagonal, Light pressure, her breath softened at rep three.” That one line holds the information you need to track posture, pressure, depth, and response.

=======================================================================================




Module 2 for The Ngoma is where you break the stroke down into its building blocks—the keystrokes—and train each one until it feels automatic in your body. You always begin in the neutral forearm plank, your chest lifted, shoulders square, hips stable, and shaft resting at a shallow diagonal inside her canal. From here, you isolate each motion one at a time, breathing with it, feeling how it changes the compass wall, depth zone, and pressure. For an endomorph body type, stability is key—your mass wants to sag forward, so the belly must stay lifted off her body and your shoulders must spread to carry load evenly. With a penis under five inches, precision matters more than range; the keystrokes have to keep you inside her walls with no wasted motion or accidental slip-outs.
The first keystroke is the left-lean angling motion. From baseline, you inhale to prepare, then exhale as your hips angle left, which causes the head to press into her right canal wall. This is Angling, not Rocking, because you are tilting the shaft across her axis rather than sliding it forward and back. The contact is in the shallow 80% zone, with Light to Medium pressure so you don’t lever out of her entrance. In tracking phase, this gives you data on how her right wall responds. She may deepen her breath, arch slightly, or press hips toward you when the pressure is clear. For your body type, keep the lean small—belly weight magnifies the angle, so too much tilt risks disengagement. For a short shaft, the clarity of the right wall is what she will feel; it is better to repeat Light to Medium at shallow depth than to push for length.
The second keystroke is the mirror: the right-lean angling motion. Inhale to anchor baseline, exhale to shift hips right so the head presses left wall. Same shallow 80% depth, same Light to Medium pressure. The cue to watch for is if her hips tilt inward or she breathes out softly, which means the left wall stimulation is landing. Again, keep the lean small. Think of it like leaning your hip against a doorframe—just enough to make pressure, not enough to collapse through. Endomorph leverage makes even small shifts feel heavy to her, so let breath guide intensity. For below-average size, this is where girth and angle do the work of length, so steady shallow pressure is your ally.
After left and right comes the triple grind. From baseline, you exhale and press pelvis forward into her body, then Rock the shaft left-to-right across walls, brushing right, then north, then south. This is a Rocking motion rather than pure Angling. Each grind stays in the shallow 80%, with a brief crest into the mid 10% if your cues tell you she wants more. Pressure here is Medium, because you are pressing into her body as you grind, but you must feel her softness before committing. The cues are hips pressing back into you or a pelvic curl that welcomes the Rock. For endomorph training, core engagement matters—without it the grind becomes a collapse. With a shorter shaft, keep the grind tight and controlled; wide sweeps risk slipping out. Picture it like polishing a coin with the head of your shaft, small and deliberate circles rather than long slides.
The fourth keystroke is the vertical lift and re-entry. From baseline, inhale to prepare, then exhale as you press hips forward and lift slightly, letting the broad top shelf of your shaft press against her entrance and upper wall. This is Rocking with a vertical element, shallow to mid depth, Light to Medium pressure. Pause at the crest, holding baseline stability, then re-enter on the downward diagonal. She may show stillness or a deep exhale here, cues that the crest created stretch and fullness. For endomorphs, joint hygiene is critical; knees wide and supported prevent lumbar compression. With below-average length, avoid lifting too high, since losing full contact interrupts rhythm. Instead, let the pressure of the shelf and the pause become the effect.
Together, these keystrokes interlock into the Ngoma rhythm, but here you train them separately. Each must feel natural, each must begin and end at neutral baseline. Inhale to reset, exhale through the action. She feels it as clarity: right wall, left wall, grinding sweep, vertical crest. You must feel it as control: stable plank, precise angling, pressure clear but never collapsing. A sample journal entry could read, “Right wall, shallow, Medium, exhale steady, her hips pressed at rep two.” That one sentence tells you angle, depth, pressure, breath, and cue—all the data you need.

=======================================================================================


Module 3 for The Ngoma is where you begin chaining the isolated keystrokes into the full stroke rhythm. You still work from the neutral forearm plank, knees stable, shoulders spread, hips suspended so your weight doesn’t collapse into her. The goal now is to let one keystroke flow into the next without hesitation, while returning to baseline between them so the body never loses clarity or control. For an endomorph body type, this means staying light in the chest and firm in the core so your natural mass doesn’t drag you off the rhythm. With a penis under five inches, sequencing is less about depth variation and more about wall-to-wall clarity—each change in angle must be crisp so she feels distinct shifts of stimulation instead of one blurred pressure.
The sequence begins with the left-lean angle into her right wall. Exhale through the tilt, let the head brush and hold, then inhale to pull hips back to baseline. Immediately flow into the second keystroke: right-lean into her left wall, again with exhale to press and inhale to return. This left-right pairing creates the opening rhythm, like a drummer tapping alternating sticks on two drums. She feels alternating pressure on her inner walls, which sets her nervous system to expect swing and contrast. If her breath deepens or hips roll, it tells you the alternating pressure is landing. With your size, keep both tilts shallow, staying inside the 80% zone so you never risk disengagement.
From baseline after the second lean, flow into the triple grind. Here you exhale, press pelvis in, and Rock head across right, then north, then south. Keep each grind tight, no more than a coin’s width of sweep, so the shaft stays anchored inside her. She will often exhale softly or still her body when the sweep brushes the north wall, a sign the top is giving her stretch. Because your shaft length is limited, the Rock must be deliberate; a lazy grind risks slipping out. Return to neutral baseline after the sweep, re-centering hips so your weight is lifted and balanced before chaining forward.
The final keystroke in sequence is the vertical lift. Exhale as you press hips forward and lift slightly, letting the top shelf press into her entrance and crest the upper wall. Hold for a half-second pause, then inhale as you re-enter at the starting downward diagonal. She may respond with a pelvic curl or by pressing hips forward, cues that the lift and pause created fullness. For endomorph stability, spread knees wide and use core engagement to protect your spine. With below-average length, the pause at crest replaces what longer shafts achieve with depth—here it is the intensity of the pause and the firmness of pressure that makes her body open.
When you practice chaining, keep the rhythm slow: left lean, baseline, right lean, baseline, grind sweep, baseline, vertical lift and crest, baseline. Each inhale-exhale cycle anchors the pacing. Over time, shorten the baselines so the rhythm begins to loop smoothly without pauses. She will feel it as a continuous dance of walls and angles, while you remain steady in posture and breath. A sample journal entry could be, “Left wall shallow Medium, exhale steady, grind north pulled her breath long at rep three.” This tells you where the sequence connected and how she showed it.

=======================================================================================




Module 4 for The Ngoma is where you begin to run the SSP process inside the shallow 80% zone, treating each keystroke like an experiment you are refining. From your neutral forearm-plank baseline, you pick one wall or diagonal and give it a controlled mini-set, then pause to read her body and track her cues. For an endomorph body type, staying elevated in the chest and steady in the hips is the key safeguard—your natural mass can overload joints or compress her if you collapse. With a penis under five inches, the shallow 80% zone is not a limitation but a training ground for precision. Every shallow contact you make must be distinct enough that she can feel a clear difference in pressure from one wall to the next.
Begin by defining a hypothesis: for example, “If I grind north at Medium pressure with a steady exhale, she will breathe deeper.” Hold neutral, inhale to prepare, then exhale as you Rock into that north wall. Run four slow reps, resetting baseline each time. Track her cues—if her breath catches longer on the third, you note it. If her hips press back into you, you confirm the wall is resonating. After the set, inhale back to neutral and reflect: Did the response match your hypothesis, or does the adjustment need to be made? This is the SSP loop in real time—define, track, refine.
The same method applies when you test the lateral angles. Lean left to point right and brush the right wall, always exhaling through the contact and inhaling back to center. With your size, these shallow sweeps should be Light-to-Medium pressure, never Hard, because you want her to feel clean wall differentiation instead of a blunt push. Her cues might be subtle: a pelvic curl when you touch the right wall, or stillness when you sweep the south. You record that in your journal as one-line shorthand like, “Right wall shallow Medium, exhale, pelvic curl on rep two.” This shorthand becomes your lab notes to refine each wall.
Protect your body during tracking by keeping knees wide, shoulders over elbows, and spine neutral. For an endomorph frame, fatigue comes from holding tension too long, so build mini-sets of three to four reps per wall, then reset baseline for a breath or two. This spacing prevents collapse and keeps your posture crisp. With below-average length, stay disciplined about never overshooting into the mid zone unless cues strongly invite it. The shallow 80% is your proving ground, where clarity and control are more valuable than depth. Each rep builds evidence, each reset clears the slate, and every note you take makes the next loop sharper.
Ready to proceed to Module 5 for The Ngoma with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches?


=======================================================================================






Module 5 for The Ngoma is where you step into flow, sustaining rhythm inside the shallow zone with the option of touching mid only when her body clearly invites it. For an endomorph frame, the task here is to harness your natural weight into steady rocking without letting it collapse your baseline. Keep your chest lifted, shoulders aligned with elbows, and hips carrying the movement, not your spine. This posture protects your joints and lets the pressure translate cleanly through your pelvis. With a penis under five inches, shallow work is your home base; mid access is possible but only through clear cues, so you must master flow inside the shallow 80% before chasing depth.
Begin by breathing yourself into a rhythm. Inhale at neutral, exhale through contact, inhale back to reset. The lateral Angling keystrokes—lean left to point right, lean right to point left—become your compass anchors. Flow means you no longer stop after each set; instead, you chain them together in a loop, sweeping shallow diagonals and returning to the center in one continuous wave. Keep pressure in the Light-to-Medium band, exhaling through each glide, and let your hips Rock subtly between angles. She should feel a consistent massage, like her walls are being stroked in time to her breath, and her cues will tell you if you are tuned in: a deeper exhale, her pelvis curling into you, or stillness that says you have found resonance.
Once you have stability laterally, add the grind sequence from neutral: pelvis pressed in, sweep right wall, lift slightly north, then drop south. For endomorphs this grind must come from hips, not shoulders, or the weight will fold forward. Keep it slow, Medium pressure, and match each grind to a full exhale. With below-average length, this grind is gold—it emphasizes contact variation without leaving the shallow zone, giving her the sensation of north-south range even without deep reach. The cues may come as a stronger pelvic tilt or her hips holding steady under you. Reflect on these signs: if she curls harder during the north sweep, spend more time there in the loop. If she stills on the south drop, repeat that with deliberate pacing. Journal it as a single line such as, “South grind shallow, Medium, stillness held, three reps.”
Flow demands stamina, and for an endomorph body that means pacing. Work in cycles of six to eight breaths, then reset to neutral for one deep inhale. This keeps your posture crisp and prevents joints from carrying dead weight. Let your rhythm become natural, like the slow swing of a pendulum, always anchored to breath. Flow is where the stroke begins to feel less like a drill and more like music, but your discipline in baseline resets and journaling is what keeps it precise and effective. Every loop builds her arousal while sharpening your control.
Ready to proceed to Module 6 for The Ngoma with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches?


=======================================================================================




Module 6 for The Ngoma is where you test the deep option with full awareness, using control rather than force. The goal is not to chase depth but to learn whether the mid and deep 10% zones are available without strain. For an endomorph body, your natural weight gives you leverage to drive through, but that leverage must be carefully restrained. With a penis under five inches, depth gating is even stricter. You cannot rely on length to cross distance, so you must use compass angles and pelvic rocking to simulate reach while staying safe.
Start from a stable forearm-plank, knees balanced, chest lifted, and breath anchoring your rhythm. Reset into this neutral baseline before every new attempt at depth. Begin in the shallow 80%, using a rocking motion south into the posterior wall with Light pressure, exhaling on each push and inhaling on the return. This primes the tissues and checks lubrication. Once you feel her breath deepen or her hips press forward, shift into a shallow-to-mid probe by angling diagonally north-east or north-west. The diagonal creates a sense of length, even at below-five inches, because the shaft is pressing across rather than straight in. Keep pressure Medium only, never Hard, and back out to shallow immediately if her hips lock or her breath catches sharp.
When exploring the mid 10%, limit yourself to two to three strokes before resetting to shallow. Think of it like dipping your toes into a pool rather than diving in. Your body mass may tempt you to lean forward, but that collapses the joint load into your shoulders and forces depth. Instead, drive from the hips while keeping your chest proud and your forearms light. This prevents strain on your lower back and keeps the compass navigation precise. Journal it in shorthand with one line such as “NE-Mid@3, hips still” to mark three mid-zone tests on the north-east diagonal with no forward press from her hips.
The deep 10% is not a default option here. With a shorter length, it only becomes possible if her pelvic curl pulls you in and lubrication is abundant. If you sense the cervix, back out immediately. For an endomorph body, forcing through risks injury to both of you because your leverage is too heavy to finesse once resistance meets hard tissue. The deep option, when available, is best explored with rocking rather than pulsing, using Light pressure only and a full exhale to soften your own drive.
Reflect on what this expansion means. The point of the deep option is not to conquer space but to show her that you can pace the full range of her canal without fear. Even when you cannot always reach deep, the act of testing, resetting, and returning to shallow proves mastery. She feels that you are in command of the limits, not blindly pushing. That confidence, more than depth itself, is what she remembers.

=======================================================================================




Module 7 for The Ngoma is where you learn how to hold her arousal after orgasm and spark multiples by using precision, not speed. Think of this stage as pinning down the moment when her nerves are open and raw, then tweaking just enough to keep the current flowing. The goal is short, controlled bursts with reflection pauses, always cycling back to baseline so the body never feels overwhelmed.
Begin from your neutral forearm-plank baseline, hips steady and chest lifted. Keep the shallow 80% as your anchor because after orgasm her canal is most sensitive near the entrance. Use rocking rather than thrusting, with Light pressure, exhaling on the forward rock and inhaling on the return. Watch for the simple cues: her breath might hitch, her hips may curl slightly, or she may hold still. Stillness here is not withdrawal—it is her nervous system bracing for the next wave.
To spark multiples, apply the SSP loop: observe, tweak, test. If her hips press into you, maintain the angle but increase pressure from Light to Medium for two or three strokes, then pause. If her hips stay still, try a micro-angle shift, moving from the east wall to the north-east diagonal, then hold there for three shallow strokes with slow exhalations. Always return to neutral after each burst so her body has a clear reset point. Journal with one line like “SE→NE shift@3, hips curled” to capture the angle change and her cue.
As an endomorph, your weight can collapse the rhythm if you lean in too heavily after her orgasm. Keep your chest proud and shoulders light, letting the drive come from hips and thighs, not upper body weight. With a penis under five inches, the shallow zone becomes your greatest advantage. You can stay in constant contact with the nerve-rich entrance while using angles to mimic newness. This lets you extend her orgasm without ever needing to chase depth.
Reflection is key. After each mini-burst, notice her breathing, the tension in her thighs, or the way her pelvis lifts or drops. Each cue tells you whether to tweak angle, pressure, or tempo. By moving in this cycle—burst, observe, reset—you transform a single orgasm into a chain. What she feels is not a single high but a rolling current, like drumbeats that refuse to stop. And what she remembers is that you knew exactly how to pin her body into opening again and again.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for The Ngoma with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Below 5 inches?


=======================================================================================




Module 8 for The Ngoma is where practice becomes a plan, a cycle you can follow week by week to lock the stroke into muscle memory. This is about discipline, not improvisation. You already know the keystrokes and the rhythm logic. Now you’ll layer them in a way that builds stamina, precision, and sensitivity without burning out your body.
Start with orientation each session. Sink into forearm plank, align shoulders over elbows, spine long, hips steady, and breathe three cycles. This baseline is not warmup fluff—it is your safeguard. For an endomorph body, the temptation will be to sag or lean, so you must commit to alignment every time. A penis under five inches needs clarity of angle more than reach, so your neutral must stay clean if you want her walls to register the difference between east, west, and diagonal touches.
Week one is about isolating keystrokes. Train the left rock, the right rock, the grind, and the vertical lift as separate sets. Keep them shallow at 80%, Light to Medium pressure, and no more than six to eight strokes per set with full breath cycles. Journal one line after each set, for example: “Right rock, shallow, Medium, hips pressed.” Your focus is not speed or endurance but clarity. You want each keystroke to be recognizable, like letters you are learning to write cleanly.
Week two is chaining. Begin to pair keystrokes into short sequences—the left rock into center reset, or grind into vertical lift and re-entry. Still keep them shallow and always return to neutral. Let the breath lead the sequence: inhale on the reset, exhale on the action. Her cues will tell you if the sequence lands. If she exhales or curls hips in, you repeat that chain. If she grows still or pulls back, you reset and test another.
Week three is about flow. Now you string the chains into rhythm, staying mostly in shallow but testing mid zone if lubrication, angle, and her body cues allow. With your size, the mid 10% is a tactical option, not a base. Use it as contrast. Spend most of the cycle shallow, then drop briefly into mid and return. This push-pull makes the shallow strokes feel sharper to her. Keep your breath steady, exhale through strokes, inhale during pauses, and journal with shorthand like “Grind→Lift, mid dip@4, deep sigh.”
Week four introduces pinning and recovery. Practice short bursts of controlled angle or pressure shifts after simulated orgasm cues. Do three strokes, pause in shallow, observe, then tweak and re-test. This is where you refine her multiple waves. You must also honor rest hygiene. With your heavier frame, set a twenty-stroke cap before resting in baseline, hips high and chest lifted, letting wrists and shoulders reset. This is how you train without strain.
What she will feel across these four weeks is a man who has sharpened his control, each week layering new clarity onto the stroke. What you build is a skill set that will not fade, because it is rooted in baseline alignment, keystroke mastery, and breath-led rhythm. Your journal is the map of this progress, a record of angles, pressures, and cues that show how her body responds.
