This module teaches orientation and body setup for the Plank Scrape, anchoring your foundation so every movement later feels clean, stable, and precise. Start in a forearm-plank position, elbows under shoulders, forearms flat, palms relaxed. Your spine should form one line from head to heels, not sagging or arching. This alignment matters more than strength—it allows the pelvis to rock and angle without strain. Inhale deeply to lengthen the body, exhale to settle weight evenly through your core and thighs. The plank is your baseline, the point from which all scraping motion emerges and to which you’ll always return.
Now focus on load management. As a mesomorph, your natural strength can become your biggest obstacle. Your body can overpower your control if tension gathers in the shoulders or glutes. Keep your abs engaged but not rigid, your hips floating so that the movement comes from the pelvis, not the back. Imagine your body as a suspension bridge—strong yet flexible. Breathe into that bridge. Every exhale should soften the ribs and draw the navel slightly in, grounding the line without collapsing it. This breath anchor will later control pressure, pacing, and stamina.
From this neutral baseline, explore micro-rocks forward and back along the horizontal line of your plank. Each rock is a rehearsal of the motion that drives the scrape. The goal is not penetration depth but awareness—feeling how a one-inch forward lean changes the tension in your abs and the angle of your pelvis. Keep it light and shallow, working only in the top 80%. Inhale as you shift forward, exhale as you return. You’ll start to notice how the contact changes along the compass: north-northwest when your hips lean left, north-northeast when they lean right. These small differences teach wall clarity—the ability to know exactly which surface of her body you’re working against before rhythm begins.
Stay aware of joint stacking. Wrists and elbows must stay aligned so the shoulders don’t collapse. If you feel pressure in the wrists, spread the fingers and push lightly through the forearms. The spine should remain long, the hips level. This setup prevents fatigue and preserves precision later when rhythm gets faster. When you sense tension creeping up the back or shoulders, pause, reset, breathe, and rebuild the line. Every reset re-educates your nervous system to find neutrality faster.
Depth control begins here. For a penis in the 5–7 inch range, the sweet spot of contact lies within the shallow-to-mid transition zone. That means staying in the 80–90% range for most training, avoiding full compression into the pelvis. This range keeps clarity high and prevents losing friction against the wall. When working in this zone, use Medium pressure at most, Light for Tracking, and only brief moments of Hard during controlled Flow or Pinning. Think of your depth limit like the edge of a cliff—you can lean over it, but you don’t jump.
Each breath teaches control. When you inhale, lengthen your body without moving your pelvis; when you exhale, let the hips float slightly toward the floor, testing gravity’s pull. She would feel this as a smooth settling of pressure, not an impact. If her breath deepens or her hips subtly roll upward, you’ve found the right weight. This sensitivity is how you’ll measure connection, not just movement.
Your reflection for this module is simple: every strong structure begins with stillness. You’re not just holding plank—you’re learning how stability creates freedom. The more efficiently you hold your baseline, the longer and cleaner your rhythm will feel when you add motion. Write one journal line after each session like, “Neutral hold@3min → hips steady, breath deep, shoulders easy.” That sentence becomes your calibration log.
Module 1 of the Plank Scrape begins with posture—the kind of setup that protects your joints and builds the leverage this stroke depends on. Drop into a forearm plank with your elbows directly under your shoulders and your forearms parallel, hands relaxed but alive. Your legs should be straight, glutes engaged, spine long from crown to heel. The mesomorph frame gives you strong core stability but can overload your shoulders if you sink too deep. Keep a soft lock in the elbows, not rigid, and feel the tension spread evenly across chest, abs, and thighs. This is your neutral baseline. Every motion will start and end here. Breathe in through the nose to fill the ribs laterally, then exhale through the mouth to anchor the lower abdomen against the spine. Each breath defines the tempo for the entire stroke rhythm later on.
From this position, learn to feel your weight shift microscopically through your pelvis without collapsing the line of the spine. The Plank Scrape’s power comes from sliding along the compass line between north (her clitoral ridge) and south (posterior wall), never lifting out of the depth band once you’re inside. In this module, that directional sense begins as a dry drill: imagine your pelvis as a smooth pendulum moving along that line. Rocking creates motion, angling creates pressure. The scrape itself will later emerge from the combination of those two, but now it’s just awareness training. The shallow 80% zone is your practice field; keep your imaginary tip just brushing against the anterior wall. Medium pressure only. If you press harder than that, you’ll break alignment and lose the wall clarity that gives this stroke its name.
Because you’re working with a mid-sized penis—five to seven inches—you have the advantage of depth flexibility without risk of cervix collision. Even so, never chase full depth in this orientation phase. The 80–10–10 principle keeps you safe: eighty percent of the time, stay shallow; ten percent, touch the mid zone; ten percent, test a slightly deeper angle when your hips are fully warmed. This rhythm teaches your body how to measure space by feel instead of sight. For mesomorphs, the challenge is over-muscling. So stay patient. Let gravity teach your lower abs to hang from the breath rather than push from tension. Inhale to lengthen your body line; exhale to stabilize. If you feel the shoulders burning, reset to neutral plank and shake out for ten seconds before reengaging.
What you’re learning here is the foundation for wall sensitivity. The plank isolates your core and forces the pressure feedback into your pelvic floor, not your arms. The more stable your base, the cleaner your read on resistance, suction, or glide when you’re inside her later. Think of this module as sanding a table before varnishing—it’s tedious but every imperfection you remove now will make the surface smoother under pressure. Spend three to five minutes at a time holding, rocking, resetting. Breathe evenly and note how your body begins to find the low hum between effort and stillness. That hum is the same rhythm you’ll match to her breathing once you’re connected. Journal one line when you finish: “Plank baseline held for ___ seconds before shoulder fatigue — L@10.”
This module is about patience and calibration. You’re not learning to move yet; you’re learning to feel the stillness that gives movement precision. Once your neutral plank feels natural and your breath stays calm through thirty seconds of sustained alignment, you’ve earned the right to build motion on top.

===================================================================================
Module 2 of the Plank Scrape teaches you the keystrokes—the simple body actions that become the stroke’s foundation. Think of these as gears inside a machine. Each one must move cleanly on its own before they can work together. The first keystroke is the Core Rock. From your forearm plank baseline, inhale and let the hips drift forward an inch, keeping the spine rigid and abs locked. Exhale as you draw the hips back, scraping the imaginary shaft along the inner wall line from north to south. This is a Rocking movement—your pelvis stays level, the angle constant, the motion driven entirely by your abs and glutes. Keep it in the shallow 80% depth zone for now. The medium pressure you feel in your forearms is mirrored by what she’ll eventually feel on her anterior wall—a firm glide without punch. The mesomorph frame should resist the temptation to overdrive the motion; let your hips float, not thrust. The rhythm is a slow three-count: forward on one, pause on two, back on three, then reset.
The second keystroke is the Angle Tilt. It refines where that scrape lands. From the neutral plank, rotate your pelvis slightly clockwise, right hip lowering by half an inch while your left side rises. Exhale during the tilt; inhale to return to level. This is an Angling movement, and it’s what later lets you drag the upper-left quadrant of her wall diagonally toward center. Stay shallow, using light pressure only. The mesomorph’s strength should stabilize, not muscle through—feel the shift in your obliques instead of your quads. Practice the opposite tilt, counterclockwise, to map the left and right compass diagonals. Think of these diagonals as the edges of a shallow dish you’re learning to polish—smooth, patient, consistent. If you feel shoulder fatigue, drop to your knees, shake out, then rebuild alignment.
The third keystroke is the Anchor Reset. This is your breath and baseline recovery. From whichever tilt or rock you’ve finished, stop and let the hips settle. Inhale fully through the nose, expanding the ribs and tightening the abdomen as if bracing for impact. Exhale slowly and press the forearms into the ground, lengthening the spine again. This trains your nervous system to mark the end of each cycle and prevents sloppy transitions later. For mesomorphs, this reset keeps the spine decompressed and prevents lumbar compression. Keep the rhythm honest: one slow inhale, one slow exhale, then reengage the Rock or Tilt.
Now chain them lightly. Rock forward and back once, tilt clockwise, reset, then tilt counterclockwise, reset. This simple loop is the skeleton of the Plank Scrape. You’re mapping how Rocking gives you glide and how Angling changes texture. The shallow 80% zone is the sweet spot; the scrape’s magic comes from staying near the front wall while your pressure slides laterally across it. With your mid-size length, this band gives full sensation range without losing control. Journal one line after each set: “R→T→Reset x10 cycles — M@80.”
This phase is about making every keystroke distinct and repeatable. Once each action feels like part of your breath rather than a task, the stroke begins to form naturally. Your body will know where each motion lives before your mind names it. That’s the beginning of muscle literacy—the real mark of mastery.

===================================================================================
Module 3 of the Plank Scrape is where the separate keystrokes fuse into one living rhythm. You’ve learned how to Rock, Tilt, and Reset; now you’ll connect them into a fluid cycle that feels continuous instead of mechanical. Start in your neutral forearm plank. Inhale, stabilize your spine, and on the exhale begin the forward Core Rock—hips glide an inch ahead, weight moving subtly toward the forearms. Keep the pressure medium, never more than what your abs can control. As you draw the hips back, let that motion melt seamlessly into a slight clockwise Tilt. The right hip drops as you retreat, tracing the north-to-southeast diagonal of her inner wall in your mind. That’s the scrape—the moment when Rock becomes Angle.
Pause for a breath at the back of the cycle. Feel the low ab tension holding the spine firm, then on the next exhale reverse the sequence: Rock forward again and counterclockwise Tilt as you retract. This alternating rhythm—forward rock, angled draw, reset, mirrored return—creates the continuous polish the stroke is known for. It’s not a thrust; it’s a grind through a narrow groove. The mesomorph body type must focus on control rather than power. Use your breath as a metronome: inhale to prepare, exhale through the scrape. Every motion should begin on breath and end with stillness before the next.
Because your length sits in the five-to-seven-inch range, your stroke has room to explore shallow and mid zones without bottoming out. Stay primarily in the shallow 80%, occasionally gliding into the mid 10% when your spine alignment feels perfect. The rhythm should never break form for depth. Think of your pelvis like a paintbrush spreading even pressure on a curved wall. Light and slow makes it glossy; heavy and rushed leaves streaks. Three to five cycles per minute is ideal. After every fifth cycle, Anchor Reset with a full breath and neutral spine to decompress the shoulders.
If you imagine her cues later, they’ll come through subtle feedback: breath deepening, hips drawing toward the motion, small curls at the waist. When you feel your own breath and core tension syncing with that imagined pulse, you’re entering flow territory. The scrape stops being external friction and becomes internal resonance. That’s the first neural upgrade this module delivers—your nervous system linking pelvic motion, wall feedback, and breath control into one seamless loop.
Run this chained stroke for sets of twenty to thirty seconds, rest for ten, then resume. Keep the shallow path clear and quiet; no jerks or thrusts. Journal each run in one line: “Plank Scrape chain held 25s, rhythm steady — M@80.” Over time, your plank will feel like a long exhale stretched across the compass line. This is the stroke’s real beginning: endurance through sensitivity, strength through patience. Ready to proceed to Module 4 for Plank Scrape with Body Type Mesomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


===================================================================================
Module 4 of the Plank Scrape introduces the Tracking Phase—the scientific part of your training where you begin testing how your body and breath create consistent pressure in the shallow 80%. You’ll now run short, repeatable sequences using the SSP framework: define, hypothesize, track, refine. Begin in the forearm plank baseline. Your definition is simple—maintain clean Rock–Tilt cycles without shoulder collapse for thirty seconds. Your hypothesis: if you control breath pacing, your pelvic stability will hold longer and your wall sensitivity will sharpen. That’s what you’ll test.
On the first round, hold the plank still for one deep inhale and exhale to establish baseline tension. On the next inhale, drive a slow forward Rock; on the exhale, draw back through your clockwise Tilt and feel the scrape trace the anterior wall in your mind. Stay in that shallow band. Light-to-medium pressure only. The mesomorph’s danger is overengagement, so monitor whether your thighs and glutes are clenching too hard. If they are, the movement will feel like a push instead of a glide. Soften. On each breath, think of your pelvis moving over oiled glass—smooth and weightless. Do five cycles, then Anchor Reset. Log your sensations right after: “Core stable, minor right-shoulder shake after 20s — L@80.”
Now refine. Adjust one variable per set—angle, breath pace, or pressure—and watch how it changes your control. When you inhale slightly longer, does the Rock feel smoother? When you slow your exhale, do you sense more traction along the front wall? Tracking is about linking cause and effect until every shift becomes predictable. Imagine you’re learning to tune a string instrument; one millimeter of tension changes the whole sound. Here, one breath shift changes the entire scrape texture. You’re training your nervous system to map that difference.
Stay disciplined with the 80–10–10 principle. Every time you feel tempted to drive deeper, pull back and stabilize in the shallow zone. Only when your spine alignment feels perfect can you drop momentarily into mid depth, no further than that. For your five-to-seven-inch range, the difference between shallow and mid is barely an inch—enough to wake new wall receptors without hitting cervix territory. Observe how the friction quality changes; shallow gives suction and warmth, mid gives glide and density. Alternate for one breath cycle at a time and note the contrast.
The journal becomes your lab report. One line per set is enough: “Slowed exhale increased anterior wall stick — M@80→10.” Over time, you’ll start anticipating the wall’s feedback before it happens. That’s mastery emerging—tracking until reflex replaces thought. When your plank holds steady, your breath stays measured, and every scrape feels deliberate, you’re ready for flow.

===================================================================================
Module 5 of the Plank Scrape brings you into the Flow Phase. This is where technique becomes rhythm, and rhythm becomes state. You’re no longer dissecting each keystroke—you’re breathing them. Begin in the neutral forearm plank, eyes soft, spine long. Take one full inhale to settle. On the exhale, drift forward into the Rock, slide back through the clockwise Tilt, and feel the hips begin to find their own natural tempo. Keep it in the shallow 80% for at least the first minute. The mesomorph frame has power to spare, so restraint is your discipline here. Let your hips move as if tracing a calm tide over the front wall—steady, weightless, continuous.
Match each movement to your breath. Inhale through the Rock, exhale through the Tilt. You should feel the air leaving your lungs at the same rate your hips retreat. That synchrony is what creates the sense of endless motion, the signature of flow. The medium pressure band is your friend—it lets you sustain for minutes without burning out your shoulders or overloading your abs. Stay aware of joint load: your elbows grounded, neck long, glutes active. The plank should feel like suspension, not strain.
After two or three minutes, the scrape begins to hum through your whole body. That’s the nervous system syncing to repetition. Once the rhythm feels effortless, experiment with micro-variations in speed, still inside the shallow 80%. Try one sequence at a slightly faster breath tempo, then one slower. You’ll notice how the texture of the glide shifts—the slower motion feels sticky and molten; the faster motion lightens and skims. This sensitivity is your reward for earlier tracking discipline. You’re feeling the wall before it happens.
When your alignment feels precise, you can flirt with the mid 10%. Don’t dive—just slide a fraction deeper on a longer exhale, then retreat. Because your length sits safely within the five-to-seven-inch range, this flirtation awakens mid-zone pressure without breaching comfort. It’s not about penetration; it’s about resonance. Imagine polishing the curve of a bowl—you’re maintaining contact while moving across a rounded surface. That slight depth variation gives her body a pulse to sync with later.
End each session by slowing everything until motion and breath merge. When the hips stop, don’t drop immediately. Hold the plank for two more breaths, spine extended, feeling the heat along your abs. That’s your Flow imprint—the embodied memory that will return faster each practice. Journal it simply: “Flow held steady, breath matched rhythm, smooth at 80→10 — M@80.” When you can enter that state on command, the stroke becomes effortless art.

===================================================================================
Module 6 of the Plank Scrape is the deep option—the point where you explore the final ten percent of range without losing rhythm or awareness. This isn’t about force or dominance; it’s about precision and presence. Begin in the neutral forearm plank baseline and take three full breaths before moving. Your body should feel solid but light, shoulders steady above elbows, hips floating. On the next inhale, begin your forward Rock, and as you exhale, let the pelvis drop a little further into the motion, guiding the shaft into the mid-to-deep zone along the anterior wall. The angle must stay clean—never downward force, always a gliding vector like a plane landing on a runway.
For your mesomorph frame and five-to-seven-inch length, depth expansion means roughly one inch beyond the mid point. No deeper. You’re not chasing cervix contact; you’re tracing just before it. Keep the pressure at medium-hard for one or two cycles, then soften back to medium. The body’s cue for proper depth will be an instinctive shift in her breath pattern—imagine it deepening, a soft exhale through the nose or a pause before she breathes again. If this were live, that’s where her hips might roll subtly toward you. For now, just observe your own breath mimic that pattern. You’re training nervous system empathy—feeling her signals through your own respiratory mirror.
When the scrape reaches this deeper region, your motion must narrow. The Rock shortens, and the Tilt becomes more micro. Think of this as tracing the inner rim of a chalice. You’re no longer sweeping; you’re polishing. The goal is to maintain contact and control without collapsing your plank. Keep your elbows pressed gently into the mat to distribute load through the forearms and core, protecting your lower back. Each exhale should last the entire scrape; each inhale re-centers you at neutral.
Because you’re a mesomorph, fatigue will come from sustaining tension too long. Every thirty seconds, Anchor Reset: lift hips slightly, take one full breath, and let the abdominal pressure dissipate before resuming. This prevents shoulder and hip overload. As you return to depth, visualize sliding along the north-to-south diagonal at mid 10%, never jamming straight ahead. That slight diagonal preserves glide and keeps your motion smooth instead of percussive.
What she would feel in this phase is saturation—a steady, full-body heat, the sense that each motion fills space instead of piercing it. You’ll notice your own breathing slow, your senses sharpen, and your internal rhythm quiet. That’s the somatic cue that you’re operating in safe, sustainable depth. Record your run afterward: “Deep 10% maintained, glide stable, heat rising — H@10.” The key reflection here is that depth never equals dominance; depth equals presence. It’s the patience to stay connected when everything in your body wants to push harder. Ready to proceed to Module 7 for Plank Scrape with Body Type Mesomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


===================================================================================
Module 7 of the Plank Scrape is the Pinning Phase—the post-orgasm strategy and mastery of control. This is where the man learns to hold rhythm through the body’s natural urge to collapse. Begin again in your forearm plank baseline, but this time, your focus is stillness within movement. You’ve already built strength, flow, and depth control; now you’ll apply the SSP loop—Observe, Tweak, Test—to refine micro-pressure and angle without losing composure. The plank becomes your crucible. Every breath you hold steady here extends the life of the rhythm, even when your system wants to break.
Start with light rocking, shallow at 80%. As you approach fatigue, inhale to prepare, and exhale through the pelvic Tilt as though releasing tension through the floor. You’ll feel the pressure build in your abdomen and thighs; that’s your signal to micro-adjust. Pivot your hips five to ten degrees to either side, finding which diagonal preserves glide and contact with minimal effort. This is Pinning—the skill of staying present by shifting instead of stopping. Keep your eyes closed if it helps. You’re tracing sensation maps, not chasing finish lines.
Because your body type is mesomorphic, the temptation is to drive or tense to maintain rhythm. Don’t. Pinning rewards softness over strain. Imagine your pelvis as a weightless pendulum, hanging from a string at your navel. Each swing happens from breath, not muscle. The goal is to feel suspended, balanced between contraction and release. As the movements get smaller, your perception sharpens—you’ll start feeling micro-changes in friction, temperature, and muscular tone. That’s the body’s version of acoustic feedback. Every adjustment you make teaches you what sustains arousal without aggression.
For your five-to-seven-inch range, this is the perfect phase to master depth gating. Alternate between shallow 80% and a teasing mid 10% in five-breath cycles. Each transition should feel like drawing a bowstring—tension on the inhale, release on the exhale. Notice when your own breath and heart rate sync; that’s the neurological plateau you’re building toward. If done right, this produces the same internal calm as meditation under load. The plank’s alignment—wrists under shoulders, spine straight, hips hovering—keeps your system honest. Any deviation means fatigue has arrived, and that’s when mastery starts: maintaining clean motion even as the body shakes.
When you sense your energy cresting, don’t pull out of the rhythm. Shorten it. Half-length strokes, shallow pressure, light exhale. Stay inside the same pattern for three more breaths. You’ll feel the tremor fade and control return. That’s the moment of post-orgasm re-entry—the proof that you command the rhythm, not the other way around. Log it as prose: “Pinning held through fatigue, micro-angle 10° right kept flow alive — M@80.” Reflect that every set ends with composure, not collapse. When you can stay steady through the shake, you’ve earned the title of rhythmic master. Ready to proceed to Module 8 for Plank Scrape with Body Type Mesomorph and Penis Size 5–7 inches?


===================================================================================
Module 8 of the Plank Scrape is full integration—the four-week cycle that turns this stroke from training into instinct. Think of it as teaching your nervous system to recognize the Plank Scrape as home base, a movement it can enter without hesitation or thought. Begin each week anchored in the same ritual: forearm plank, spine long, inhale for four counts, exhale for six. This breath ratio sets the rhythm baseline and reminds your system that control begins with calm. You’ll work in cycles of intensity—alternating between flow and rest—to engrain endurance without strain.
In week one, live in orientation. Focus on perfect plank structure. Keep your forearms grounded, neck aligned, hips hovering just above neutral. The scrape motion should feel like sandpaper polishing glass—smooth, slow, consistent. Stay in the shallow 80% exclusively. The goal here is imprinting posture and breath, not speed or depth. Practice for three sets of ninety seconds, resting sixty seconds between. Each set ends with one journal line, such as: “Stable plank, pressure medium, breath led hips — M@80.”
Week two adds in keystroke threading. You’ll chain your Rock and Tilt motions from earlier modules into a small rhythm loop. Two Rocks, one Tilt, one reset to baseline—repeat. Work for two minutes, then pause for a breath anchor. The mesomorph frame gives you leverage but can over-tighten at the core, so between sets, lift hips, stretch shoulders, and let the abs soften. You’re teaching fluidity, not flexing strength.
By week three, begin flowing. Five-minute sessions, two per day. Alternate shallow 80% and mid 10% exploration every thirty seconds. Keep pressure Medium to Medium-Hard, exhaling through the forward drive and inhaling on retreat. The five-to-seven-inch range allows you to stay in safe mid-zone glide without losing wall contact. The plank should feel like hovering flight—motion glides, breath steadies, mind quiets. Expect shoulder fatigue; that’s natural. It’s your signal to pause, rest, and restart with renewed stability.
In week four, integrate pinning. Your task is to sustain rhythm through fatigue or distraction. Begin each session at a normal flow, and when you feel the urge to stop, simply shorten range and soften pressure instead. Stay in the movement, eyes closed, breath long. You’re conditioning your body to respond with adjustment, not collapse. Record each result simply: “Stayed fluid under fatigue, range stable, mind quiet — H@10.”
Across all weeks, honor rest hygiene. Mesomorphic bodies build tension fast; recovery must match intensity. After each practice, lie flat for sixty seconds, breathing slowly until your pulse settles. This rest seals the imprint into your nervous system. By the end of the month, the Plank Scrape should feel like a language your body speaks fluently—one that carries power, precision, and patience. You’ll move without thought, correct without analysis, and sustain connection without strain. The practice becomes identity. The stroke becomes you.
