Module 1 focuses on orientation and body setup, teaching how to build the foundation that allows the Zig Zag stroke to be performed safely, smoothly, and with precision. Begin in forearm plank, knees resting gently on the canvas. The spine should form a straight line from crown to tailbone, and the hips should float a few inches above her pelvis without collapsing into her body weight. For an ectomorph, this position prevents energy leaks through overextension. The arms take the role of stabilizers rather than levers. Breathing starts with an inhale through the nose to lengthen the torso, followed by an exhale through the mouth that lets the hips soften and settle naturally toward the north-south axis.
From this neutral plank, you’ll learn how to align your pelvis to find the correct penetration angle. Because the Zig Zag works along her north wall, your entry point should form a slight downward diagonal—think of tracing a shallow line toward her belly button rather than driving straight in. With a penis below five inches, the goal isn’t deep thrust but consistent contact. That’s why depth stays within the shallow 80% zone. Pressure starts Light, only increasing to Medium when the contact stays steady through a full breath. If you feel a bounce or slip, the angle is off; correct it by adjusting the tilt of your hips rather than pushing harder. Your breath becomes the metronome—inhale to prepare, exhale to glide, pause briefly before inhaling again to reset.
As the body moves, Rocking and Angling become your two control tools. Rocking happens as the hips glide forward and back, while Angling happens through micro-tilts that direct the penis along the wall’s contour. In the Zig Zag, both combine like steering and acceleration. For ectomorphs, lighter mass makes control easier, but joint protection is crucial—wrists stacked under shoulders, elbows soft, and core engaged so that no load drops into the lower back. Between movements, always return to neutral plank. This reset prevents fatigue and trains your nervous system to associate stillness with control. The sensation should feel like floating above the canvas with energy running through your arms rather than compressing into your hips.
Internally, this setup creates balance between stability and adaptability. When the plank alignment holds, you can feel the subtle cues of her body—the deeper breath, the upward roll of her hips, or the way her exhale softens when the angle lands right. Those moments confirm that your alignment and depth are clear. For an ectomorph, stamina protection comes from rhythm pacing rather than force. Work in short, steady sets of five to seven strokes, then pause to inhale and re-center. The pause isn’t rest; it’s precision calibration.
A simple metaphor can help: imagine painting a line across a wall with a small brush. If you press too hard, the bristles splay and the line smudges. If you stay light and steady, each pass becomes clean and deliberate. The same logic applies to pelvic control here. You’re painting with the top shelf of your penis, not hammering with it.
As you practice this setup, keep the journaling shorthand concise and repeatable: “North wall, shallow 80%, Light pressure, hips aligned, smoother exhale at rep six.” That one line captures your compass, depth, pressure, and observed cue. Over time, these notes become your diagnostic trail for refinement.
By mastering this foundational orientation, you guarantee that every keystroke later lands with accuracy and stamina efficiency. The neutral forearm plank becomes your home base—a safe and repeatable posture that gives you control, endurance, and sensory clarity before you start chaining movements into rhythm.

===========================================================================================


Module 2 focuses on breaking down the Zig Zag stroke into its specific keystrokes, teaching you how to isolate and train each building block before you chain them together into rhythm. Begin again in forearm plank, knees resting on the canvas, pelvis hovering just above hers. The first keystroke is the North Drop, which sets the angle of entry. From neutral, inhale to lengthen the torso and exhale as you tilt your hips slightly downward, guiding the penis head along the north wall at a shallow diagonal. This movement combines both Rocking and Angling; the rock drives the motion, while the angle defines direction. Because you’re an ectomorph with a shorter lever, depth remains within the shallow 80% zone, emphasizing clarity of wall contact over penetration. She’ll respond with a subtle deep breath or an upward tilt of her hips when the head traces correctly; if she stiffens or breath halts, lighten pressure and reset. The goal here is smooth precision, not force.
The second keystroke is the Shuttle Glide. From the base of the North Drop, use your forearms to gently shuttle your body forward and back while maintaining consistent contact with her north wall. The penis moves laterally across the wall like a paintbrush crossing a stroke, giving her a broad, massaging feel rather than a jab. Pressure should stay Light to Medium, coordinated with breath—inhale as you prepare, exhale through the forward glide. This keystroke teaches you to distribute energy through the whole plank rather than through the hips alone. For an ectomorph, shoulder and triceps endurance becomes key; maintain micro-core engagement to prevent collapsing into the hips. You’ll know the wall pressure is right when her breath becomes audible and hips begin to roll slightly toward you.
Next comes the Reverse Shuttle, which teaches extraction control. Instead of lifting out, push backward through your forearms as your hips draw back, keeping the top shelf of your penis in firm contact with the north wall. Think of it as drawing a smooth line backward while keeping the tip engaged. The Rocking quality dominates here with minimal angle change. Keep pressure Medium during the back glide and Light during reset. This teaches sensitivity to friction consistency and prevents overstimulation of surface tissue. For a shorter length, this keystroke ensures you stay connected without breaking rhythm.
The final keystroke is the Lift Reset. Once the penis returns to shallow range, inhale deeply and slightly lift your chest to relieve pressure before dropping back to neutral plank. This small lift reestablishes circulation in the arms and allows blood flow to normalize in the pelvis. It’s not a withdrawal, but a reset—a moment to prepare for another round of Shuttle Glides. She may release a small sigh or show a slight relaxation when this reset is clean; those are confirmation cues. For an ectomorph, this lift also relieves cumulative load on the shoulders, which prevents early fatigue.
To train these keystrokes, practice them in this order: North Drop, Shuttle Glide, Reverse Shuttle, Lift Reset. The logic is anatomical—each builds on the stability of the previous. The North Drop sets the correct angle; the Shuttle Glide builds range; the Reverse Shuttle trains sustained contact; the Lift Reset maintains endurance. Work each keystroke in sets of five to seven repetitions before returning to full rest. Focus on breath anchoring rather than tempo, since breath defines stability. The interplay of inhale and exhale naturally paces your rhythm and maintains control without mental counting.
She will likely feel the Zig Zag’s distinctive “skating” texture—pressure that sweeps and rolls rather than pounds. Your job is to stay in sync with her cues: if her hips press up, maintain angle; if she exhales deeply or softens, stay in that compass and sustain tempo. Journal in one line to mark your calibration: “North wall 80%, Medium pressure, even breath, hips rolled at rep five.” That single line captures cause and effect for your next refinement.
Mastering these keystrokes will give you the foundation to construct the full Zig Zag rhythm without confusion or strain. Each movement teaches you how to stay stable, control pressure, and maintain sensory clarity even within shallow depth. Once these fundamentals are embodied, you’ll be ready to weave them into the continuous sequence that defines the full stroke.

===========================================================================================




Module 3 focuses on building the complete Zig Zag stroke from the keystrokes you’ve just learned, turning them from isolated drills into a living rhythm. Start in your neutral forearm plank with knees supported, spine long, and pelvis aligned over hers. Inhale through the nose to center, and on the exhale, perform the North Drop—let the hips tilt slightly downward to reestablish the northward diagonal. Keep your chest lifted just enough to maintain forearm tension. As soon as contact lands cleanly, slide directly into the Shuttle Glide, using the forearms to guide your upper body forward so the top shelf of your penis sweeps across her north wall. This forward motion should feel like a smooth rock rather than a thrust; the hips follow the line of the arms while maintaining a shallow depth zone, around 80%. The sensation on her end should feel like warmth spreading across the north wall, not a puncture.
When you reach the farthest range of the glide, maintain that connection and reverse direction without pause. Engage the Reverse Shuttle by pulling your body backward through the forearms, maintaining steady Medium pressure as the top shelf continues to massage her north wall. The spine stays neutral, the movement small and intentional. The breath pattern mirrors your direction: exhale forward, inhale backward. This keeps your nervous system regulated and prevents unnecessary tension. As you complete the backward glide and reenter shallow territory, perform the Lift Reset—inhale, lift the chest slightly, relieve pressure, and let your body float back to baseline. This reset is your anchor; it preserves clarity of contact and prevents fatigue in your shoulders and core.
For an ectomorph, leverage comes from length and precision, not brute force. Your limbs are longer, and that gives you mechanical advantage if you stay within your range. Avoid overextending; keep strokes compact, focused on friction and feel. Because the penis is below five inches, depth gating is natural—you’re meant to maximize surface contact with the north wall, not chase deep zones. Use the full surface area, especially the upper shaft and ridge, to deliver broad, sweeping sensations. When performed correctly, she’ll respond with deepening breath, hips subtly tilting upward, or a soft hum of approval.
The full Zig Zag rhythm follows a breath-timed sequence: inhale at baseline, exhale through the forward glide, inhale during the return, and reset with a light chest lift. Each cycle should take roughly five to six seconds, allowing body and breath to sync. Think of the rhythm like tracing a curved S on the north wall, each side balanced by breath and muscle memory. If her breath catches or her hips suddenly press hard into you, maintain angle but ease pressure slightly; that’s your cue she’s reaching threshold sensitivity. If she softens and exhales long, sustain tempo—that’s the window for Flow.
Reflection is simple: you’re not chasing speed, you’re building precision. The more exact your wall contact, the faster arousal compounds. Journal what you feel in plain terms: “North wall, shallow, steady pressure, long exhale at rep six.” That sentence records what worked, and those notes are your reference for refinement in later modules.

Module 4 begins the Tracking Phase, where you refine the Zig Zag’s shallow execution through deliberate observation. Start in your forearm plank, knees grounded, shoulders above wrists, pelvis steady. Inhale deeply to set your baseline, and exhale into the North Drop so the head and top ridge of your penis align against her north wall. This is the shallow 80% zone—the layer of warmth and glide before any resistance builds. Keep pressure at Light-to-Medium so your sensitivity stays alive. For an ectomorph, precision is the strength. Your body’s length gives you reach; use it to draw clean, measurable lines rather than force. Each forward glide is a test, not a performance.
Begin each mini-set with three forward-back cycles. On the first cycle, track how much friction you feel along the top shelf. On the second, track how her breathing changes. On the third, track your own ease of movement. When her breath deepens or her hips tilt slightly upward, mark that as “entry point found.” Return to baseline, inhale, and start again. That repetition is the SSP loop in action—Define, Hypothesize, Track, Refine. If the glides feel too light, increase pressure by a fraction—never by depth. Your below-five-inch length favors consistent wall contact over penetration shifts. Each keystroke should end with full awareness of your contact patch on her north wall.
Keep your breath synchronized to prevent early fatigue. Inhale during recovery, exhale through each forward glide, letting the air drive the motion from your diaphragm down. Think of it as surfing a small wave—you’re not stabbing through; you’re catching the surface flow and staying on it. Watch for partner cues: a long exhale means you’re on rhythm, a still pelvis means she’s feeling cumulative tension, a sudden inhale means lighten the glide slightly. Adjust with micro-tilts from the hips, not from thrusts.
As you refine, note any pattern where arousal spikes or fades. If it builds on longer exhalations, extend the rhythm; if it fades, reset baseline and relaunch. This is the real feedback loop. End each set with a complete reset: lift the chest slightly, inhale, relax the core, and let her body settle before the next run. For journaling, write one line that captures the feedback: “North wall, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, hips tilted 2°, breath match steady.” Over time, these entries become your data for precision and endurance calibration.

===========================================================================================




Module 5 now transitions you from Tracking into Flow—sustaining a smooth, repeatable rhythm on the Zig Zag’s shallow north-wall glide. Begin from your forearm plank baseline, elbows under shoulders, knees lightly grounded. Inhale to lengthen your spine and set your pelvis neutral; exhale into the first north-wall glide using Light-to-Medium pressure. The goal here is continuity, not force. Keep contact constant between the top ridge of your penis and her north wall for the full forward-and-back cycle, allowing your ectomorph frame to rely on reach and hip angle rather than muscular push.
Each movement should feel like tracing the edge of a wave with the board’s underside. As you exhale through the forward glide, let your hips draw a tiny semicircle—just enough Angling to stay locked on the wall. On the inhale, return along the same path without losing surface pressure. This shallow zone—your 80 percent band—is where sensation builds gradually through consistency. Keep your pressure steady, breathing even, tempo slow enough that you can feel her body answering with soft contractions or a heavier exhale. If she starts to arch subtly or her breath catches, you’re locked onto the right vector.
The main challenge for a below-five-inch length is maintaining wall continuity at the end of each stroke. Solve that by controlling pelvis height; a small lift breaks contact, so instead rock from your forearms, keeping your hips floating low. Your upper body should be the engine; your pelvis only steers. Let your breath drive tempo—inhale on recovery, exhale through glide. If fatigue creeps into your shoulders, widen the elbow base slightly and shorten the travel distance until stability returns.
Once rhythm holds, begin counting silent cycles in sets of ten. This teaches the nervous system what sustainable Flow feels like. You’ll sense her shifting from noticing you to following you; her body will pulse instead of tense. Stay in that zone until you feel your own breathing synchronize with hers. End each run by easing pressure, lifting the chest slightly, and letting both bodies settle. In your journal, note the feel with one short line: “North wall, shallow 80%, Medium pressure, breath sync at rep 7.” Over time this line becomes your signature pattern of Flow for this stroke.

===========================================================================================




Module 6 for the Zig Zag stroke now expands your control into the mid-zone, where pressure and depth amplify pleasure while demanding precision. Begin from the same forearm-plank baseline, but allow your knees to drift slightly farther back so the line from shoulders to hips lengthens. This creates a lower pelvic trajectory and better control of insertion angle. Inhale deeply to prepare; as you exhale, glide forward using Medium pressure into the mid 10 percent band. Keep the top ridge of your penis brushing the north wall as you ease deeper, never driving straight in. The action must remain a Rocking-Angling blend—hips glide while chest weight stabilizes through the forearms. For an ectomorph with a below-five-inch length, this is your sweet spot: depth control and wall contact fused.
If you imagine painting a stripe with the top edge of a brush, you’ll understand the mechanic. Each forward push should sweep the north wall in a narrow band, never slamming the cervix. The breath remains the regulator—inhale to prepare the back glide, exhale to press forward with steady pressure. Hard pressure risks collapsing the wall’s feedback, so remain within Medium intensity. When your alignment is correct, you’ll feel her pelvic tilt subtly upward and her exhale lengthen—signals that the mid-depth stimulation is landing. If instead she tenses or shortens breath, back out one inch, reset the pelvis slightly lower, and resume at the shallow 80 percent range.
Because ectomorph bodies tend to fatigue faster in isometric holds, anchor your elbows wide enough to share the load between triceps and lats. Every ten strokes, lift the hips two inches and let your shoulders roll back for a single breath before re-engaging. This preserves stamina without breaking rhythm. The goal here is to flirt with depth, not claim it. You are testing mid-zone pressure integrity—tracking how her body responds to expansion. If lubrication begins to thicken, it means arousal is deepening; if it thins or she withdraws slightly, it signals overstimulation. Adjust your tempo rather than force, slowing exhale length to regain synchronicity.
Toward the close of each set, practice the “soft landing” exit: ease pressure in reverse without pulling fully out, allowing her muscles to close the gap. This keeps sensitivity alive and ready for the next sequence. Journal the experience as a single cue line: “North wall, mid 10%, Medium pressure, exhale lengthened at rep nine.” Over repeated sessions, this becomes the tactile reference that guides safe expansion and wall continuity across Flow and Pinning phases.

===========================================================================================




Module 7 for the Zig Zag stroke focuses on post-orgasm mastery—maintaining rhythm, sensitivity, and connection instead of collapsing into rest. Begin again in your forearm plank baseline, hips aligned just above hers, breath steady. As she peaks, do not chase the tempo. Observe instead. Watch for her breath pause, a full-body stillness, or a subtle inward curl of her hips—these are the cues that signal her climax wave. In that instant, your goal is not to retreat but to refine. Ease the pressure to Light, anchor your exhale, and shift micro-angles along the north wall in finger-width increments. The Zig Zag’s lateral quality allows you to glide her nerve endings sideways rather than pound forward, helping her transition from peak into rolling aftershocks.
Each micro-adjustment should come from the elbows and hips together, using Rocking rather than thrusting. Think of yourself as stirring warmth just below the surface—your motion short, smooth, and deliberate. Stay in the shallow 80 percent zone during this phase to preserve sensitivity and avoid overstimulation, especially with an ectomorph body where endurance must be guarded through pacing. The narrower your frame, the more fatigue gathers in the shoulders, so ground your chest weight evenly through the forearms and let your spine extend long to distribute the load. Inhale through stillness, exhale as you make each micro-shift. This breath-linked rhythm prevents mechanical repetition and keeps the movement alive and reactive to her body.
As the contractions fade, return slowly toward mid-zone entry with controlled Medium pressure. Her hips will tell you when it’s time: if they follow your forward motion or rise to meet you, stay; if they settle, hover. These minute readings form your Observe–Tweak–Test loop: Observe her cues, Tweak angle or pressure, Test with two or three gentle Rockings. If she sighs, breathes deeper, or keeps her pelvis tilted, you’ve reignited response. If she pulls inward or quiets too far, lift to shallow 80% again and glide laterally until her breath finds you. The Zig Zag excels here because the upper ridge of your shaft naturally keeps sensory continuity even during reduced depth, which is crucial for men with below-five-inch length—stimulation without forcing penetration.
After a full sequence of post-orgasm glides, retreat to your neutral plank, breathe out completely, and let your hips hang loose for two breaths before disengaging. Reflect immediately: what wall did she respond to most, what pressure sustained her breathing, what depth felt mutual? Write a single shorthand entry—“North wall, shallow, Light pressure, reawakened after hold at rep seven.” This keeps your nervous system tuned to the nuances of reentry and multiple-wave potential.

===========================================================================================




Module 8 for the Zig Zag stroke centers on integration and mastery—the bridge between solo training and instinctive execution. Begin each session in a calm forearm plank, finding your neutral baseline before adding motion. Your goal over the next four weeks is not speed or endurance, but consistency of precision. As an ectomorph with a below-average length, your body naturally favors sensitivity and finesse over force. This means your posture, pressure, and pacing become your tools for dominance. Each training session should open with slow shallow Rocking at Light pressure, inhaling through entry and exhaling through glide. Let your shoulders spread and your spine stay long to minimize fatigue in your upper body. As your warmth rises, move into your mid-range Medium pressure shuttles, sustaining rhythm for three to four breath cycles before returning to rest.
In the first week, dedicate your practice to mastering the north-wall navigation at shallow 80%. Focus on clarity and relaxation rather than stamina. The second week should blend shallow and mid-depth contact, holding the top shelf of your shaft steady along the wall while you guide pressure laterally. This teaches your body how to sustain stimulation without excess movement—a critical foundation for your build type. In the third week, increase tempo slightly, maintaining flow for longer sequences while preserving alignment. Remember that your leverage is earned through control, not size. Even the smallest adjustment in hip angle—two degrees of Rocking—can generate amplified sensitivity in her north wall. In the final week, you should begin chaining full Zig Zag sequences, starting from shallow, gliding forward into mid, then retreating, all under one breath rhythm. This forms your final neural groove.
Recovery and rest hygiene matter as much as repetition. Because an ectomorph frame is leaner and more prone to shoulder fatigue, include short rests between sets by dropping to your knees and shaking out your arms for ten seconds. Maintain hydration and stretch the wrists after every session. Stamina will build from steadiness, not strain. Your penis size means depth should stay below the deep 10% zone; your power lies in lateral reach and constant surface contact, not insertion length. Treat the north wall as your canvas and your shaft as the brush, tracing steady lines that invite her body to open rather than recoil.
Track your growth through sensation notes rather than performance metrics. One line per day is enough—“North wall steady, Light to Medium, pressure clean, breathing matched, hips curled in at cycle eight.” Over weeks, you will begin to feel how the Zig Zag becomes less of a motion and more of an instinctive pulse. When done correctly, your body will move without conscious effort, guided only by breath and her cues. At that point, you are not performing a stroke—you are living it.
