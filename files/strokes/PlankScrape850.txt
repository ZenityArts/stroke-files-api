Module 1 for Plank Scrape builds the physical foundation—the forearm-plank posture, the alignment that keeps every joint safe, and the depth control that lets you feel the right wall without strain. Begin by setting your forearms on the canvas, elbows stacked directly under shoulders, palms flat, and knees on the mat behind you. Your spine should form one long line from crown to tailbone. This is your neutral baseline, the place you always return to. It’s where stability and sensitivity begin. Inhale slowly through your nose, letting your abdomen expand downward toward the canvas. Exhale through your mouth and let your pelvis settle, feeling the hips draw slightly forward without collapsing. For an Endomorph body, weight distribution matters—keep your core active so the shoulders don’t bear all the load. Your mass creates natural pressure, so the key is control, not drive.
When you first move in plank, think of your pelvis as a slow pendulum. The hips rock forward and back across a small range, never more than a few finger-widths. This Rocking is the base mechanic of the Plank Scrape. It sends the shaft gliding through the shallow 80 percent of depth. Each forward Rock begins on an exhale, each backward draw on an inhale. Pressure stays Light to Medium; that’s how you learn precision before power. With Above-7-inch length, the aim is partial penetration only—the top 80 percent of range allows friction to spread across her walls without impact. Imagine the shaft as a brush painting a line across the canvas of her body; your job is to feel how that line changes with angle and pressure.
From the neutral plank, introduce gentle Angling. Tilt your hips a few degrees left, then right, keeping the Rocking alive. When you lean Left, pressure travels to her Right wall; when you lean Right, it shifts to her Left wall. These small Angles are the compass points you’ll map later in training. Stay shallow, stay patient. The breath anchors every lean—inhale to reset, exhale to move. For Endomorph leverage, the glutes must stay engaged to hold the hips steady; if you relax them too soon, your weight sinks and shoulder tension builds. Think of the pelvis as the rudder steering the whole vessel. She will feel this subtle steering as a change in direction more than depth, and her first cue may be a deeper exhale or a quiet stillness beneath you.
During these first sessions, the goal is awareness, not endurance. Practice holding neutral baseline for a count of ten breaths, then add gentle Rocks for another ten, then reset. Your wrists, shoulders, and spine must never feel compressed. If they do, shift weight backward an inch or widen your knees until the load spreads evenly. The Endomorph’s advantage is power; the discipline is restraint. Let the rhythm form from breath rather than muscle. For Above-7-inch training, always stop short of the deep 10 percent—your control of entry depth is your safety and her comfort. When she breathes deeper or her hips draw you in, that’s confirmation you’re in the right range.
Each practice ends by returning to full neutral plank, breathing deep through the nose, and letting every muscle release its grip. The journal line for today might read: “Neutral baseline held ten breaths, shallow 80 percent Rock, Medium pressure, her breath deepened at rep five.” This note anchors what you felt and what she mirrored. It is how you begin to track progress through the SSP loop—define, test, observe, refine. Mastering this baseline is the key that unlocks the rest of the stroke. Without it, precision collapses.

======================================================================================================================
Module 2 for Plank Scrape isolates and trains the keystrokes that form its structure. Every stroke you will ever build depends on mastering these building blocks in motion, pressure, and breath. The two main keystrokes here are the Lean and Drop, and the Vertical Lift and Re-scrape, performed first to the Left and then mirrored to the Right. Begin from your neutral forearm-plank baseline, knees grounded, core active, and spine long. Your shoulders and wrists should feel balanced, your breath calm and even. This is your home position—the place you return to between every action.
Start with the Left Lean and Drop. From baseline, inhale through the nose to stabilize, then exhale as you guide your hips slightly toward the Left. This movement tilts the angle of penetration so the shaft’s head and body press into her Right wall. The action combines Rocking and Angling—your pelvis moves forward and down in a smooth diagonal. The depth zone stays shallow to mid, occupying the top 80 percent with a brief pass into the mid 10 percent only at the bottom of each drop. Pressure begins Light, rising to Medium at the moment of contact, and then softens as you return to baseline. For an Endomorph body, use your abdominal control to guide the weight rather than falling into the lean; your natural mass already adds pressure. For Above-7-inch length, this motion should feel like sliding rather than thrusting—the scrape across the Right wall gives her broad friction without triggering depth tension. She may respond with a deeper breath or a slight pelvic curl. Those are cues of positive stimulation. If she stiffens or her breath shortens, reduce angle or pressure. Reflect afterward by writing, “Left Lean, shallow 80, Medium pressure, breath deepened on exhale four.”
Next is the Left Vertical Lift and Re-scrape. From the bottom of the drop, inhale and lift the hips upward and slightly backward while keeping the Left lean. This extracts along the same Right wall, generating controlled friction during withdrawal. The quality is mostly Rocking, with a hint of Angling that maintains the wall contact. Depth transitions from mid back to shallow, and pressure from Medium back to Light. For Endomorph frames, control the upward lift with your core rather than pushing through arms; this spares the shoulders and keeps alignment clean. For Above-7-inch length, stop the lift before the tip leaves her completely—this sustains internal contact and prevents loss of rhythm. She will often soften under this glide, exhaling gently. That softness signals success; continue at the same tempo or hold the angle briefly before repeating.
Now switch to the Right Lean and Drop. Inhale in neutral, exhale as you tilt your hips toward the Right, pressing the shaft diagonally into her Left wall. Rocking and Angling combine again, mirrored across the axis. The stroke remains shallow to mid, the pressure Medium at contact, and the breath steady. The Endomorph must engage obliques to steer the lean rather than using body weight to fall into it. The above-average length trainee must cap range at shallow depth to maintain comfort. If she breathes longer or presses hips upward, that’s confirmation the Left wall is engaging. Note any differences between sides—they often feel asymmetrical.
Finish with the Right Vertical Lift and Re-scrape. Inhale as you rise, maintaining the Right lean and tracing back along her Left wall. Rocking provides the lift, Angling sustains friction, and pressure eases from Medium to Light as the shaft withdraws. Her likely cues include a sigh or small pelvic pulse; those mark rhythm alignment. For Endomorph alignment, avoid twisting the lower back by keeping ribs and hips level. For Above-7-inch penetration, maintain shallow gating; long strokes can overwhelm nerve endings and disrupt flow. Journal it simply: “Right scrape shallow, Medium pressure, hips pressed in at rep six.”
These four keystrokes—Left Drop, Left Lift, Right Drop, Right Lift—form the stroke’s full vocabulary. Train them individually until each feels distinct. Then practice switching between Left and Right every few breaths, always resetting to neutral baseline. This teaches your body how Rocking and Angling cooperate to control direction and wall contact. She feels it as a consistent rhythm that never loses precision, even when you change sides. Each practice session ends by holding neutral plank for three slow breaths, letting your shoulders, spine, and hips release evenly. That closure anchors muscle memory and protects joints from fatigue.

======================================================================================================================
Module 3 for Plank Scrape connects the isolated keystrokes into a full stroke rhythm. You are now building the continuous loop—the alternating Left and Right sequences that turn controlled motion into instinctive flow. Begin in neutral forearm-plank position with your breath slow and spine lengthened. Feel the weight evenly distributed between forearms and knees, your pelvis floating just enough to allow smooth movement. This baseline is your command center; every chain begins and ends here. Inhale deeply through your nose, then exhale through your mouth, letting your hips settle into readiness.
Start with one Left-side cycle: exhale as you Lean and Drop toward the Left, letting the shaft trace her Right wall through the shallow 80 percent. Pause momentarily at the base where pressure peaks at Medium, then inhale as you Lift and Re-scrape vertically along that same wall. This single drop-lift combination completes one half of the stroke’s rhythm. Reset briefly in neutral, take one stabilizing breath, then exhale into the mirrored Right-side cycle—Lean and Drop Right to stimulate her Left wall, inhale and Lift back to neutral. When linked together, these four motions create a looping rhythm that feels like a slow, side-to-side scrape. Rocking provides depth momentum while Angling sculpts direction. The key is not speed but precision. Each exhale drives movement; each inhale restores balance.
As you chain cycles together, keep your hips low and movements smooth, never jerky. For an Endomorph body, the danger is using momentum rather than control—your natural power must be restrained through core engagement. Think of pulling your navel toward your spine on every inhale to keep the hips from sagging. For Above-7-inch length, gate the motion so penetration stays in the shallow zone. Your goal is to create broad friction rather than deep impact. Her body will tell you when alignment is right: a low moan, a longer exhale, or a press of her hips toward yours. These are green lights to maintain pace. If she stiffens or shifts away, adjust by decreasing angle or slowing the lift.
Run these sequences in small sets of four cycles—Left, Right, Left, Right—then pause in neutral to breathe and observe. Each reset reestablishes spinal alignment and prepares for the next set. Over time, you will learn to chain sets into continuous motion without losing structure. Imagine a pendulum crossing the center line, steady and predictable. This consistency is the essence of stroke rhythm. It lets her body anticipate pressure waves, creating the trance-like focus that amplifies pleasure. The internal effect for you is increased proprioception—hips, abdomen, and breath begin working as a single engine.
The SSP loop applies here: Define your goal (even rhythm, equal wall contact), Hypothesize adjustments (slower breath or smaller angle), Track her cues, and Refine with each set. A short journal line might read, “Left-Right cycle at shallow 80, Medium pressure, steady exhale, hips responded evenly.” This record builds awareness and allows you to spot small inconsistencies before they become habits. For Endomorphs, maintain shoulder relaxation and widen knee stance slightly if lower-back tension appears. For Above-7-inch training, resist temptation to chase deeper zones; control and accuracy now matter more than range.
Over multiple sessions, your neural patterning sharpens—the brain links breath to movement, movement to sensation, and sensation to feedback. When these pathways lock, the stroke becomes a living rhythm rather than an exercise. You are sculpting coordination and sensitivity simultaneously. Always end by returning to neutral plank, holding steady for three full breaths, and letting every joint unload. This pause closes the circuit and prevents fatigue.

======================================================================================================================
Module 4 for Plank Scrape enters the Tracking phase—the deliberate testing ground where you refine wall contact, tempo, and partner response inside the shallow 80 percent. This is where technique transforms into intelligence. Begin in your neutral forearm-plank baseline with your breath low and steady. Inhale deeply, exhale through your mouth, and feel your core tighten around your spine. Tracking means slowing everything down to notice what happens at each wall, angle, and pressure level. You’re no longer building strength; you’re building precision.
Start by focusing only on the Left Lean and Drop. Exhale as your hips tilt left, pressing the shaft’s body along her Right wall. Keep depth shallow—just inside, no further than eighty percent of your total length. Maintain Light-to-Medium pressure and draw your awareness to what she does in real time. If her breath deepens, if her hips curl or still, those are confirmation cues that this wall is alive. If she holds tension or shifts away, reduce angle and lighten pressure on your next repetition. After two or three repetitions, return to baseline, inhale fully, and let your muscles reset. This baseline breath is what keeps your awareness sharp. For Endomorphs, focus on distributing weight evenly through core and thighs, keeping shoulders loose. Your natural heaviness can become an ally when managed correctly—it anchors you and stabilizes tempo. For Above-7-inch penetration, depth control is mandatory; overextension here turns feedback into resistance rather than connection.
Next, move to the Right Lean and Drop. The same shallow depth applies. Exhale as your hips tilt right, and let the head of your shaft scrape her Left wall. Pressure remains Medium; the feeling should be wide and smooth, not pointed or driving. Track her cues: a deeper sigh, a pulse through her lower belly, or subtle stillness. Note which wall provokes stronger responses. This comparison forms your first data point. You are running micro-tests—one wall at a time, same depth, same tempo. After each mini-set, breathe in, reset, and journal one simple reflection like, “Right wall, shallow 80, Medium pressure, hips pressed in at rep three.” These brief notes sharpen your recall when you return for Flow practice later.
Once both walls have been tested separately, begin alternating Left and Right cycles in slow rhythm. Let breath guide every motion: inhale to prepare, exhale through action. Keep your focus on pressure consistency—each wall should feel equally activated. For Endomorph training, check your lower back; if strain appears, pull your knees half an inch back to reduce lumbar load. For Above-7-inch length, sustain shallow depth so friction stays controlled. As you track, small adjustments matter—tiny reductions in angle can smooth resistance and heighten her sensitivity.
The SSP loop governs this phase. Define your current variable—say, “angle sharpness.” Hypothesize what adjustment might improve contact—perhaps “reduce angle by five degrees.” Track her response—observe breathing, motion, sound. Refine on the next repetition. This cycle should repeat across every compass wall until you can predict her body’s answer before it happens. That anticipation is mastery taking root. She will feel this awareness in your pacing; it tells her you’re listening without words.
Close the session with a full neutral hold for three deep breaths. Let the spine lengthen, shoulders melt, and pelvis return to center. The purpose of the hold is to let the nervous system absorb what it learned. Reflect mentally: which wall gave stronger cues? Which breath count felt most aligned with your rhythm? Write a final shorthand journal tag like, “Left stronger, 80 shallow, angle soft, calm sync.” These small details become your guideposts for Flow. Precision is born here—in the quiet repetition where movement, breath, and observation converge.

======================================================================================================================
Module 5 for Plank Scrape transitions you into Flow—the moment the motion becomes music. The goal is to sustain rhythm through the shallow 80 percent, maintaining friction and presence without losing control. Begin from your neutral forearm-plank baseline. Take one deep inhale, feel your abdomen expand, and exhale slowly until your body settles into alignment. The forearms ground you, the hips float, the spine holds tension like a bowstring ready to release. Flow is built from this poised stillness.
Start the sequence with a Left Lean and Drop followed immediately by a Left Lift and Re-scrape, then cross into Right Lean and Drop, Right Lift and Re-scrape. Let the movement form a gentle side-to-side pendulum. Inhale on the lifts, exhale through the drops. Each full cycle—Left to Right—should feel seamless, the breath and body moving as one. Keep the depth in the shallow zone to preserve contact clarity; this allows her internal walls to sense pressure changes distinctly rather than being overwhelmed by depth. For Endomorph bodies, maintain a stable base through the thighs and abdomen, keeping shoulders relaxed. For Above-7-inch penetration, this depth gate is essential; it ensures every scrape registers as sensation, not strain.
The pressure remains within Light to Medium bands. Imagine tracing along the inside of her walls like polishing curved glass—consistent, even, no jabs. Rocking drives vertical lift; Angling defines the diagonal lean. Together they form the flow signature of the Plank Scrape. She will feel it as a rolling friction wave, one wall activating as the other releases. When you are balanced, her breathing naturally synchronizes with yours—long exhales during your downward motions, subtle pelvic pulls on the lifts. These reflexes are your live feedback loop. If her rhythm shortens or hips withdraw, slow your tempo and soften your angle. The Flow phase is less about repetition count and more about holding connection.
To sustain stamina, think in waves: run eight to ten cycles, then return to baseline for one breath reset. Each pause lets your muscles release and your awareness refocus. This is especially critical for Endomorphs—your body carries more mass, so micro-rests prevent lower-back fatigue. Use abdominal engagement instead of brute strength to steer hips side to side. For Above-7-inch size, maintain a smaller stroke window; the longer shaft amplifies pressure naturally, so even short glides feel full to her. Flow is maintained by consistency, not size.
The 80–10–10 model still applies here: 80 percent of your motion should remain shallow, 10 percent may brush the mid zone, and only fleetingly if her cues allow it. The aim is fluid surface friction across her internal walls, not impact. If lubrication dips or her reactions flatten, take a neutral hold for one breath cycle and restart. Think of each restart as a soft reset that keeps the nervous system aligned. The SSP loop continues quietly under the rhythm—Observe her responses, Tweak your tempo or pressure slightly, Test the effect, and fold the adjustment seamlessly into the next movement.
A simple journal reflection after Flow might read, “Full cycles, shallow 80, Medium pressure, steady breath, hips synced by rep twelve.” These notes remind you what equilibrium feels like. Over multiple sessions, you will sense Flow not just as technique but as timing—the invisible harmony between two bodies. It’s the phase where physical accuracy evolves into emotional fluency. Your task is to keep that fluency without letting ego or tension distort the rhythm.
Ready to proceed to Module 6 for Plank Scrape with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


======================================================================================================================
Module 6 for Plank Scrape expands into the deep option—the mid and deep 10 percent zones. This is the controlled descent, where precision and restraint matter more than depth itself. Begin in your neutral forearm-plank baseline, take one long inhale, and let the spine settle into a smooth line from crown to tailbone. The purpose of this module is not to chase deeper penetration but to navigate it with surgical awareness. Your body is heavier as an Endomorph and your leverage greater, so every inch of descent multiplies pressure. For an Above-7-inch size, even the smallest overreach can crowd her cervix or flatten the rhythm. Depth now becomes an exercise in control, not force.
On the first cycle, exhale slowly as you Drop toward your chosen side, allowing the shaft to trace down the wall from the shallow 80 percent into the mid 10. The angle remains diagonal—Left Lean pressing her Right wall or Right Lean pressing her Left wall. Feel for resistance, not in your muscles but in her internal texture. Mid-zone friction feels denser, more contained. The moment resistance spikes, hold the pressure steady without driving deeper. Breathe through your nose, exhaling slowly to relax your pelvic floor. She will often mirror this by exhaling or softening beneath you—a cue that you’re on threshold but still within safety. When the body stiffens, cervix sensitivity has been triggered. Back off immediately to shallow range and re-establish flow.
Alternate Left and Right mid-zone entries in small test runs. Each drop lasts one full exhale; each return to shallow is paired with an inhale. The motion feels like a tide drawing in, then sliding back to shore. Use Light pressure on entry, building to Medium only after confirming comfort through her response. Never exceed Medium in the mid 10. For Endomorphs, shift slightly forward in plank to reduce downward torque on the lower back; your mass will naturally increase depth, so compensate with angle rather than thrust. For Above-7-inch training, keep hips elevated an inch higher than usual so that the deepest zone remains grazed, not struck. This protects both alignment and intimacy.
When lubrication or rhythm changes, pause fully in neutral. The Flow rhythm must remain unbroken; deep work only counts if it’s continuous with the shallow sequence. Re-enter the shallow 80 percent with a few Rocking strokes to re-establish glide. Think of the deep option as punctuation—a brief exhale that resets arousal waves before returning to the main rhythm. She will feel these controlled descents as sudden expansions followed by relief; that contrast magnifies pleasure. If she draws her hips inward or breathes sharply, those are signals that depth has hit its limit. Adjust by shifting the diagonal or increasing the vertical lift.
At the end of your session, hold in neutral plank for three full breaths. This stillness allows your nervous system to store the pattern of controlled depth. Reflect quietly: did the mid-zone feel balanced? Did you sense where the edge of comfort lies? Write a single journal note like, “Right wall, mid 10, Light-Medium pressure, hips softened, depth clean at rep six.” Over time, these notes map your safe range. Depth is not dominance—it’s accuracy under pressure. Every repetition teaches the same lesson: control is the truest expression of power.

======================================================================================================================
Module 7 for Plank Scrape focuses on the Pinning phase—the post-orgasmic control window where precision amplifies sensitivity instead of exhausting it. Begin from your neutral forearm-plank baseline, spine elongated, pelvis centered, breath steady. Your muscles may still carry the pulse of Flow; that’s the moment to slow everything down. Pinning is not about new motion but refined micro-adjustment—observing her body’s aftershocks and guiding them into another wave without disrupting safety or rhythm.
Start with one full exhale and a soft Drop into the shallow 80 percent. Keep the angle minimal—Left or Right Lean just enough to engage one wall. The motion must be Light; even Medium pressure can overwhelm at this sensitivity stage. The SSP sequence—Observe, Tweak, Test—governs each cycle. Observe her breathing: if it steadies, she’s recovering; if it deepens, you’re reigniting arousal. Tweak angle or tempo by no more than a few degrees or a single breath count. Test by sustaining the change for three repetitions. Endomorph structure provides natural grounding here—use your mass as stability, not drive. Let gravity work through the forearms and core while hips float lightly. For Above-7-inch penetration, maintain even shallower range—around seventy percent insertion—to prevent the glans from pressing the cervix during post-climax contractions.
Alternate between Left and Right walls, staying within shallow depth, tracing slow Rocking arcs that feel like gentle tides washing over the same shoreline. She will often show stillness or subtle inward pulses—these are cues that her body is processing pleasure rather than resisting it. Match your breathing to hers. Inhale as her body softens; exhale as you move. This synchrony calms the nervous system for both of you and primes her for multiple waves. If her hips lift or her breath sharpens again, that’s your sign to build slight momentum. Increase tempo marginally—perhaps a second faster—and deepen pressure from Light to Medium while maintaining the same wall contact. Pinning is all about detecting these micro-thresholds and modulating pressure just enough to keep sensation rising.
If fatigue begins to build, pause in neutral plank for one breath. Let the arms relax, spine lengthen, and hips hover still. These tiny breaks prevent lower-back overload, especially important for Endomorph frames carrying more torque. Then re-enter on the opposite wall with a fresh inhale, exhaling through the next micro-cycle. This alternation keeps blood flow steady and maintains her perception of continual touch without roughness. Think of it as playing a note that fades and returns, never breaking tone.
Toward the end of the session, test a three-cycle escalation: first pass at Light pressure, second at Medium, third returning to Light. Observe whether her body follows with layered responses—a deeper exhale, a curling pelvis, or a subtle shiver. These are physiological confirmations that you’ve triggered post-orgasmic resonance rather than fatigue. After the third cycle, hold in neutral again for three full breaths, allowing everything to reset.
Conclude by journaling one clean line such as, “Left wall shallow, Light-Medium-Light, hips curled at rep two, breathing synced.” This reflection trains your awareness for future sessions. Pinning teaches you the art of sustaining presence beyond climax—proof that mastery is endurance in stillness as much as in motion.
Ready to proceed to Module 8 for Plank Scrape with Body Type Endomorph and Penis Size Above 7 inches?


======================================================================================================================
Module 8 for Plank Scrape integrates everything you’ve trained into a structured four-week practice plan. The purpose is to turn technique into reflex—where posture, rhythm, breath, and wall awareness fuse into instinct. Every practice session builds from the same foundation: a neutral forearm-plank baseline, a centered breath, and a slow ignition of rhythm that prioritizes control over intensity. This final module refines consistency, endurance, and emotional steadiness under load.
Across the first week, your focus is posture and clarity. Begin each session with five minutes of forearm-plank setup—align shoulders over elbows, spine straight, pelvis neither dropped nor arched. Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth, grounding the abdomen and feeling the entire body as a single connected lever. Move through shallow 80-percent Plank Scrape cycles for ten to twelve minutes, alternating Left and Right leans every five reps. Keep all pressure Light and slow, matching one breath per full cycle. As an Endomorph, this period trains joint endurance and pelvic precision. For Above-7-inch size, it hardcodes shallow control so depth remains deliberate. Each evening, jot a one-line reflection such as, “Center steady, Right wall clean, shallow Light pressure, full control.”
In week two, layer in Flow rhythm. Begin with posture warmup, then build tempo to continuous Rocking for twelve to fifteen minutes. Alternate walls, maintain 80-percent depth, and aim for unbroken rhythm through breath synchronization. At this stage, she would feel the glide as continuous motion rather than separate strokes. This week is about sustaining connection without slipping into mechanical repetition. If you feel fatigue, pause for a single neutral breath before resuming. These mini-resets prevent back strain and sharpen proprioception—your awareness of movement precision.
Week three introduces controlled mid-zone depth. After a ten-minute shallow warmup, test brief descents into the mid 10 percent—no more than one per five cycles. These punctuations create a contrast that refines depth control. Use Light to Medium pressure only, tracking her likely cues—deeper exhale, hips curling in, or stillness. Keep duration under twenty minutes total. Endomorph leverage requires core stability; focus on transferring force through the abdomen, not the lower back. For Above-7-inch penetration, never drop full weight—your goal is subtle reach, not impact.
The final week is full integration. Begin with shallow rhythm, test mid-zone entries, and close with Pinning control. Total training time should reach twenty to twenty-five minutes, including resets. The body will start anticipating balance between left and right automatically, breathing in sync with movement. Journal reflections after each session, noting specific compass cues and breath anchors. An example entry might read, “Left wall flow, mid 10 Light pressure, hips relaxed, breathing matched, finish smooth.”
Rest hygiene is crucial here. Take a full rest day between sessions to allow joints and core muscles to recover. Stretch hips and lower back post-session to release tension. Keep hydration high to sustain lubrication sensitivity when in live practice. Over time, this plan transforms the Plank Scrape from an isolated drill into a seamless skill—movement becomes language, breath becomes rhythm, depth becomes dialogue.
By the end of this module, the motion should feel effortless, the awareness automatic. The Plank Scrape, when mastered under 80–10–10 and SSP discipline, is no longer a stroke but a precision instrument—anchored, rhythmic, and emotionally present.
